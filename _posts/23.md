Hurd and Brown collaborated on two of the most enduring and beloved children's books of all time: Goodnight Moon and The Runaway Bunny. The famous tale of a verbal hide-and-seek game which describes a mother's enduring love for her curious little bunny was first published in 1942, has never been out of print, and sold millions of copies worldwide. In 1972, Hurd republished the iconic work with revised illustrations that kept the spirit of the original and was embraced by a new generation of readers.As far as we are able to determine, no original illustration for either edition of The Runaway Bunny has come to auction previously. Hurd's papers and most of the original studies for this and other works are housed in the Clement Hurd archive at University of Minnesota Libraries Children's Literature Research Collections."
