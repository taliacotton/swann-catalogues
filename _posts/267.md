Dow Walling was a self-taught comic artist born and raised on a farm outside of Bellingham, Washington. His childhood upbringing is reflected in the adventures of the spunky young protagonist in his popular comic strip “Skeets,” which ran in the Sunday New York Herald Tribune and was nationally syndicated from 1932 until 1951. Walling also created a short-lived series for Johnson Features syndicate called “Campus Cowboys,” before selling his cartoons to Life, Judge, and College Humor. He began working on numerous existing cartoons with King Features syndicate in 1931 before he was approached by the Tribune to create “Skeets.”"
