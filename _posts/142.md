TYPESET: "ALEXANDRA EXTER (1882-1949)\nConstructivist cityscape. Set design for an unidentified production. Graphite on paper. 228x297 mm; 9x11¾ on 10x13-inch sheet, with second design on verso showing decorative scrollwork in ink surrounding a pencil sketch of a central female figure standing on a windy hilltop, measuring roughly 210x253 mm; 8¼x10 inches. Signed \"A Exter\" in ink, lower right recto, number 17X139.Provenance: Gift of the artist to her student, Vera Cohn; thence by descent.Based on similar drawings, Exter likely created this design while working for the theater ensemble of Alexander Tairov in Moscow in the 1910s. While there, she created numerous costumes for various productions and designed sets that transformed two-dimensional stage spaces into three-dimensional abstract structures by incorporating multi-level platforms that would be illuminated by intersecting rays of light."
