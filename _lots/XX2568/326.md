CROSSHEAD: "[SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY.] Complete series of 31 plates. Circa 1936."
at-a-glance: "Each 22¾x14½ inches, 57¾x46¾ cm."
TYPESET: "An exceptional, and virtually unexplainable series of linoleum-cut prints with a decidedly comic, yet at times virulent, anti-capitalist theme. Amongst the recognizable motifs are pro-labor, anti-capitalist, pro-worker and overall socialist imagery. However the irony, sarcasm and in some cases, the patently absurd messages, become confusing. Paul Herzel was a German sculptor, about whom little is known. Images available upon request."
