TYPESET: "Color crayons and pencil on wove paper, 1962.  195x255 mm; 7¾x10⅛ inches.  Initialed and dated in pencil, lower right recto.  <br><br>Provenance: Private collection, New Jersey.<br><br>Diller (1906-1965) explored the concept of tension between planes of movement in his works.  Within this concept, he separated his works into three visual themes: \"First Theme\" works were comprised of geometric shapes floating on a flat plane; \"Second Theme\" works, perhaps Diller's most ambiguous category, were compositions \"generated by continuous lines\"; and \"Third Theme\" works were of tight intersections, counterpoints, and \"linear interplay\".  Though enumerated, Diller noted that the themes do not evolve or devolve into one another and are not fixed categories.  Diller had announced these themes in literature accompanying his exhibition at the Rose Fried Gallery, New York in 1951, though as Barbara Haskell noted in the 1990 text for Diller's Whitney retrospective, \"Although helpful in identifying images, they inadvertently caused later errors in titling, since most of Diller's work was executed without reference to specific themes.\""
