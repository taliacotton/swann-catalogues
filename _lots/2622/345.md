  Multiples, Philadelphia.<br><br>According to the publisher's note, "Louis XVI, The
  Sun King is a Bernini influenced, Baroque style composition positioning a young
  man dressed in contemporary urban street attire styled as a 17th century monarch.  The
  heroic pose is vigorously alive and imperious.  The cloak, or hoodie in this case,
  is swept up, as if by a gust of wind, and the figure turns with resolute composure
  in the direction of the wind, as if calmly facing a challenge.<br><br> Born and
  raised in Los Angeles, based in New York, Wiley (born 1977) often inserts black
  protagonists into reappropriated Old Master paintings and sculpture.  The Columbus
  Museum of Art, Ohio, which hosted a major exhibition of Wiley's work in 2007 noted,
  "Wiley has gained recent acclaim for his heroic portraits which address the image
  and status of young African-American men in contemporary culture."
