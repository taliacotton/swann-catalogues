A very good impression of this extremely scarce, early print.<br><br>The scion of a Philippine sugar magnate, Ossorio (1916-1990) was one of the early practitioners of Abstract Expressionism, and in the 1950s he formed important artistic friendships with Jackson Pollock and Jean Dubuffet. They showed Ossorio the value of looking inward for inspiration, and his surrealistic imagery began to evolve into more abstract, outwardly expressionistic work."
