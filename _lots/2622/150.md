TYPESET: "Oil on board, 1980-85.  135x230 mm; 5¼z9⅛ inches.  Signed and dated in white crayon, verso.<br><br>Newell (1914-2006) was a self-taught artist born on Manhattan's Lower East Side.  His paintings are typified by richly-hued geometric forms in subtle juxtapositions and textures, heightened by an intimate scale and striking color harmonies.  He participated in the Group of American Abstract Expressionists and was a founding member of the Eighth Street Club, which also included Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky and Franz Kline.  Newell was not a prolific painter; his works number less than 100 and were often executed over decades, as he constantly refined his compositions with new colors until satisfied with the result.  Due to their continued reworkings, many of his paintings were up to an inch thick when completed, with a combined depth of wood support and layers of meticulously applied paint.<br><br>From January 18-March 9, 1996, Woodward Gallery, New York, hosted Newell's largest gallery exhibition to date, \"Roy Newell: Lifelines: 1955- 1995,” a 40-year retrospective and his first one-man show in a decade. <br><br>Provenance: Woodward Gallery, New York, with the label; private collection, New York."
