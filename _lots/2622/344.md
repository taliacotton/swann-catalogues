Published by Cerealart Multiples, Philadelphia.<br><br>This neoclassical-style bust was influenced by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres's (1780-1867) stained-glass window, Saint Francis of Adelaide in the Chapel of Saint Ferdinand, Paris. In Wiley's sculpture, Saint Francis becomes a strong, proud, athletic young man dressed in street attire and holding a bible, orb and scepter.<br><br> Born and raised in Los Angeles, based in New York, Wiley (born 1977) often inserts black protagonists into reappropriated Old Master paintings and sculpture.  The Columbus Museum of Art, Ohio, which hosted a major exhibition of Wiley's work in 2007 noted, \"Wiley has gained recent acclaim for his heroic portraits which address the image and status of young African-American men in contemporary culture.\""
