TYPESET: "Color lithograph on Barcham Green paper, 1971.  763x545 mm; 30x21Â½ inches, full margins.  Signed and numbered \"x 14/30\" in pencil, lower margin.  Printed by Curwen Studio, London, with the blind stamp lower left.  Published by Marlborough Fine Art, London.  From The Aegean Suite.  A very good impression of this scarce lithograph.<br><br>Hepworth (1903-1975) completed two major sets of lithographs with the Curwen Studio during her lifetime. The Aegean Suite was inspired by the Hepworth's visits to Greece and its ancient sites. Hepworth began the suite in 1970 from her studio in St. Ives and completed it with the master printer Stanley Jones MBE at the Curwen studio in Tottenham Court Road, London the following year.  Although Hepworth's graphic output was limited, she enjoyed printmaking as the intricacy of its layering process would allow her to develop ideas on space, abstraction, form and texture that she would later translate into her sculpture."
