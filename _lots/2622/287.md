Printed and published by Polígrafa, Barcelona.  Very good, well-inked impressions with strong colors.<br><br>Triptych is based on the same-titled, three-part work painted by Bacon (1909-1992) from 1974 to 1977.  This mysterious, foreboding work, one of the last in a series of triptychs that Bacon painted following the suicide of his long-time companion, George Dyer, in 1971 (Dyer killed himself in the Paris hotel room where he and Bacon were staying on the eve of the opening of a landmark retrospective of Bacon's work at the Grand Palais), is believed to represent Dyer struggling.<br><br>There are two printed versions of these three color aquatints with etching: one in which the three separate plates are printed on a single sheet of paper, like the current work, and the other with the three separate plates each printed on a separate sheet of paper (both versions were issued in an edition of 99, each pencil signed by Bacon and numbered).  Sabatier 4."
