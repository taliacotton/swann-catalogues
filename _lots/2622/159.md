Very good impressions with strong colors.<br><br>Chryssa Vardea-Mavromichali (1933-2013), who frequently used the mononym Chryssa professionally, was a Greek American artist who worked in a wide variety of media.  She was American art pioneer in light art and luminist sculpture, known for her neon, steel, aluminum and acrylic glass installations.  She worked from the mid-1950s in New York City studios and worked since 1992 in the studio she established in Neos Kosmos, Athens, Greece.  She was among the first artist to work closely with neon light, and in 1966 debuted The Gates to Times Square, a 10x10x10 feet cube installation consisting of two mammoth letter \"A\"s through which visitors walked into a gleaming block of stainless steel and Plexiglas enhanced by pale blue neon light controlled by programmed timers.  First shown at Pace Gallery, New York, it entered the collection of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo in 1972."
