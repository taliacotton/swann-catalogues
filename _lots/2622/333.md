TYPESET: "Acrylic, spray paint and collage on canvas, circa 1997.   1009x755 mm; 39¾x29¾ inches.<br><br>Rammellzee (1960-2010) was a visual artist, gothic futurist \"graffiti writer\", painter, performance artist, art theoretician, sculptor and a hip hop musician from Far Rockaway, Queens, New York, who has been cited as \"instrumental in introducing elements of the avant-garde into hip-hop culture.\"  Rammellzee's graffiti and art work are based on his theory of Gothic Futurism, which described as the battle between letters and their symbolic warfare against any standardizations enforced by the rules of the alphabet.  His treatise, Ionic treatise Gothic Futurism assassin knowledges of the remanipulated square point's one to 720° to 1440°, details an anarchic plan by which to revise the role and deployment of language in society.  Rammellzee's performance art included self-designed masks and costumes of different characters which represented the \"mathematical equation\" that embodied the artist himself.  On the basis of his Gothic Futurism approach, he described his artistic work as the logical extension into a new phase which he called Ikonoklast Panzerism.  Rammellzee's work can be found in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Museum of Graffiti, Miami. <br><br>Provenance:  Acquired directly from the artist by Tycoon Galleries, New Jersey; private collection, New Jersey, 2019."
