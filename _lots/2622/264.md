Published by the artist and Shark's Lithography, Ltd., Boulder.  <br><br>According to Bud Shark, the printer, \"The concept for the print was first worked on in 1981 at Anderson Ranch.  It took some time to work out a simple but effective method of moving the parts.  'The Mesa & Gas Station' were spotted by Red and me on a camping trip while driving through Kremmling, Colorado.  So we actually saw the scene that became the print.\"  Knestrick 96."
