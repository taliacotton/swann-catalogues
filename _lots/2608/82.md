DESCRIPT: PAUL ÉMILE BERTHON (1872-1909)
CROSSHEAD: The Marionette.
TYPESET: Maquette for unidentified, possibly unpublished poster or advertisement.
  A charming image of a young woman amusing two children with a jaunty Punch-like
  marionette puppet. Mixed media with watercolor, graphite, color pencil, and metallic
  paint on heavy paper backed in linen. 533x400 mm; 21x15¾ inches. Signed and dated
  "Paul Berthon . 98 ." in upper right corner. Float-mounted to silk-covered matte
  in a handsome Art Nouveau frame measuring 29½x23½ inches.<br>Other than a small
  design for a decorative vase, no painting by the great French poster and fine artist
  Berthon has come to market. This charming image featuring a young woman, likely
  a governess, amusing her delighted charges with a brightly colored marionette, was
  likely done for a department or toy store advertisement. The background contains
  a decorative pattern of shuttlecocks, a popular pastime at the turn of the century
  and further establishing the theme of play in the image.
