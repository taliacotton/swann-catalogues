TYPESET: '<p>Illustration for the poem "Dogs" by Marchette Chute, published in Sing
  a Song of Popcorn: Every Child''s Book of Poems" (New York: Scholastic Inc., 1988),
  page 68 and on cover. Watercolor and ink on paper. 190x127 mm; 7Â½x5 inches, image,
  on larger sheet. Unsigned. Tipped to matte and archivally framed. <br>The charming
  poem it accompanied read: The Dogs I know have many shapes. For some are big and
  tall, And some are long, And some are thin, And some are fat and small. And some
  are little bits of fluff and have no shape at all."</p><p>Arnold Lobel was one of
  the greatest children''s book illustrators of his generation. As gifted with words
  as pictures, he was one of a very few people to be honored by both the Newbery and
  Caldecott Committees. Although he won the Caldecott Medal for Fables (1980), he
  earned his immortality with the highly successful Frog and Toad series. "Lobel dealt
  head on with the complexities, misunderstandings, and emotional swings that define
  a true friendship," fellow illustrator Mo Willems has observed. "I can think of
  few creators who cared as much about his characters'' emotional well-being as he
  did."</p><p><a href="javascript:void(0)"><strong><br></strong></a></p>'
