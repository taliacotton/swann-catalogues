  Seldom Smiles: A Collector''s Guide to Neysa McMein by Norman I. Platnick. Published
  by Enchantment Ink, 2008.<br>Born Marjorie McMein, the artist changed her name to
  "Neysa" after moving to New York City to pursue a brief acting career. She studied
  at The School of The Art Institute of Chicago and at the Art Students League. After
  selling her first drawing to the Boston Star, McMein began illustrating covers for
  The Saturday Evening Post in 1915 where her covers featuring glamorous and fashionable
  young women quickly gained popularity and brought her many more commissions for
  the leading magazines of the day, including Collier''s, McClure''s, Liberty, and
  Woman''s Home Companion. During World War I, McMein was commissioned to create propaganda
  posters for the governments of the United States and France, as well as to design
  fundraising posters for the Red Cross and YMCA. From 1923 to 1937, she produced
  all the covers for McCall''s. She also created advertisements for leading brands
  like Lucky Strike, Palmolive, and Betty Crocker, for which she produced a portrait
  of the fictional home baker. When magazines began reducing costs by replacing expensive
  commissioned illustrations with the cheaper medium of photography, McMein pivoted
  from her commercial career and primarily painted commissioned portraits.<br>McMein
  was an ardent supporter of women''s suffrage and was known to be fiercely independent
  with an active social life, which sometimes pushed the boundaries of propriety.
  She was inducted into the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame in 1984, 35 years
  after her death.'
