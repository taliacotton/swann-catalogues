DESCRIPT: "EDWARD GOREY (1925-2000)"
CROSSHEAD: "\"Mr. Earbrass and a Knowledgeable Friend.\""
TYPESET: "Drawing based on the rear cover illustration and thus a likely study for Gorey's first published book The Unstrung Harp; or, Mr. Earbrass Writes a Novel (New York & Boston: Duell, Sloan, and Pearce/Little, Brown & Co., 1953).  Ink and graphite on paper with typed caption along bottom. Roughly 201x157 mm;  8x6Â¼ inches (slightly uneven sheet). Unsigned. <br>Authenticated by the Edward Gorey Charitable Trust.<br>An early and unusal piece by Gorey, drawn on a larger scale and different paper than usual. On the published covers, the figures, copied here, are pictured as \"Mr. Gorey, Mr. Earbrass, and a Knowledgeable Friend,\" whereas in this drawing, the \"knowlegeable friend\" is Gorey, himself. <br>The Unstrung Harp, Gorey's first published work and a fairly autobiographical one at that, was unique in that it used a printed typeface rather than hand-lettering, which would become a characteristic feature of his work. He did create hand-lettering for it when it was released in the compilation Amphigorey, 1972. As he was still developing his style, the illustrations, while reflecting the complexity he was known for, were rendered in a looser line and composition than he would hone in following books. This illustration shares those same qualities to an exaggeration where the outer edges look somewhat rushed and unfinished but still exemplifies a sure and spontaneous hand. An early and charmingly personal illustration by Gorey."
