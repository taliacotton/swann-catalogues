He danced in Poland, Russia and England, and joined ballerina Anna Pavlova's company, which brought him to the United States. By 1926, Nellé began work as a choreographer and he later became a production designer for theaters in Detroit, St. Louis, San Francisco, Hollywood, and Europe. His extraordinary art deco stage designs of the 1920s and 1930s were often compared to the costume designs of Erté.
