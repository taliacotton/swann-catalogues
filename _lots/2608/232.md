CROSSHEAD: "\"All Dogs Go to Heaven.\" Carface key multi-animation production cel Setup."
TYPESET: "Elaborate key multi-cel animation setup (with scene-matching background print) of the villain Carface from the classic Don Bluth and Gary Goldman-directed film All Dogs Go to Heaven (1989). 11½x16 inches, image, on 13½x16½-inch sheets.This is a far more complex setup than most that have come to market: it consists of 5 cel layers, including Carface, his car, translucent shadows, and the movie screen, all on separate cels over a scene-matching background print. It is remarkable that these many matching pieces have remained together, and this setup is a testament to the complexity of making animated films."
