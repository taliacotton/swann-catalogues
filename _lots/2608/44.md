DESCRIPT: "ARTHUR RACKHAM (1867-1939)"
CROSSHEAD: "\"Goblin Market endpaper design.\""
TYPESET: "Ink and graphite on paper, circa 1933. 190x280 mm; 7½x11 inches, sheet. Lower margin contains inked directive initialed by Rackham and numerous pencil indications as well as a rough thumbnail sketch of the end papers. Float mounted and framed to 15x18½. <br>A fascinating look into Rackham's creative process for his book designs. His attention to detail included the placement of the repeating silhouette pattern of the creatures and tree to appear the front and rear endpapers of the 1933 edition of Christina Rossetti's story \"Goblin Market\" published in London by Harrap in 1933.<br>Rackham's note states: \"I want the end papers to be as `all-overish' as possible = not much gap between the blocks [the word \"vertically\" struck through] and as little as can be conveniently worked in the `gutter' between the two sides. AR\"<br>The penciled notes indicate that two blocks would be used, one of a facsimile image, the other, its negative \"reversed the other way around.\" A thumbnail sketch to the right shows how the \"A B A / B A B\" pattern was to appear. To the right of the main image, Rackham also lightly sketched the reverse of the main design."
