CROSSHEAD: '"A Love by the Stars."De Beers Diamond advertisement.'
TYPESET: '<p>Created for De Beers'' "A Diamond is Forever" campaign, 1971. Acrylic
  on canvas. 914x711 mm; 36x28 inches.<br></p><p>Hane was a highly talented and prolific
  illustrator during the short span of his professional career. Though he created
  hundreds of magazine, book, and album cover designs, he is likely best known for
  the covers of the Collier-Macmillan editions of C.S. Lewis''s <em>Chronicles of
  Narnia</em> books and the surrealist covers for Carlos Castaneda''s <em>The Teachings
  of Don Juan</em> and <em>A Separate Reality</em> for Simon &amp; Schuster.<br>Created
  for De Beers'' ubiquitous "Diamonds are Forever" camapign, the painting is a gorgeous
  example of his work, generally scarce on the market. It is rendered in a rich palette,
  with moody figures and backgrounds to create a sense of mystique. The full text,
  with its very 1970s astrology vibe, read: "A love by the stars was important. Until
  the right man of the wrong sign put his star on my finger. And I entered his house
  with my love."<br>Hane was at the height of his creative powers when he died as
  a result of a mugging in Central Park, but was recognized by the artistic community
  with several posthumous awards. Philadelphia College of Art, in his home state of
  Pennsylvania, offers an annual Roger T. Hane Memorial Award to the student with
  the year''s best illustration portfolio.</p><p><a href="javascript:void(0)"><strong><br></strong></a></p>'
