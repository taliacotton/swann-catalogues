DESCRIPT: ROGER HANE (1939-1974)
CROSSHEAD: DeBeers Diamond advertisement.
TYPESET: Acrylic on canvas. 914x711 mm; 36x28 inches. <br>Hane was a highly talented
  and prolific illustrator during the short span of his professional career. Though
  he created hundreds of magazine, book, and album cover designs, he is likely best
  known for the covers of the Collier-Macmillan editions of C.S. Lewis's Chronicles
  of Narnia books and the Surrealist covers for Carlos Castaneda's The Teachings of
  Don Juan and A Separate Reality for Simon & Schuster.  This large, surrealist painting
  created for DeBeers Diamonds is a gorgeous example of his work, generally scarce
  on the market, rendered in a rich palette, with moody figures and backgrounds to
  create a sense of mystique, a fantasy world to which one could be transported. Hane
  was at the height of his creative powers when he died as a result of a mugging in
  Central Park, but was recognized by the artistic community with several posthumous
  awards and Philadelphia College of Art, in his home state of Pennsylvania, offers
  an annual Roger T. Hane Memorial Award to the student with the year's best illustration
  portfolio.
