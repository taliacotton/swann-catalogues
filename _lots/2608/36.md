  Lobel was one of the greatest children''s book illustrators of his generation. As
  gifted with words as pictures, he was one of a very few people to be honored by
  both the Newbery and Caldecott Committees. Although he won the Caldecott Medal for
  Fables (1980), he earned his immortality with the highly successful Frog and Toad
  series. "Lobel dealt head on with the complexities, misunderstandings, and emotional
  swings that define a true friendship," fellow illustrator Mo Willems has observed.
  "I can think of few creators who cared as much about his characters'' emotional
  well-being as he did."</p><p><a href="javascript:void(0)"><strong><br></strong></a></p>'
