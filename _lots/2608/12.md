TYPESET: '<p>Illustration for the story "The Brownies on Bicycles" as published in
  The Brownies: Their Book (New York: The Century, 1887), page 22. Pen and ink on
  stiff paper mounted to card. 220x197 mm; 8½x7¾ inches, image, on 11½x9½-inch mount.
  Signed "Palmer Cox" in lower right, captioned "In the work shop" with notes to printer
  on mounting card recto, verso with The Century Co. stamp.<br></p><p>A charming illustration
  from the first volume of Cox''s popular "Brownies" series. The full caption printed
  in the book reads: "Not long could door or windows stand / Fast locked before the
  Brownie band; and soon the bicycles they sought / From every room and bench were
  brought."<br></p><p>Palmer Cox''s Brownies were the Smurfs of their day. Not only
  were they the source for a long line of best-selling children''s books but their
  Canadian-born creator widely licensed them for all kinds of merchandise. Even Kodak''s
  Brownie Camera was named for them. The stories and pictures were serialized in St.
  Nicholas and Ladies'' Home Journal and adapted as Sunday comic strip. At least two
  plays were based on the popular characters. Arguably Cox drew his best pictures
  for this work, the original The Brownies, Their Book. Cox had not yet developed
  the vast cast of ethnic Brownies, but the Irishman and The Dude can be spotted among
  the predominately Scottish band of fairies in these early drawings.</p>'
