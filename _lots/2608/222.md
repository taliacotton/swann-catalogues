  <br></p><p>Gould was most famous for his Dick Tracy comic strip, which he began
  only two years after this popular but short-lived strip about a feisty young lady.
  Left as a baby on the doorstep of three male artists Barclay, Kit, and Jimmy, and
  their housekeeper, Mother Gale, Nancy was adopted, raised, and adored by them. This
  group of strips focuses on Nancy's impending twelfth birthday and her growing curiosity
  about her birth parents. A tender and very gender-role bending strip from Gould's
  early days before he became known for his hard-edged detective hero.</p>
