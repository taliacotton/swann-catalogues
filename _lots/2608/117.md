Unsigned. 310x230 mm; 12¼x9 inches, on 14¼x10½-inch sheet. The the joyful elves are seen with a birthday cake before the famed Manhattan art deco hotel, which is prominently highlighted in the image. The Empire State Building, which was still under construction at the time, appears at the left.  The body of water appears to be an imagined amalgam of Central Park Lake and the Hudson River.  This may have been used for a menu or other publication related to an event celebrating the hotel’s first anniversary (which, given the date, could have been a New Year’s party). A unique and charming piece of New York City history."
