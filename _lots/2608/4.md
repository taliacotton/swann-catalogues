DESCRIPT: LEWIS JESSE BRIDGMAN (1857-1931)
CROSSHEAD: '"Through the Looking-glass!" * "Beginning to Melt Away."'
TYPESET: "<p>Together, two illustrations from the 1893 edition of Lewis Carroll's
  Through the Looking-Glass. (New York: Crowell, 1893). Pen and ink on Bristol board.
  210x165 mm; 8¼x6½ inches, image, on 14x8-inch sheets. Lewis Jesse Bridgman copied
  Sir John Tenniel's famous wood engravings for this 1893 piracy of the Lewis Carroll
  classic. He did not slavishly copy Tenniel's drawings but added some flourishes
  of his own which differentiate his work from the originals. He later became a prolific
  illustrator under his own name. We are grateful to Arnold Hirshon and Alan Tannenbaum
  for authenticating these works.</p>"
