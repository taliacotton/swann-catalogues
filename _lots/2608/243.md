DESCRIPT: "(ANIMATION) HANNA-BARBERA STUDIOS"
CROSSHEAD: The Flintstones.  Hand-inked studio publicity cel featuring Fred, Wilma,
  Barney, and Betty.
TYPESET: "<p>Circa 1960. Image roughly 7x7 inches on 8Â½x1-inch sheet. <br>An extremely
  scarce Hanna-Barbera Flintstones publicity work dating to the run of the original
  1960s animated television series. The cel features Fred, Wilma, and the Rubbles,
  Betty and Barney, gathered around the piano in song. Cels like this were made by
  the studio ink and paint department for publicity purposes and as gifts to VIPs
  involved with the company. This delightful image was most likely designed by the
  great MGM and Hanna-Barbera artist Dick Bickenbach, and the scenario was often imitated
  in later Hanna-Barbera art releases.<br>The Flintstones holds a notable place in
  television history as the first primetime animated sitcom. It paved the way for
  The Simpsons and many other series that followed.</p>"
