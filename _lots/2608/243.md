TYPESET: "Circa 1960. Image rougly 7x7 inches on 8Â½x1-inch sheet. <br>An extremely scarce Hanna Barbera Flintstones publicity work dating to the run of the original 1960s animated television series.  The cel features Fred, Wilma, and the Rubbles, Betty and Barney, gathered around the piano in song.  Cels like this were made by the studio ink and paint department for publicity purposes and as gifts to VIPs involved with the company.  The image was most likely designed by the MGM and Hanna Barbera artist Dick Bickenbach and this scenario was often imitated in decades that followed. <br>The Flintstones holds a notable place in television history as the first primetime animated sitcom. It paved the way for The Simpsons and many other series that followed."
