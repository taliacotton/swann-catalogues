  mm; 10½x7½ inches, image, on 20x15-inch sheet. Signed " S. Vidsbergs - 1963" in
  ink, lower right image.</p><p><br>Latvian artist Sigismunds Vidbergs was encouraged
  early on by his teachers to pursue art, leading him to study at the Saint Petersburg
  Art and Industry Academy. With specialities in stained and painted glass, as well
  as graphic design, he taught art through World War I, and later returned to Latvia
  where he exhibited his own artwork. Influenced by artists such as Beardsley and
  Vallotton, Vidbergs' costume designs and erotic illustrations in particular, evoke
  the graceful, curvilinear details of Beardsley and the boldness of Vallotton's prints.
  This fasionable, whimsical poster displays Vidbergs' indelible sense of graphic
  patterns, negative space, and composition.</p><p><a href="javascript:void(0)"><strong><br></strong></a></p>
