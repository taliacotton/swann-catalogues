DESCRIPT: GERDA WEGENER (1886-1940)
CROSSHEAD: Musical harem.
TYPESET: <p>Illustration of a quintet of female musicians in an Indian palace, from
  an unknown publication. Pen and ink on paper. 90x160 mm; 3½x6¼ inches. Signed "Gerda
  Wegener" in lower right margin. Circa 1920.<br></p><p>The Danish illustrator and
  painter Gerda Wegener moved to Paris in 1912 and quickly became known for the superb
  artistry of her fashion and lifestyle illustrations and advertisements (see lots
  19 and 20) in Vogue, La Vie Parisienne, Fantasion, La Guirlande, and many other
  Parisian magazines. Her style was marked by a playful sensuality though her book
  illustrations and fine art displayed more highly erotic, mainly Sapphic themes.
  </p><p>Her personal life received scrutiny when her spouse and muse, Lili Elbe,
  also a painter, who went by the name Einer Wegener, became the first woman to undero
  gender confirmation surgery and became a critical figure in the LGBTQ community.
  Elbe stopped painting shortly thereafter and eventually died of complications after
  a fourth surgery. In 2000, a novel based loosely on their lives was published and
  turned into a feature -length film, The Danish Girl in 2015. <br></p><p>Wegener's
  work remains among the best of the Art Deco period, especially in light of her sucess
  as a female artist amid her more famous male contemporaries such as Barbier, Brunelleschi,
  Lepape, and Martin.</p>
