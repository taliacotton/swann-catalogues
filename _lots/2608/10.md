  laid into the pages. See condition report for breakdown of contents.<br>Provenance:
  The artist, by descent to daughter Nancy, who was the model for the character Sally.<br>Perhaps
  the most famous series of readers for young children, the "Dick and Jane readers,"
  was the brainchild of Scott, Foresman editors/writers William S. Gray and Zerna
  Sharp.  Developed in the 1930s, their popular primers, which used the "look-see"
  (i.e. sight-reading) method, peaked in the 1950s and taught generations of American
  school children the fundamentals of reading, writing, and verbal skills.  When the
  company sought to update the series in the late 1950s and early `60s, they worked
  with professionals in the fields of child psychology and early childhood education
  to create the texts that used modern pedagogical methods and artwork that would
  reflect contemporary props and story plots to engage beginning readers. With an
  emphasis on visual stimulation and the idea that children learn to read pictures
  before text, SFC hired Childress to create the accompanying illustrations that children
  could relate to and ideally spark their joy for reading. His wholesome, joyful imagery
  for such advertising campaigns as Wonder Bread, Campbell''s Soup, and Coca-Cola,
  among other traditional brands, made him the ideal illustrator for the series .<br>Childress
  was so enthused by the project and produced several stories between 1958 and 1968.
  He employed his entire family in the venture,  having them pose for the illustrations
  which SFC encouraged, printing all the photos he needed for his work. These photographs,
  which display his commitment to honest and realistic poses and expressions, were
  preserved by Childress and his family and are included in this archive, organized
  by the titles of the stories for which they were created. The accompanying full
  pencil roughs lay out the chapters and contain meticulous handwritten text beneath
  his perfectly composed sketches.<br>Childress'' contributions were so integral that
  the publishers would entrust him with textual edits that he suggested, some examples
  of which are marked in the proof sketchbooks. <br>This archive provides a wonderful
  and detailed look into the creative process of the illustrator who helped shape
  mid-century American education.'
