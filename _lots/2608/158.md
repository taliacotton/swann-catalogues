  copy of the score, presented to the show''s producers, Richards and Mary Lea Johnson,
  as a memento by the printers, Chelsea Music Service, Inc., and signed by six of
  its staff members. <br>With music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, direction by Harold
  Prince and an all-star cast, Sweeney Todd was a tour-de-force of Broadway talent.
  It swept the Tony Awards for 1979 winning eight Bests including Musical, Original
  Score, Actor, Actress, Direction, Best Book of a Musical, Scenic Design and Costume.
  It went on to receive an additional nine Drama Desk Awards. <br>Hirschfeld illustrated
  his first Sondheim musical in 1957 with West Side Story. Though Hirschfeld had been
  drawing the American Theatre for more than thirty years by then, he went on to record
  the next half-century of Sondheim on Broadway, off-Broadway, and in films. Hirschfeld
  captured almost all of his Broadway shows and few of the films he scripted or scored.
  Sondheim was himself a Hirschfeld collector, acquiring show drawings either directly
  from the artist or through his friends and collaborators like Hal Prince. In his
  last interview, just five days before his death, the times included a photo of Sondheim
  with an image of Hirschfeld’s Putting it Together in the background. <br>"While
  the two men were quite different, Hirschfeld would have probably agreed with Sondheim’s
  quote that ''Content Dictates Form; Less is More; God Is in the Details — all in
  the service of Clarity, without which nothing else matters.''"--from "Stephen Sondheim:
  His Career as Seen by Al Hirschfeld," Alhirschfeldfoundation.org. November, 2021.'
