CROSSHEAD: "Alice and the White Queen * Alice and the Red Queen * Red King and Queen."
TYPESET: "Together, three illustrations from the 1893 edition of Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass. (New York: Crowell, 1893).  Pen and ink on Bristol board. Alice and White Queen measures 171x152 mm; 6¾x5 inches; Alice and Red Queen measures 171x133 mm; 6¾x5¼ inches; Red King and Queen measures 133x177 mm; 5½x7 inches. All on slightly larger sheets. Unsigned. Lewis Jesse Bridgman copied Sir John Tenniel's famous wood engravings for this 1893 piracy of the Lewis Carroll classic. He did not slavishly copy Tenniel's drawings but added some flourishes of his own which differentiate his work from the originals. He later became a prolific illustrator under his own name. We are grateful to Arnold Hirschon and Alan Tannenbaum for authenticating these works."
