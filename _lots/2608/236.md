TYPESET: 'Original illustration for a possibly unrealized King Features Mickey Mouse
  calendar for 1930. Pen and ink on paper with archival backing paper. 1003x750 mm;
  39½x29½ inches. <br>Provenance: Richard Opfer Auctioneering, Inc.; Geographicus
  Rare Antique Maps. <br>This is one of eight known and twelve presumed illustrations
  by Biedermann for a large-scale King Features annual calendar. Noted Mickey Mouse
  collector and toy designer Mel Birnkrant, who owns the four others from this same
  series, notes on his website (melbirnkrant.com) that the images can be dated to
  1930, which was the year King Features licensed Mickey Mouse from Disney as a comic
  strip. Each of the scenes shows a newly-arrived Mickey and his cartoon friends in
  a different foreign city "taking on the world," as it were.<br> Biedermann was a
  prolific artist on the staff of Joseph Pulitzer''s and William Randolph Hearst''s
  syndicated newspapers, and illustrated many of their numerous book, magazine, and
  calendar publications. His crowd scenes and views from a bird''s eye perspective,
  like this image, became his trademark. In 1926, he co-created the book All The Funny
  Folks for which he made detailed drawings featuring dozens of famous comic characters
  by other cartoonists. The success of the book led to a commission by King Features
  Syndicate to illustrate annual calendars with the complete roster of the company''s
  comic strip characters. <br>Here, along with Biedermann''s giant-eared Mickey, we
  see a giant alligator, Felix the Cat, and Grace Drayton''s Dolly Dimples and Pussycat
  Princess among other famous faces. <br>A fascinating example of Biedermann''s work
  and among the earliest artworks related to the Mickey Mouse comic strip. The whereabouts
  of the remaining four illustrations is unknown.'
