  on paper. 145x116 mm; 5¾x4½ inches, mounted to 7x6-inch stiff card. Tipped to window

  owner.<br>This is the beautiful original watercolor illustration given to Leighton
  Brothers engravers to translate into the color lithographs used in the first edition
  of the book. <br>As a descendant of the Duke of Ancaster, Eleanor Vere Boyle was
  a member of the British peerage and an amateur painter and children''s book illustrator.
  As her family looked askance at any one of her class or sex participating in the
  arts, she signed her work "EVB" and so worked within relative obscurity. Her husband
  was the son of the Earl of Cork. She specialized in elaborate Pre-Raphaelitesque
  watercolors for fairy tales. One of her most accomplished works was Friedrich Wilhelm
  Carové''s The Story Without an End (1868), translated from the German by Sarah Austin.</p>'
