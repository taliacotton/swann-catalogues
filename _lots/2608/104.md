  artists.</p><p>Troy Kinney was an illustrator, painter, etcher, and print maker/graphic
  artist from Kansas City, Missouri. Kinney married Margaret West, who was also an
  artist. They collaborated so often that people referred to them jointly as "the
  Kinneys." They created illustrations for several books and covers for <em>Harper's
  Bazaar</em> magazine as well as fine art paintings, many of which focused on dance,
  as in this canvas. In 1910, a book publisher sent the couple to Spain to make a
  set of illustrations for the first English translation of the book <em>Blood and
  Sand.</em> While in Spain, Kinney became fascinated with Spanish dancing and spent
  several years studying it. In 1914 he wrote a book on the subject titled <em>The
  Dance, Its Place in Art and Life.</em></p><p><a href="javascript:void(0)"><strong><br></strong></a></p>
