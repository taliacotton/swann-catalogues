TYPESET: 'Original illustration for a possibly unrealized Mickey Mouse calendar for
  1930. Pen and ink on paper with archival backing paper. 1003x750 mm; 39½x29½ inches.
  <br>Provenance: Richard Opfer Auctioneering, Inc.; Geographicus Rare Antique Maps.
  <br>This is one of eight known and twelve presumed illustrations by Biedermann for
  a large-scale King Features annual calendar. Noted Mickey Mouse collector and toy
  designer Mel Birnkrant, who owns the four others from this same series, notes on
  his website (melbirnkrant.com) that the images can be dated to 1930, which was the
  year King Features licensed Mickey Mouse from Disney as a comic strip. Each of the
  scenes shows a newly-arrived Mickey and his cartoon friends in a different foreign
  city "taking on the world," as it were.<br> Biedermann was a prolific artist on
  the staff of Joseph Pulitzer''s and William Randolph Hearst''s syndicated newspapers,
  and illustrated many of their numerous book, magazine, and calendar publications.
  His crowd scenes and views from a bird''s eye perspective, like this image, became
  his trademark. In 1926, he co-created the book All The Funny Folks for which he
  made detailed drawings featuring dozens of famous comic characters by other cartoonists.
  The success of the book led to a commission by King Features Syndicate to illustrate
  annual calendars with the complete roster of the company''s comic strip characters.
  <br>Here, along with Biedermann''s giant-eared Mickey, we see Felix the Cat, Bonzo
  the Dog, Jiggs and Maggie, and Dumb Dora, among other famous faces. <br>A fascinating
  example of Biedermann''s work and among the earliest artworks related to the Mickey
  Mouse comic strip. The whereabouts of the remaining four illustrations is unknown.'
