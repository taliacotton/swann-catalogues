  Estate; Private collection, New York.</p><p>Arnold Lobel was one of the greatest
  children''s book illustrators of his generation. As gifted with words as pictures,
  he was one of a very few people to be honored by both the Newbery and Caldecott
  Committees. Although he won the Caldecott Medal for Fables (1980), he earned his
  immortality with the highly successful Frog and Toad series. "Lobel dealt head on
  with the complexities, misunderstandings, and emotional swings that define a true
  friendship," fellow illustrator Mo Willems has observed. "I can think of few creators
  who cared as much about his characters'' emotional well-being as he did."</p><p><a
