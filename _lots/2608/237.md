TYPESET: '<p>Studio-issued photostat of sequence 4.5.  367x445 mm; 14½x17½ inches,
  sheet. Artist''s sign-off stamp signed "04.5 Dick Anthony / J.C.J." and signed "Anthony"

  &lt;br&gt;Provenance: "One-of-a-Kind" Cartoon Art, Decatur, GA. (with their COA);
  current owner, private collection New York.</p><p>This photostat in its original
  presentation matte was apparently made for review by the studio staff; it is very
  likely that this scene was left out of the final film due to its risqué visuals.</p><p>The
  reverse of the backing board bears a rarely seen production-specific stamp for the
  “Concert Feature” (the working title for Fantasia), with the sequence number 4.5,
  name of the artist Dick Anthony, and the initials J.C.J.</p><p>Dick Anthony was
  responsible for many lovely background paintings on The Pastoral Symphony sequence.
  The great Disney, Fleischer and Mintz artist, Dick Huemer (who was a story director
  on Fantasia), spoke highly of Dick Anthony’s talent, saying in a 1968 interview
  that he was ”A crackerjack background and matte artist.”</p><p>While not original
  art, this is a very scarce image and a fantastic relic of “forbidden” Disney history.</p>'
