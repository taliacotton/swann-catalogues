FOOTNOTE: The North Carolina poet and publisher Jonathan Williams is best known for
  turning bits of Appalachian vernacular "found language" into avant-garde poetry,
  and as the founder of the prestigious small press, The Jargon Society. <br><br>Offered
  here is the witty correspondence of Williams with a friend. He notes that the poet
  Joel Oppenheimer recently visited North Carolina and "was nearly run out on a rail
  for using the word cunt in public--not once but many times. Ah well, I don't use
  that word but I fear I use all the others, when the fit is on me." Recounting his
  recent interview in Gay Sunshine magazine, he notes "Mercy on us--there wasn't much
  left to tell. Which spares us from such chores for awhile, I hope." He jokes that
  "You never know about kids--that's why I never consider anyone below 22, when the
  brain has had some time to materialize. It's no trick to look groovy at 17, but,
  so what?"<br><br>Also included are 6 blank postcards issued by the Jargon Society
  (numbers 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, and 14), most featuring text by Williams and one featuring
  his image (captioned "Jonathan Williams, en route to the Birthplace of Dizzy Gillespie").
