CROSSHEAD: "\"Home - Secured.\""
year: "1982"
TYPESET: "Colored pencil on paper. 248x315 mm; 9¾x12½ inches, image, on 12¼x14½-inch sheet. Signed \"Tom-82\" in lower right margin. 1982.<br><br>Tom of Finland Foundation catalogue number 82.01. <br><br>Provenance: The artist, by private commission to Denis Morin, 1982. <br><br>Published: Dian Hanson, <i>Tom of Finland XXL,</i> Cologne: Taschen, 2009; 2021, page 504.  <br><br>An exceptional color work by Tom of Finland. In a clever homage to the recipient, a good friend and resident Canadian, the breeches and boots of the soldiers are those of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. It is also the only major color work to feature brown boots as opposed to his usual black. <br><br>Tom of Finland (born Touko Laaksonen) pioneered a new freedom and aesthetic in gay erotic art. Coming of age in a time and place of extreme censorship, he was inspired by the \"beefcake\" photographs that were primarily distributed through body building magazines of the 1940s and `50s to create a visual language for gay men that was hyper-masculine and, over time, increasingly graphic, depicting the wildest sexual fantasies. Always instilled with a playfulness and joyful involvement of the participants, they also toyed with rebellion and put sex, politics, history, and aesthetics on a level playing field. His work became an inspiration for generations of artists to find their own voice and expression. His drawings, photographs, and collages can be found in several important collections and museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, among others."
