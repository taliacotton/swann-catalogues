FOOTNOTE: The Athletic Model Guide was established by Bob Mizer in 1945. Mizer's imagery
  evolved from men in classically inspired bodybuilder poses, to pairs wrestling or
  in other tableaux, to men in small posing straps or otherwise covered, to full nudity.
  Mizer photographed thousands of models and created tens of thousands of images.
  He used his quarterly publication Physique Pictorial to advertise this imagery,
  which was available as photographic prints.
