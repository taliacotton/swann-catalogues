FOOTNOTE: "Third World Gay Revolution spun off from the Gay Liberation Front in July 1970, in reaction to both racism in the Gay Power movement and homophobia in the Black Power movement. They remained active as a separate organization for only a few months. One of these holiday cards reads \"Celebrate\" on the outside, and opens to a lavender image of the word \"Gay \" in the shape of a hand grenade. The other shows a Christmas tree with \"Joy to the World\" on the outside. Inside, a trail of gunpowder and weapons leads to the tree, under the header \"The Gay Revolution Has Come.\" <br><br>Provenance: From the collection of author Owen Levy."
