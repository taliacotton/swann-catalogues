FOOTNOTE: "Third World Gay Revolution spun off from the Gay Liberation Front in July
  1970, in reaction to both racism in the Gay Power movement and homophobia in the
  Black Power movement. They remained active as a separate organization for only a
  few months. \n\nOne of these holiday cards reads \"Celebrate\" on the outside, and
  opens to a lavender image of the word \"Gay \" in the shape of a hand grenade. The
  other shows a Christmas tree with \"Joy to the World\" on the outside. Inside, a
  trail of gunpowder and weapons leads to the tree, under the header \"The Gay Revolution
  Has Come.\" "
