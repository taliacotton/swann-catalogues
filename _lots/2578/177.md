FOOTNOTE: "In the early 1980s Doug Ischar set out to document the men and culture of the Belmont Rocks of Chicago, one of the most visibly gay beaches in North America at the time. He says of the project, \"I was fearful AIDS would obliterate queer culture. I had this fervid conservationist mission.\" This image from the project intimately depicts two sun-bathed men embracing on the rocks, an idyllic portrayal of The Belmont Rocks which were removed in 2003."
