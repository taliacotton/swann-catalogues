  <br><br><em>Redding, a commercial graphic designer and painter, spent time in the
  late 1970s designing postcards, as their smaller format was much easier to work
  with than paintings in his New York City apartment. In the early 2000s Redding founded
  the Queer Men’s Erotic Art Workshop which held live, nude drawing classes at the
  Leslie Lohman Museum.</em></p>
