The image was first used on a poster to 'recruit people for the first Gay Pride march in June 1970 on the first anniversary of the Stonewall Riots' (ibid.) Hujar's image was then used by the Gay Liberation Front, with Su Negrin combining the photograph with a mandala bearing the words \"Let Go,\" (designed by Suzanne Bevier). The resulting poster in \"red-orange and purple on soft gold\" was offered for sale through the pages of Come Out! for one dollar (volume 1, issue 7 Dec-Jan 1970, p. 2)."
