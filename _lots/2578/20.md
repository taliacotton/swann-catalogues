DESCRIPT: "(CROSS DRESSING)"
CROSSHEAD: A rare album with more than 150 exceptional photographs, all featuring
  highly stylized and elegant men cross dressing.
year: 1930
TYPESET: "<p>Album containing over 150 silver prints, the images measuring from 114.3x76.2
  to 266.7x165.1 mm; 4½x3 to 10½x6½ inches, mounted recto/verso to album pages, many
  pages with dates, in ink, below the images. 4to, green leatherette, edges lightly
  worn. 1930-41. </p><p></p><p><em>The album primarily features a male couple, who
  are dressed in exquisite outfits, including evening gowns with elaborate accessories,
  a wedding gown (including a marriage scene with one figure in a suit), and fanciful
  costumes, and are posing in front of cleverly designed backdrops (such as shimmering
  hanging textiles, artfully arranged corners of rooms, and a screen decorated in
  stars). The album features a number of sittings and combinations of figures, hinting
  at the both the delight and seriousness with which each tableaux was designed and
  executed. The resulting photographs are well composed and printed. </em></p><p>Both
  the scope and early date of this album add to its rarity--our research has not uncovered
  an early body of work that similarly documents a committed investigation of form
  and identity. </p>"
