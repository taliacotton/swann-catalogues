  artist''s stamp on verso. 1995. <br><br>"<em>Stuck Rubber Baby", which celebrated
  its 25th anniversary in 2020, was Cruse''s best-known work. The groundbreaking graphic
  novel chronicled his coming of age and coming out in Jim Crow, pre-Stonewall 1960s
  Birmingham, Alabama. The story follows lead character, Toland, who is closeted,
  scared, and aware of the corruption and discrimination around him. It is only when
  he meets Ginger Raines, who introduces him to civil rights activists and people
  who embrace their authentic selves despite equally conformist and hostile environments,
  that he is emboldened enough to do the same. Stuck Rubber Baby was the winner of
  Eisner and Harvey Awards in the U.S. and (in translation), a Comics Critics Award
  in Spain, a Luchs Award in Germany, and a Prix de la critique at the International
  Comics Festival in Angoulême, France. </em><br><br>Provenance: The Estate of Howard
