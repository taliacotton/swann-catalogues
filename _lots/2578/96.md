  long and prolific career in fashion and performing arts began in the 1950s where,
  after serving in the Italian Campaign in World War II and completing studies at
  The Art Students League on the GI Bill, he was launched into the fashion world as
  the head illustrator for The New York Herald Tribune under Eugenia Sheppard. Soon
  to follow were positions at The London Sunday Times, American Vogue, The New York
  Times, and Italian Harper''s Bazaar where he famously covered Yves Saint Laurent''s
  first and last collections (1958 and 2002). However, it is as Halston''s Creative
  Director throughout the 1970s that he is best remembered. That time was recently
  chronicled in the popular Netflix series "Halston" in which Eula is skillfully portrayed
  by actor David Pittu.</em></p>'
