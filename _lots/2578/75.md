FOOTNOTE: "The Colt Studio Group was founded in New York in 1967, and built its reputation on the photography of founder Jim French (1932-2017), aka \"Rip Colt.\" They originated in New York, soon moved to the Los Angeles area, and have been based in San Francisco since 2003. \n\nOffered here is a large collection of material issued by Colt. The earliest is a packet of ten black and white photographs of a single model, 177x127 mm; 7x5 inches, in a plain brown mailing envelope postmarked from New York on 2 August 1972. The mailing label has a horse's head and the studio's New York post office box. This predates the 1973 Miller v. California Supreme Court decision which clarified the legal status of pornographic material being sent through the mail. \n\nAlso included is a large collection of Colt material which was meticulously collected and preserved from 1992 to 2007. This includes: \n\n16 \"photo sets\" produced between 1992 and 1999. Each one is a packet of photographs, 177x127 mm; 7x5 inches, devoted to a single model, in a sleeve printed with a copyright notice and catalog number. The model's name and receipt date are often added in manuscript by the recipient. Most are black and white photographs in sets of 10. \n\nA compact disc of photographs of model Steve Kelso, thought to be the first Colt product issued in this format. \n\nSigned and inscribed copy of \"Masc., the Color Photography of Jim French,\" 1995. \n\n35th Anniversary Album in two parts. \n\n6 different Colt Calendars for 2005. \n\n9 magazine-format publications, including Colt Men (#35, 36, 40), The Best Colt Men (#7), and Colt Studios Presents (#12, 15, 18, 20, and 21). \n\nA large quantity of advertising ephemera and mailers arranged in envelopes by year of collection from 1998 to 2007, with approximately 100 items in total."
