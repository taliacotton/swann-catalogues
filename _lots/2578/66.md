FOOTNOTE: "18 October 1969: \". . . My agent in Roma said if there was nothing pressing . . . in Hollywood I should stay here because I am well known, and so many more films are being made here. So here I am. The job scene in Hollywood is very bad. . . . And I really can't face doing another stupid special guest star piece of crap on T.V. I've had it! I have not done one decent thing since I went out there. . . .\n\n\"I think at this time in my life nothing could be better than to get out of that rat race. I feel I can work here . . . . Also the film I made here with Vi[s]conti is an all time Italian classic, and is shown every year. So even the kids know me.\n\n\"I would love to work again on the stage, but where's the play?\n\n\". . . I am taking Italian lessons like mad, and loving them. It really is a very beautiful place. . . .\""
