TYPESET: "21 black-and-white illustrations. 4to, stapled illustrated wrappers. Half-titled printed with \"First Publication, March 1976.\" Near fine.<br><br>REX is an American artist and illustrator closely associated with homosexual fetish and S&M subculture art of 1970s and 1980s New York and San Francisco. His graphic work for famous gay nightclubs like Mineshaft and The Saint, and sex shops such as The Pleasure Chest and The Trading Post, as well as his calendar, magazine, and poster illustrations led to his increasingly widespread popularity, influencing emerging artists including Robert Mapplethorpe. REX published three of these bound portfolios of Männespielen before creating a series of eight unbound portfolios which are now quite rare."
