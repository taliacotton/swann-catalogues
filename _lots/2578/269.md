FOOTNOTE: "Acquired directly from the Artist.<br><br>The self-portrait was created during Sepuya's residency at the Studio Museum of Harlem as part of a series of photographs entitled \"Studio Work.\" The body of work explores the physicality of the studio and the presence of his friends and self in that space, a theme that continues in his artistic practice today. Known as a postmodern portrait photographer, Sepuya challenges traditional portraiture by filtering it through the black queer gaze."
