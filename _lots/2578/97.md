FOOTNOTE: "Eula designed posters for this seminal New York club and discotheque, including the figure which became the venue's defacto logo, half woman half cheetah. An image which appeared on club ashtray's and as the cover of an album featuring the house bands (The Esquires, Mike St. Shaw & The Prophets, and The Thunder Frog Ensemble) doing popular cover songs. Originally opened in 1966 on Broadway and 53rd street in the building which had been home to the famous Arcadia Ballroom. In 1968 it moved to a new location which would account for this poster.
