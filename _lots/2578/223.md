FOOTNOTE: Stanley Stellar has been documenting queer life and the visual culture of
  men in New York City since the 1969 Stonewall Riots. He says of his work and inspiration,
  "At that time, there was almost no meaningful recorded imagery of us, or the physical
  culture and style of who men are, here in my New York City world. I was moved to
  record it for myself, and for all of us."
