DESCRIPT: GEORGE QUAINTANCE (1902-1957)
CROSSHEAD: Female Nude.
year: 1940
TYPESET: "<p>Oil on canvas. 1940. 610x760 mm; 24x30 inches. Signed and dated in oil,
  lower left recto. 1940.<br><br>Provenance: estate of Ray Blanco, New Jersey; private
  collection, New Jersey.<br><br><em>Quaintance was one of the early American pioneers
  of kitchsy, homoerotic, fantasy art. His illustrations for Physique Pictorial magazine
  in the early 1950s helped to popularize his work. He is most sought after for his
  macho, campy, muscular images of cowboys, gods, matadors and other overtly masculine,
  skimpily-clad, idealized physical specimens. But he was also an accomplished portrait
  painter and landscapist. Outside of his portraiture, there are few known images
  of women in his ouevre.</em></p>"
