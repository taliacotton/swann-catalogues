FOOTNOTE: "The Satyrs Motorcycle Club was founded in 1954, and is believed to be not only the oldest gay motorcycle club in the United States, but also the oldest continuously operating gay organization of any kind. Based in Los Angeles, the traditional highlight of the year has been a Labor Day gathering at Badger Flat Campground in Sierra State Park, northeast of Fresno. This group includes programs for the annual Labor Day runs for 1978, 1979, 1982, 1983, 1986, 1988 through 1996, plus the program for a 1989 Thanksgiving run. The programs are filled with member lists, rules for annual riding contests, menus, reflections on the club's history, and no shortage of bawdy humor."
