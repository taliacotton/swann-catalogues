  and resourceful tactics. One of their first widely disrupted xeroxed posters created
  in 1991 reads "I AM A / lezzie / butch / pervert / girlfriend / bulldagger / sister
  / dyke / AND PROUD!" It is a phrase that has been re-worked and restated by the
  collective time and again and is central to its messaging. fierce pussy's highly
  political work questions heteronormality and highlights societal homophobia.
