FOOTNOTE: "fierce pussy began as a queer female artist collective operating out of photographer Zoe Leonard's East Village apartment. With an anti-capitalistic spirit, fierce pussy focuses on having the lesbian experience seen and heard using simple and resourceful tactics. One of their first widely disrupted xeroxed posters created in 1991 reads \"I AM A / lezzie / butch / pervert / girlfriend / bulldagger / sister / dyke / AND PROUD!\" It is a phrase that has been re-worked and restated by the collective time and again and is central to its messaging. fierce pussy's highly political work questions heteronormality and highlights societal homophobia."
