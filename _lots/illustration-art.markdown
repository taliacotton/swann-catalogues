    Keats won the Caldecott Medal in 1963 for _The Snowy Day_, the groundbreaking classic that is credited for introducing multiculturalism to mainstream children’s literature and the first picture book with an African American protagonist to win a major children’s award.

    For Keats, who grew up in a tenement in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn in the 1920s, drawing was his salvation and the means for his acceptance by others. After illustrating other writers’ works for several years, he set out to create his own stories in an urban setting. _The Snowy Day’s_ Peter would be a black child in his own voice and not “a white kid colored brown…\[and\] not through the benevolence of white children or anyone else.”

    Despite criticism about its “tokenism” and its being written by a white Jewish man who falsely represented (or ignored) African-American culture, the book overcame these accusations and was embraced by generations of young readers who could identify with a boy whose skin color resembled theirs and, more universally, of an adventure every child could relate to. In addition to its hero, the book was also groundbreaking in its use of mixed media illustration techniques of collaged decorative papers, fabric, stamps, and cloth; a method Keats would employ in future books.
