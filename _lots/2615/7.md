FOOTNOTE: "D-Q University in Davis, California was one of the first six tribal colleges and universities in the United States, remaining in operation from 1971 to 2005. This poster advertises a Sun Dance to be led by Oglala Sioux medicine man Leonard Crow Dog (1942-2021), spiritual leader of the American Indian Movement, which would be the \"first time in history on the West Coast.\" However, he had been sentenced to federal prison in 1975 for his role in the Wounded Knee incident, and would not be released on parole until March 1977. Leonard Crow Dog was the great-grandson of the Sioux leader Crow Dog (1833-1912) featured in lot 3. <br><br>Mounted on the other side of the board are three other period pieces from circa 1976: a \"Boycott Coors\" bumper sticker, an official-looking Bicentennial \"200 Years of Freedom\" bumper sticker emblazoned with the vulgar Spanish term \"puro pedo\"; and a poster by the California Institution for Men Prison Preventers: \"Prison Has Something for Every Body,\" with the name of a student contact inked below.
