at-a-glance: "Philadelphia: Morgan & Yeager / William Charles, 1815 [but circa 1832]"
FOOTNOTE: "The first of several American editions of this tale was published in 1793. A William Charles edition was published in 1815, and then the remainders were sold to the short-lived firm of Morgan & Yeager and their Juvenile Bookstore, who kept the 1815 Charles title page but added their own undated printed wrappers. Other Morgan & Yeager imprints bearing dates are from 1824 and 1825. To make this a bit more complex, the wrappers are backed with a piece of waste paper. It proves to be page 253 of Volume III of the Journal of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, issued in 1832, so we assume the wrapper was produced on or after that date. We trace no other examples of this re-issue of John Gilpin. Rosenbach 517; Welch 245.5 (both 1815 issue). "
