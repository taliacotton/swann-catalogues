FOOTNOTE: "This pass was printed in the field during the early part of the Maryland Campaign. On 11 September 1862, Major General Jackson took temporary possession of Martinsburg, WV, where this form was printed on a scrap of blue lined \"necessity paper.\" On 15 September, Jackson completed his capture of Harpers Ferry, WV. On 16 September, as his main forces rushed east to join Lee at Antietam, this pass was issued: \"Office of the Provost Marshal . . . . The Guards and Pickets will pass E. & J. White & wagon on Winchester Road. By order of Maj. Gen. Jackson, Capt. R.T. Colston, Provost Marshal.\" The next day, Jackson and his troops took the field in the bloodiest day of fighting in American history. <br><br>Confederate field passes are scarce; we have traced no other examples of this form. Published in Muller, War Papers of the Confederacy, page 5. "
