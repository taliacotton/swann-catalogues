FOOTNOTE: "Charles Augustus Dean (1844-1921) was an 8th Vermont Infantry Civil War veteran from Shrewsbury, MA who moved in 1864 to Cincinnati, where he worked as a factory hand and traveling salesman for the paper bag manufacturers Nixon, Chatfield & Woods. These letters were written to a hometown friend, and offer a good taste of Cincinnati life and politics during and after the last months of the Civil War. On 25 September 1864 he wrote \"There was a great McClellan meeting here last Monday eve and last night a Lincoln meeting, great fireworks and processions at both. I went to the one last night.\" On 6 November 1864 after the Battle of Cedar Creek, he reports on their late regiment's hardships: \"Our reg't, the 8th Vermont, was badly cut up in the late fights, 165 lost, Reed lost his leg. . . . I hope that Old Abe will call for 500,000 more men as soon as he is re-elected and end the war immediately.\" On 11 November he reported on the election: \"Old Abe is all right now, and some say 4 yrs more of war.\" On 11 December he describes a bet whether Grant takes Richmond before New Years. On 26 February 1865 he wrote \"One of the principal newspaper offices was burned out this morning, the Cin. Enquirer, a Copperhead sheet, and a great many were verry glad of it. It was but just across the street from my room here on Walnut and it made me arise verry early, I tell you, for Sunday.\" <br><br>The post-war letters sometimes discuss the local political climate. On 25 May 1868 he wrote that in \"this rebel town . . . I am mum on my political standing and say very little to my customers here about negro suffrage and the impeachment.\" His 1 May 1870 letter notes \"you ought to see the style of colored Fifteenth Amendment which just passed. How much we like them now they can vote. I propose to give them something so as to be elected to furnish paper to their public printing. Republicans & Democrats are soft shoeing them for votes.\" <br><br>As a commercial traveler, Dean often described other cities near Cincinnati. On 18 April 1869 he describes a visit to Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, and encloses \"a small sample of gypsum which I procured from a point nine miles from the mouth of the cave.\" On 11 August 1869, he describes a visit to Niagara Falls at length. Dean later returned to Massachusetts and became a successful bag manufacturer on his own account. <br><br>WITH--a folder regarding Walker's work with the New England Milk Producers Union, 1884-1889."
