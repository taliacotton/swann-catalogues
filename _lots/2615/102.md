Putnam in 1861. Some of the letters have interesting Civil War content. Her cousin L.B. Sprague of the 138th New York Infantry wrote in December 1862 while a patient at Douglas Hospital in Washington, the Union's most elegant hospital, located in the fashionable Minnesota Row townhouse once owned by Stephen Douglas. A cousin named Annie wrote from Medina, NY in April 1865 to describe the local memorial arrangements for President Lincoln in church, with \"a photograph of Lincoln draped with crepe and a large crepe bow . . . It looked so mournful I could hardly help weeping.\" <br><br>In 1866, a sister-in-law named Bess wrote from her new home in frontier Gillford, MN: \"Here I am in our own little cabin. We have been keeping house one week. . . . I have never worked so hard in my life as I did this summer, but it's for ourselves.\" "
