FOOTNOTE: "This volume documents the work of a stud horse named Traveler owned by a member of the famed Gardiner family of New York. Traveler's owner John Griswold Gardiner (1812-1861) was the Ninth Proprietor of Gardiner's Island, a small island off the eastern tip of Long Island which has been in possession of the Gardiner family from 1639 through today. <br><br>These records were kept by Abraham Baker Dayton (1820-1898), who in later years worked as a carpenter in East Hampton, NY. He began keeping the horse on 30 April 1839, charging \"2 dollars a leap, 4 dollars the season, 6 dollars to warrant.\" Traveler saw 31 mares through 11 June before he \"went on the island\" (presumably Gardiner's Island) for the season. The owners of each mare are named, along with the coloration of the mare, and amount paid. Against this are small costs deducted by Baker for a halter, shoeing and other expenses. Traveler returned to Dayton's care for the spring of 1840, with an additional option of 8 dollars for a guaranteed living colt. He saw 57 mares before he once again \"went on the island.\" On the final page, in February 1841 John G. Gardiner (the Proprietor) signs for $23 paid for the season by Jeremiah Dayton (1783-1867), Abraham's father. "
