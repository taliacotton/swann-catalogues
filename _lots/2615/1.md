FOOTNOTE: 'First edition, first issue. After creating his most important paintings
  in the American West in the early 1830s, Catlin had been giving public lectures
  on his paintings in Great Britain from 1841 onward, sometimes with a group of American
  Indians in what was essentially one of the first Wild West shows. For this seminal
  portfolio of large-format lithographs, he selected what he felt were the 25 most
  popular images from his shows. "In The North American Indian Portfolio, Catlin immortalized
  those scenes that would become forever associated with life on the Great Plains--buffalo,
  buffalo hunting, galloping horses, bronco riding, and roping"--Reddin, Wild West
  Shows, page 43. <br><br>Catlin first issued these 25 plates with printed captions
  bound with the 20 pages of introductory text. Later issues put out by Bohn or Chatto
  & Windus were variously either mounted on card without captions, or had six extra
  plates, or had only 16 pages of text. A lovely, well-preserved copy. Abbey Travel
