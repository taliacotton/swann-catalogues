FOOTNOTE: "Most of this album depicts the idyllic life of a peacetime sailor stationed in Hawaii, enjoying the beach, the palm trees, and the local tourist sights. In the rear are 7 pages of uncaptioned photos depicting the carnage of Pearl Harbor. Souvenir shots of the U.S.S. Houston, Chicago, Argonne, and Maryland are juxtaposed with 19 snapshots of explosions and corpses, each 2Â¾ x 4 inches. 3 are distant views of buildings and ships with smoke rising. One simply shows the spatter of blood on a ship's deck. Another shows a dismembered hand. 14 other snapshots show corpses of soldiers. We have found no evidence that any of them were published. <br><br>The album is signed on the cover \"Lindley, E.A. E.M. 3/6 1938 U.S.S. Argonne.\" The compiler was apparently Edward Arthur Lindley (1916-1980) of Connecticut, who had enlisted in the Navy by 1935. "
