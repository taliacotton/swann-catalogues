He began the war as a captain in an Iowa regiment, and quickly ascended through the officer ranks. He was awarded a Medal of Honor and a promotion to Brigadier General for his work at the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas. As commander of two brigades, he soon distinguished himself in three Arkansas battles, the small Battle at McGuire's Store, the Battle of Pea Ridge, and the 28 December 1862 Battle of Van Buren. Three days after Van Buren, on New Year's Day, he had these cards printed: \"Maguire's! Prairie Grove! Van Buren! Compliments of Brig. Gen. F.J. Herron and Staff,\" naming six of his staff officers.
