FOOTNOTE: 'Issued four years before the famous Stone facsimile was the Binns Declaration,
  in which the text is rendered calligraphically, the signatures are presented in
  facsimile but rearranged to fit the oval, and the ornamental border (engraved by
  George Bridport) shows portraits of Hancock, Washington, and Jefferson along with
  the seals of the original states. A statement of authenticity by Secretary of State
  John Quincy Adams bears his own facsimile signature. Binns was the first to announce
  a facsimile project, though he was beaten to the press by rival Benjamin Owen Tyler.
