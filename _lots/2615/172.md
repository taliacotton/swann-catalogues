FOOTNOTE: "Transcontinental telegraph lines had not yet reached Chile, so word of the assassination did not reach American envoy Thomas Henry Nelson for several weeks. He was in Valparaiso when a steamer arrived in port bearing the news. Here he explains the scene to a friend: \"We are all overwhelmed with grief. I can scarcely yet grasp or realize it. It comes to me with all the force of a personal loss. . . . The whole city is clad in mourning. . . . Strong men wandered about the streets weeping like children, and foreigners, unable even to speak our language, manifested a grief almost as deep as our own. . . . Several, overcome by their emotion, sat down upon the ground and wept like children. . . . The name and fame of Lincoln belong not alone to us, but to mankind, and will grow brighter and greater with the coming centuries.\" "
