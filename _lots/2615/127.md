FOOTNOTE: "Includes a long report from Frederica, GA on an early series of skirmishes in what became known as the War of Jenkins' Ear. It starts with a 13 November 1739 Spanish attack on two English settlers on Amelia Island (just north of today's Jacksonville, FL), in which the Spanish \"cut off and carried away the two Highland Men's Heads, and cut and mangled their Bodies in a most barbarous Manner.\" The British sent reinforcements to Amelia from Cumberland Island (just over the line into today's Georgia). On the 17th, General Oglethorpe led four rowboats south from Frederica, GA to confront the Spanish, chasing them about for 16 miles across Amelia Island, but the Spanish managed to escape. The final rumor was of a large body of Spanish troops massed at the St. John's River in Florida. <br><br>We find no pre-1750 issues of the Boston Weekly News-Letter at auction since 1974. "
