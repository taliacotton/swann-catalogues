at-a-glance: "New York: Sinclair Tousey, 24 July 1863"
FOOTNOTE: "Issued two weeks after the New York draft riots, this broadside urges restraint, repeating its title refrain six times. \"Workingmen! When any man asks you to break the law, and tries to stir up your passions, while he skulks out of sight, you may set him down as your worst enemy. Spurn him as you would a viper. The patriotic Workingmen of the North cannot afford to spend time killing each other. Be wise, and above all things, Don't Unchain the Tiger!\" The broadside is signed by \"A Democratic Workingman\" to appeal to the generally Lincoln-hating rioters and their sympathizers, but it was issued by Republican publisher Sinclair Tousey. This is probably the first of two known editions, presumably coming before the undated version issued by the \"N.Y. Workingmen's Democratic Republican Association.\" Streeter sale, II:1284. Provenance: collection of the noted collector and bibliographer Col. Richard Gimbel. "
