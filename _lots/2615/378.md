FOOTNOTE: "At the outset of the war with the United States, disgraced former president Santa Anna was living in exile in Cuba. After the Mexicans were defeated at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma in May 1846, the American troops crossed the Rio Grande into Mexican territory. Santa Anna used this emergency to regain the trust of the Mexican government, and returned to Mexico on 6 August to lead the military defense. This message to his fellow citizens announced his return, and attempted to inspire a patriotic resistance to the American incursion. Not in Palau. None of this printing in OCLC, although single examples are recorded by two other printers."
