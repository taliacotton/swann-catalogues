FOOTNOTE: "This letter was drafted by soon-to-be Confederate colonel Charles B. Tebbs Jr. to longtime Virginia House of Delegates member Charles Burgess Ball (1822-1883). Just a couple of weeks before Virginia's Secession Convention, Tebbs writes \"I wish you could be in the Convention. The present disastrous condition of things has arisen from exactly such conduct as yours. Our halls of legislation, state & national, north & south, contain many, indeed are full of demagogues & imbeciles, & why? Because good & true & competent men, disgusted, have given up to them, shrunk from the conflict with such creatures. . . . Va has nothing to do, but decide between cotton & Yankees.\" <br><br>WITH--3 political letters from Charles Burgess Ball to Tebbs, discussing Virginia politics, Kansas, the filibuster leader General William Walker, and Edward Everett's famous series of lectures on George Washington. Richmond, VA, 1857-1858. "
