FOOTNOTE: "Just months before the outbreak of open rebellion in Texas, Governor Viesca, forwards a decree by Mexico's Minister of the Interior, José María Gutiérrez de Estrada. The minister noted that a 7 April order by the Texas legislature, allowing the governor to call out the local militia to maintain the peace, was in conflict with a 31 March federal decree. He concludes (in translation) that the government \"cannot allow partial measures to subsist that conflict directly with the general laws. . . . It will be the responsibility of Your Excellency for the lack of compliance with what was agreed by the Congress if your government insists on upholding the aforementioned article.\" <br><br>The manuscript additions show that this copy was sent by Angel Navarro, the political head of San Antonio de Bexar, to his counterpart in Goliad. Streeter, Texas 838 (calling for a second blank leaf not found here). 2 in OCLC, and no other examples traced at auction. "
