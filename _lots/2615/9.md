FOOTNOTE: "The Pennsylvania Gazette was a weekly newspaper which had once been published by Benjamin Franklin. This volume covers a year between the Boston Massacre and the Boston Tea Party. <br><br>The 25 June issue reports on the Gaspee Affair, in which a British customs schooner was burned by Rhode Island colonists: \"a great number of People in Boats boarded the Schooner, bound the Crew, and sent them ashore, after which they set Fire to the Vessel, and destroyed her.\" <br><br>The 11 November issue describes a militia drill by the Boston Cadets under Colonel John Hancock, and prints an exchange of correspondence between Boston's Governor Hutchinson and freeholders led by Samuel Adams. <br><br>The formation of a pre-revolutionary Committee of Correspondence in Boston was reported in the 18 November issue, in reaction to the response from Governor Hutchinson: \"It was then Moved that a Committee of Correspondence be appointed . . . to communicate and publish the same to the several Towns in this Province, and to the World.\" <br><br>The volume has passed through the ownership of 3 institutions, and the consignor has verified its proper release by all three.
