FOOTNOTE: "Peter Metcalf was a San Francisco cartman who claimed to have misplaced a cartload of goods during an 1851 fire. The extra-legal Vigilance Committee then performed a search of his house. Metcalf sued the Committee for this violation of his rights. These speeches were made by Metcalf's attorney, Rufus Allen Lockwood (1811-1857), who denounced the vigilantes with purple prose. \"Heed not the crocodile lamentations and hyena howlings over petty crimes, of those vampyres who at midnight drain the stream of life in your midst, and at mid-day repeat their horrid orgies with triumphant demonstrations\" (page 5).
