  unevenly toned, 3 short tears and chips in right margin, laid down on linen in early
  20th century; inscribed faintly in pencil in lower margin "Hon. Gideon Welles, with
  the regards of F.B. Carpenter," with name of Welles' daughter-in-law inscribed in

at-a-glance: 'New York: F.B. Carpenter, 1866'
FOOTNOTE: 'This engraving was done after an original 1864 White House life study by
  Francis Bicknell Carpenter (1830-1900). Mary Lincoln endorsed it as "the most perfect
  likeness of my beloved husband that I have ever seen," adding poignantly "The resemblance
  is so accurate in Mr. Halpin''s engraving that it will require far more calmness
  than I can now command to have it placed continuously before me." <br><br>According
  to family lore, the frame is said to be made from wood taken from the USS Hartford,
  Admiral Farragut''s famous Civil War flagship, although we find no additional documentation.
  Provenance: from the collection of Thomas Welles Brainard, the great-great-grandson
  of Gideon Welles. '
