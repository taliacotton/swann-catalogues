FOOTNOTE: "The formal count of the electoral college votes from the 1932 presidential election took place in the House chamber on the afternoon of 7 February 1933. Multiple copies of this pre-printed form were apparently signed for distribution to various figures. It lists the votes for each candidate by state and summarizes the tallies in favor of Franklin D. Roosevelt and John N. Garner as president and vice president as delivered to the President of the Senate, concluding that \"this announcement . . . shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons elected President and Vice President . . . and shall be entered, together with a list of the votes, on the Journals of the Senate and House of Representatives.\" These normally routine words are intoned on the floor of Congress every four years, most recently by Vice President Pence very early on the morning of 7 January 2021.
