FOOTNOTE: "The 69th New York Infantry, also known as the \"Fighting Irish,\" was one of the war's most celebrated regiments. They guarded the Union retreat at the First Battle of Bull Run, suffering heavy losses. This scrapbook was kept by Lieutenant William M. Giles (born circa 1829), a New York druggist, who commanded Company B at Bull Run during his initial 90-day enlistment; he was later in 1863 appointed as a medical storekeeper for the Army. This scrapbook, while not artistically compiled, is rich in primary source material for the 69th during the first months of the war, including these highlights: <br><br>A trimmed songsheet, \"Battle of Bull-Run, Dedicated to the 69th Regiment, N.Y.S.M.\" <br><br>A cargo list of what appear to be 48 enslaved people being shipped from Baltimore to New Orleans, with ages and heights given for each, but the ship and date not named. This and two other documents are captioned: \"These papers were picked up in a pocket book on the battlefield of Manassas or Bull Run on July 21st 1861, William M. Giles.\" <br><br>5 manuscript orders issued by the regiment's famed Colonel Michael Corcoran in July 1861, as written out by adjutant John McKeon. They include a 3 July order on the celebration of Independence Day (\"Capt. T.F. Meagher will read the Declaration of American Independence\"); copy of a 7 July letter to General Sherman regarding their enlistment term; a copy of Sherman's 11 July order requiring \"troops to be in light marching order\" and prepared to leave their knapsacks (ten days before Bull Run); a 13 July parade order; and the 13 July formation of a court martial. <br><br>Manuscript \"charges profered against Serg't Patrick Boyle for drunkness and abusive language\" against Col. Corcoran. Dated Fort Corcoran, 29 June 1861. <br><br>2 copies of a printed general order issued by Giles as commander of Company B, regarding a parade at the regimental armory, 14 October 1861.<br><br>Another printed order featuring the elaborate regimental seal (\"Gentle when stroked, fierce when provoked\"), dated New York, 9 October 1861. <br><br>Muster-out oath taken by Giles upon the expiration of his 90 days of service, 16 August 1861. <br><br>Oath taken by Giles as militia surgeon, August 1855. <br><br>Running account of spirits consumed by Lt. Giles, including whiskey, beer, ales, claret, champagne and a \"dinner for 4 friends,\" perhaps prepared by a local innkeeper, 7-26 June 1861. <br><br>4 manuscript receipts issued for work on Fort Corcoran in Washington, August 1861. <br><br>List signed by 46 men with their addresses, headed \"We the undersigned agree to become members of Co. B 69th Regt. N.Y.S.M. and to equip ourselves according to law.\" Undated. <br><br>Letter to \"my dearest husband\"; the final page with signature is pasted down, but is presumably from Mrs. Giles. Expresses joy at his imminent muster out, although she had heard \"how anxious Corcoran was to have the reg't remain.\" New York, 14 July 1861. <br><br>A pair of passes issued to Giles as medical storekeeper, August 1863. <br><br>A piece of North Carolina scrip issued for 5 cents on 1 October 1861, captioned \"Given by Daniel Shorter, Co. B, 69th Regt., taken prisoner at Manassas July 21st 1861, arrived at New York June 4 1862.\" <br><br>A pair of Confederate banknotes (Confederate Packing House, 25 cents, defective, Jacksonville, FL, 1862; and Confederate fifty-cent note issued 17 February 1864). <br><br>Copious newspaper clippings, many relating to the Irish Brigade, including several engravings."
