FOOTNOTE: "Among Confederate circles, General Edward A. Wild (1825-1891) was one of the most notorious Union generals. In April 1863 he became one of the first and most enthusiastic leaders of the United States Colored Troops as commander of \"Wild's African Brigade,\" with headquarters in Norfolk, VA. On several occasions, his brigade took Confederate women as hostages. One of them was Miss Nancy \"Nannie\" White of Knott's Island, NC, aged 23, who was captured on 21 December 1863 and sent back to the brigade headquarters in nearby Norfolk, VA. This may have been done in retaliation for her family's aid to escaped Confederate prisoners. She was held in the home of one of Wild's officers until released on 14 January 1864, when she wrote this letter exonerating General Wild from blame. <br><br>\"I respectfully relate that during the time that I have been a prisoner under you and confined in Capt. Croft's quarters, I have been treated very kindly, indeed more than I could expect, and have had everything done that could conduce to my comfort, and shall ever feel grateful to you for your lenientcy, and to Capt. Croft and family for the many kindnesses that I have received during my imprisonment.\" <br><br>Of course, a letter written by a hostage probably should not be taken literally, particularly if their release depends upon it. See the 2003 book by Frances H. Casstevens, \"Edward A. Wild and the African Brigade in the Civil War,\" pages 127-141; this letter is published on page 140, and was cited as belonging to a private collection (footnote 68 on page 292). "
