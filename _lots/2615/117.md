FOOTNOTE: "A recruiting broadside for what became the 1st District of Columbia Cavalry or \"Baker's Rangers,\" a shadowy unit which hunted down deserters and Confederate subversives in the capital region. Prospective members were recruited for \"special duty, to act in conjunction with the present National Detective Police in the execution of such Special Orders as may from time to time be issued by the Colonel commanding.\" The \"peculiar service for which this Battalion is organized\" required that the applicants be \"sober, honest, intelligent, able bodied young men\" and expert horsemen. Members were to be provided with \"the best and fleetest horses\" and Henry repeating rifles. In other words, this was not your great-grandfather's regiment. No other copies traced in OCLC or elsewhere. "
