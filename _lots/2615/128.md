TYPESET: "Illustrated broadside, 19½ x 14¾ inches, on thin paper with red stripes; folds, minimal wear."
at-a-glance: "Philadelphia: W.D. Jenkins, 17 September 1887"
FOOTNOTE: "An attractive presentation, illustrated with engravings of Presidents Washington and Cleveland, the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, and the flag. 5 small advertisements for Philadelphia businesses appear in the lower right. Its publication was announced in the Philadelphia Inquirer of 13 September 1887, which described it as a \"very pretty centennial souvenir.\" <br><br>Broadside printings of the Constitution are seen much less frequently than the Declaration of Independence, and this one is a particularly remarkable survival given the thin paper on which it was printed. This copy was well preserved by being folded into a Bible until this year. None traced in OCLC or at auction, although a similar 4th of July 1888 broadside program is recorded, “Published by Wm. D. Jenkins, 211 Spruce Street.\""
