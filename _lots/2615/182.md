FOOTNOTE: "The Dorchester South Meeting House, also known as the Second Congregational Church of Dorchester, was founded in 1804. It became a Nazarene Methodist church in the 1990s. This volume records on 59 pages a summary of sermons at the church from 1810 to 1816, listing the minister and the principal texts. The Rev. John Codman was the principal minister, but guest ministers were common. A few of the volumes from the period of the War of 1812 seem to address contemporary concerns, such as on 23 July 1812 shortly after fighting began: \"Fast Day, Mr. Codman, James 4-1. From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members.\" In the rear of the volume are recorded 7 pages of baptisms and deaths for the same period. "
