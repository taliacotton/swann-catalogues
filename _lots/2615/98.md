FOOTNOTE: "This meeting was called to fire up New York City's flagging patriotism, at approximately the halfway point between the wild enthusiasm of April 1861 and the anti-war Draft Riots of July 1863. This broadside urges \"all the zeal, all the power, and all the loyal feeling of its citizens, native and adopted,\" including the recruitment of new soldiers \"to fill up the veteran regiments of New-York volunteers\" and form new regiments, notably the predominantly Irish-American Corcoran's Brigade being formed by Col. Michael Corcoran of the legendary 69th New York. The notice concludes with a call to \"give your means, your strong arms, and your resolute hearts to put down rebellion, and to uphold the flag of the Union.\" The meeting is discussed in George Winston Smith's article \"The National War Committee of the Citizens of New York,\" in New York History, October 1947.
