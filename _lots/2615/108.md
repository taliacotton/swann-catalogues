FOOTNOTE: "This original piece of memorial art imagines a massive monument naming those soldiers who died at Philadelphia's military hospital. In the foreground, two allegorical figures mourn and record their valorous deeds. In the background can be seen a flag, a marching regiment, and a naval vessel. The list contains 16 names representing a variety of regiments extending from Maine to Michigan, with dates of death from November 1861 to 2 January 1863. A column was reserved for additional names to be inscribed later. One officer is listed, Captain John Carr of the 77th New York Infantry. The second to die at the hospital was Sarah Cullen, daughter of James Cullen of the 81st New York Infantry, who may have been a hospital attendant, or perhaps just fell ill while visiting her father.
