FOOTNOTE: "This photograph was taken shortly after the 17 September 1862 Battle of Antietam. According to the inscription, by 1 October it was already offered for sale in a Washington photo gallery. The original print run had apparently sold out very quickly, so this numbered sample card was sold--presumably at a discount. An interesting insight into the marketing and distribution of the Brady Gallery's work. "
