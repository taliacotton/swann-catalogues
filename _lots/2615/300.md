FOOTNOTE: "Although Texas had gained independence the previous year, this act authorizes the colonization of Texas by veterans of the struggle for Mexican independence, and offers concessions to allied Indian tribes and those who fought for the recovery of Texas. It also confirms Article 11 of the Colonization Act of 6 April 1830, which had prohibited Americans from settling in Texas and had helped spark the Texan Revolution: \"el congreso á favor de las tribus ó naciones indígenas, y de los cooperadores al restablecimiento de Tejas; no embarazándose por las leyes dadas hasta aquí sobre colonizacion, cuyas disposiciones se derogan en todo lo que contrarien á la presente, repitiéndose la prohibicion del art. 11 de la ley de 6 de Abril de 1830.\" This Ministry of the Interior printing was issued on the same day as the decree. Not in Streeter's Texas. Only one is traced in OCLC (Huntington Library), and none traced at auction since a Swann sale, 12 November 1981, lot 541. "
