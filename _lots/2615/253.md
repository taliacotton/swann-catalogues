FOOTNOTE: "The Oneida Community was founded by John Humphrey Noyes (1811-1886) in upstate Oneida, NY in 1848. They practiced complex marriage, and are credited with coining the phrase \"free love.\" They later instituted a eugenic breeding program, had communal child care, and endured grueling sessions of mutual criticism. In these pages, \"Noyes expounded his doctrines of spiritualism, communism, and free love; though uneven in its editing, it was often well written and interesting\"--Mott, page II:207. The issues include community gossip and international news in addition to the many essays reflecting Oneida doctrine. Lomazow 568."
