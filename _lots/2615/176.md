FOOTNOTE: "Leonard Wells Volk (1828-1895) produced his famous life mask of Lincoln in 1860. The sculptor's son Douglas Volk later contracted with the New York foundry S. Klaber & Co. to produce copies of his Lincoln bust. The firm produced a small pamphlet to advertise the work, which was reported widely in newspapers across the country in early February 1914. One of the busts was donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1914. See Hoffmann, “'The Animal Himself': Tracing the Volk Lincoln Sculptures. Part II: Replicas of Volk’s Original Casts,” Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association 42:1 (2021). "
