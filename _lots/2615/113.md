FOOTNOTE: "This volume was used to record official correspondence, incoming and outgoing, relating to the Union prison at Fort Mifflin, located south of Philadelphia on the outskirts of the present airport. The prison housed captured Confederates, Union deserters and other offenders, and civilians. Much of the correspondence relates to individual prisoners. A 7 January 1864 note describes two German-American draft dodgers. The next day expressed confusion regarding the arrival of a W.H. Power who was sent without irons and no paperwork. On 2 February 1864, the character of a Union soldier named Silas Mansfield is defended; he had been detailed as a provost guard back in 1862 but had been unfairly named as a deserter in his company rolls. On 11 February 1864 is recorded a dispute over sending Union and Rebel prisoners together to clean out a moat. On 19 February 1864, a Confederate named William Bowman who had deserted at Chambersburg during the Gettysburg campaign is recommended for release \"in consequence of his good conduct while here.\" <br><br>This volume was kept from January to May 1864 by Captain Cyrus S. Haldeman as Assistant Adjutant General under Major General George Cadwalader, military commander of Philadelphia. He often recorded messages from the Fort Mifflin post commander, Captain J.O. Fennie. After going unused for several months, the volume was taken over from November 1864 to July 1865 by Lieutenant Frank H. Wentz, who served as the post's adjutant, assistant quartermaster, and commissary of subsistence. These 1865 entries are less substantial. In the rear of the volume are 4 pages of personal ledger accounts kept by Wentz, 1870-1871. "
