FOOTNOTE: "Horace Resley (1815-1902) was running as a Union candidate for re-election as clerk of the Circuit Court of Allegany County, out on the Maryland panhandle between Pennsylvania and West Virginia. This being Maryland during the Civil War, the election came down to whether Resley was a \"Union man\"--and what being a \"Union man\" meant--and whether being a \"Union man\" was even a good thing. He had been accused by his opponent in a recent circular of being disloyal, and here rebuts those charges at length, demonstrating his full support of the Union cause going back to February 1861, including his correspondence with General Rosecrans to help arm the local militia. Resley won the election. No other examples of this broadside have been traced. "
