FOOTNOTE: "Mullet Key, a small chain of islands south of St. Petersburg, was used as a Union fort during the Civil War, and in 1889 began serving as a quarantine station to isolate travelers on their arrival to Florida. Construction on Fort de Soto on Mullet Key began in 1898 to help protect Tampa Bay during the Spanish-American War. The site was abandoned in 1937 and rededicated as Fort De Soto Park in 1963. This image of the station's officer quarters was shot by Tampa photographer Albion Morgner Windhorst (1881-1952). It shows a lone cannon pointing seaward as two soldiers patrol the porch. Early images from this fort appear to be scarce. "
