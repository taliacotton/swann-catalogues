at-a-glance: "Warren, PA, circa 12-16 July 1895"
FOOTNOTE: "This battered team photograph shows John \"Honus\" Wagner at the top right--and may be the earliest photograph of the legend in uniform. This was his first year in professional baseball; after a long career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, he is still regarded by consensus as the greatest shortstop who ever lived. <br><br>Warren, the county seat of Warren County in northwestern Pennsylvania, was part of the Iron and Oil League, a low-level minor league. The Warren Evening Democrat is available through newspapers.com, so by tracing the team's roster changes from day to day, we can develop a chronology. Al \"Butts\" Wagner, older brother of John / Honus, joined the team on 4 June. John first appeared in the lineup on 12 July. We believe the present image dates from circa 13 July, shortly after John joined the team. On 29 July, he badly injured his arm while running to catch a train, and was out of the lineup for almost 4 weeks, reappearing on 24 August. The team dispersed for the season on 18 September. <br><br>A well-preserved Warren team photograph from later in 1895, also showing John Wagner, hammered for $15,000 at Heritage Auctions in 2007. That image was carefully captioned with the names of all players. Several of them can be easily spotted in the present photograph. At top left is catcher Harry Smith, who later joined Wagner as a back-up catcher on the 1902-1907 Pirates; then second baseman Claude Ritchey, who would become Wagner's long-time double play partner in Pittsburgh; then a tall unidentified player at center whose face is obscured, perhaps pitcher Tom Vickery; then future Giants pitcher Bill Carrick, holding a ball as pitchers often did in 19th-century team photographs; and at right John \"Honus\" Wagner, glaring with hands on his hips. The middle row has a first baseman named Russell, who debuted with Warren on July 12; an unidentified player holding a ball, possibly left-handed pitcher Dave \"Toots\" Barrett, the only one of the team's mid-July pitchers with no other known image; Manager Franklin, wearing the same suit as in his Heritage photograph; and two unidentified players (possibly July mainstays Jakie Bullock and Jack Schrader, who left the team after 19 August and 7 August, respectively). Seated at left is pitcher Jake Hewitt, who left the team on 16 July, and pitched in 4 games for Pittsburgh in August--he is not in the Heritage photograph, but a grainy surviving photograph of him on Baseball Reference is a perfect match. Another unidentified player sits at front center, possibly outfielder Rickert from the Heritage photo, although it's a shaky match, and at right is Al \"Butts\" Wagner, brother of Honus. A family member inscribed Butts's image in ballpoint pen: \"Uncle Al Wagner.\" The Heritage photograph features several players who joined the team later than 16 July, including former major leaguer Gus McGinnis, who only played with the team on 23 August. The photographer Louis P. Greenlund (1868-1926), whose worn inked stamp appears on verso, is frequently mentioned in Warren newspapers from 1893 to 1898. <br><br>For more information, see A.D. Suehsdorf, \"Honus Wagner’s Rookie Year, 1895\" in The National Pastime, Winter 1987. "
