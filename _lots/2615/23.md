FOOTNOTE: "The International Exhibition of Modern Art, more commonly remembered as \"the Armory Show,\" was held at New York's 69th Regiment Armory from 15 February to 15 March 1913. It introduced a broader American audience to controversial European artists such as Duchamp, Matisse, and Cézanne. The reaction of mainstream critics was generally vicious, but its importance continues to resonate, including a November 2013 anniversary auction of Armory artists at Swann (which is located across the street from the Armory). None traced at auction; one is held by the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art as part of the papers of organizer Walt Kuhn. "
