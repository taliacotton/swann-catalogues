FOOTNOTE: "Oliver Holmes the 3rd (1777-1833) spent most of his life in Francestown, NH. He was not a close relation of the later poet or judge of the same name. At the time of this diary, he was an unmarried young man, working intermittently as a school teacher, farm laborer, sign painter, and runner of errands. The diary begins with a long and colorful account of an 8-day horseback journey to Boston and back through a heavy snowstorm. In Roxbury, MA he was compelled to share a bed with \"a small lad . . . troubled with dreams or haveing drank too much liquor,\" and in Sharon, MA he delayed his departure to watch the drawing of a lottery.<br><br>Holmes resumed teaching at his local school on 7 January 1799, which inspired an interesting 3-page description of his frustrations: \"Began the tiresome business of school teaching once more, for the paltry sum of ten dollars. . . . Repetitions must be made use of, repeated and forlorn. Repetitions loaded with threats and perplexities. Some will whisper & laugh, some pull hair and if you correct them, some shew their good breeding that they have been accustomed to at home.\" "
