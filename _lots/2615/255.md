at-a-glance: 'Anderston, Scotland: W. Gillespie & Co., circa 1800'
FOOTNOTE: 'This textile commemorates Washington''s decision to retire from public
  office. His decision to decline a third term as president set a long and venerable
  precedent, and set the tone that the presidency was not a lifetime appointment.
  His famous Farewell Address first appeared in a 19 September 1796 newspaper, and
  is still read aloud in the Senate on Washington''s Birthday each year. <br><br>A
  full-length portrait of Washington in military uniform is surrounded by seven numbered
  text panels. The first three offer a short and laudatory biography: "His late manly
  & noble resignation . . . will impress his parting & paternal instructions indelibly
  upon the hearts of his Countrymen." The four side panels contain extensive quotations
  from the Farewell Address. <br><br>This handkerchief was apparently produced shortly
  after the Farewell Address, and as Washington is spoken of in the present tense,
  it was probably produced before his 1799 death. It was manufactured by a Scottish
  firm. <br><br>Herbert Collins estimates the date at 1796-1800, and traces just one
  copy at the Smithsonian. Linda Eaton''s 2014 catalog for Winterthur estimates the
  date at 1800-1820. We trace none at auction, and only those two in institutions.
