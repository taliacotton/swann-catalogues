FOOTNOTE: "Captain J.H. Rambo of the 22nd Texas Infantry writes to a colonel that Private H.A. Nichols was wounded in the Battle of Pleasant Hill in April 1864, and requesting that he \"be detailed in the harness shop at Tyer Texas.\" A note by three surgeons from the Medical Examination board attests that Private Nichols had a \"gunshot wound in the right thigh partially severing the external hamstring\" and recommending \"post duty of some kind requiring but little locomotion.\" On verso are about a dozen docketing notes signed by a dizzying array of officers as the simple request worked its way up the chain of command. Major General John H. Forney signed in Crockett, TX on 28 March 1865, and the commander of the Department of Texas, John B. Magruder, over his department's 29 April inked stamp. Finally the request started to trickle back down to the head of the harness shop, who brought up a simple point on 12 May: \"If he is not a harness maker, I do not want him; if he is, his services are needed.\" The Department of Texas surrendered three weeks later.
