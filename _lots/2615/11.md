FOOTNOTE: "The Gazette was a Loyalist paper. This issue features the final letter from a long series written by Daniel Leonard, writing under the pseudonym \"Massachusettensis.\" Here, two weeks before Lexington and Concord, he attempts to discourage patriots from taking up arms: \"Do you expect to conquer in war? War is no longer a simple, but an intricate science, not to be learned from books. . . . His Majesty's generals, Gage and Haldimand, are possessed of every talent requisite to great commanders. . . . Alas! my friends, you have nothing to oppose this force, but a militia unused to service, impatient of command and destitute of resources. . . . Nothing short of a miracle could gain you one battle.\"<br><br>Also included is a brief note on the imminent posting of General Howe to America, where he soon became commander in chief of British forces: \"It is said that, with the additional Forces ordered for America, Lord How was to come out with two Regiments of Horse.\" "
