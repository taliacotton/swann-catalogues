FOOTNOTE: "John Jacob Hering (1842-1864) was the son of an affluent farmer in Beavercreek, Greene County, near Dayton in southwestern Ohio. In May 1864, he was commissioned a lieutenant in the 154th Ohio Infantry, a 100-day regiment which spent much of its term in and around New Creek, WV, guarding an important supply depot from Confederate raiders. <br><br>Hering did not see much action until the final days of his service, in a 4 August action sometimes called the Battle of New Creek Station, although it is not on most official lists of battles. On 2 August he noted \"rumors about the Rebs coming into camp,\" and the next day the cavalry \"report the enemy within 9 miles, 2,000 strong.\" He also noted that \"15 negroes came into camp, mounted.\" On the day of the battle, he reported \"loss of reg't, 9 miss'g, 4 wounded. . . . Fight commenced at 2, continued until 9 o'clock p.m. Co. A relieved Co. A of 11th [West] Va. in evening, remained on line all night. Baldwin wounded.\" On 5 August his company led the pursuit: \"154th with 2 pieces of artillery followed the Rebs 3 miles, Co. A in the advance skirmishing.\" With their fighting done, on the 6th \"boys went out on the battle ground in search of trophies.\" The regiment mustered out soon after. Lieutenant Hering had contracted typhoid during his last days of service, and died from it that October. See Robinson, History of Greene County, page 853. <br><br>WITH---a worn and incomplete pocket Bible, lacking several leaves including the title page, inscribed John Hering on front pastedown, AND 5 company orders and memoranda laid in to the diary.
