at-a-glance: "[New York]: Kelloggs & Thayer, [1844]"
FOOTNOTE: "This campaign print by Kellogg was probably inspired by the similar \"Grand National Banners\" which Currier issued for both parties every four years. It features jugate portraits of the Whig ticket of Henry Clay and Theodore Frelinghuysen, which went on to lose the election to the comparatively unknown James Polk. At top is an eagle above six crossed flags (the cantons lightly tinted blue), while below are a farm couple sitting atop a literal cornucopia of trade goods, all surrounded by a theater curtain with highlights in red and yellow. The print was published and distributed jointly by Kelloggs & Thayer in New York; E.B. & E.C. Kellogg in Hartford, CT; and Dwight Needham in Buffalo, NY. We find none in OCLC. "
