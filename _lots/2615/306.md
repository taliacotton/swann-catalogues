FOOTNOTE: "John Hunt McIlvain (1808-1885) came from a prominent Philadelphia family of lumber merchants, and became a noted ornithologist. This letter was written on his 1853 trip to the Rocky Mountains. <br><br>He writes from Fort Laramie, which had been established in 1849 on the site of an older trading post. \"I had walked a short distance down the Laramie [River], & seeing the mail coming, hurried home with trembling anxiety. All the officers & souldiers were assembled in the office & I saw each receiving their letters, some ½ dozen, and quietly awaited my turn without speaking a word; but when informed 'Mr. Mc, there is nothing for you' I felt my heart sinck within me, & my discomforture was noted by every body. What shall I say? My forebodings are dreadfull. Is my wife or my precious children gone? I have now been here between 4 & 5 weeks since which this very mail & the same driver have been to Independence on the frontier & returned. Not one word since the day I left the boundary. . . . I will endeavor to bear my disappointment with philosophy.\" A bit of good news: McIlvain's wife and children all survived long past 1853. McIlvain also receives postal advice from one of the post's officers, Hugh B. Fleming: \"Mr. F. has just learned of his promotion, & he is worthy of it if any military man is, he is quite young & also the quartermaster here.\" "
