FOOTNOTE: "The fate of the small bundle of papers found upon Lincoln's body has been a subject of some intrigue. Edward McPherson (1830-1895), the longtime clerk of the House of Representatives, tried to unravel it. According to the Library of Congress, Justice David Davis wrote to McPherson on 22 June 1866, \"stating that the papers found on President Lincoln's person were sealed by Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War. Later the papers were opened in Justice Davis' presence.\" <br><br>In the present letter, written 3 weeks later, Stanton's loyal personal secretary wrote to McPherson: \"The papers found upon the person of President Lincoln, and which you were hunting for recently, have turned up. Please call and see the Secretary about them today if possible.\" <br><br>WITH--a carte-de-visite photograph of McPherson by Brady, signed by McPherson in the image. "
