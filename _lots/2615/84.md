Soldiers are to be arrested if found in town after sundown or without a pass, and are not permitted to gather in saloons or bring liquor into camp. As for civilians, \"all persons are forbidden to drive or ride in the streets in a fast or reckless manner,\" and saloon-keepers who get soldiers drunk \"will be considered as keepers of disorderly houses and treated accordingly.\" No other examples traced at auction, in OCLC, or elsewhere.
