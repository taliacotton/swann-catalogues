customCapitalization: false
at-a-glance: Springfield, VT, circa 1920s-1950s
TYPESET: "<p>Approximately 350 silver-print photographs, each about 7½ x 9½ inches,
  many mounted back to back on stubs, bound in 4 albums. Oblong 4to, original leatherette
  3-ring binders, moderate wear, with worn printed labels on backstrips; some with
  cello tape mounting, some with typed captions laid down, a bit musty.</p>"
FOOTNOTE: 'Parks and Woolson, manufacturers of woolen cloth finishing machinery, was
  established in 1829, drawing water power from the Black River. Upon its closing
  in 2003, it was the oldest machine shop in Springfield, VT. The archive documents
  the company''s production from the 1920s through the 1950s, including images of
  their products installed in factories across New England: the Broad Brook Company
  of East Windsor, CT; Cranston Print Works in Rhode Island; Vassalboro Mills in Maine;
  Trenton Dyeing and Finishing in Canada; and many others. Some images show workers
  positioned nearby, and many show textiles emerging or positioned within the apparatus.
  An appealing group for those who recall New England''s once-thriving textile mills.'
