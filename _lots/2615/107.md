FOOTNOTE: "Most of these photographs are of the officers of the 104th Pennsylvania Infantry, which served from 1861 through 1865 in the Peninsula Campaign, in South Carolina, at the fall of Petersburg and elsewhere. Most are the size of cartes-de-visite but were mounted directly into an album rather than on cards, possibly by commander Colonel William Watts Hart Davis (1820-1910). They have been neatly clipped from the album. Included are portraits of the regiment's Colonel Davis; Lieutenant Colonel Thompson Hart; Major John M. Gries, who was mortally wounded at Seven Pines while attempting to rescue the regimental colors; his brother Chaplain William R. Gries; Captain E.L. Rogers, who commanded the regiment at Seven Pines after all of the regimental officers were wounded; and Lieutenant John K. McCoy, mounted with his clipped signature as Assistant Adjutant General. Also included are, from other regiments, William M. Burger of the 1st New York Engineers; Captain George F. Towle of the 4th New Hampshire Infantry (mounted with a clipped signature); Lieutenant Fred A. Sawyer of the 47th New York Infantry (signed and mounted on verso of Lt. Col. Hart); and General John Wool. Last is an unmounted 7 x 5-inch albumen photograph of a grand montage of the 104th Pennsylvania depicting in miniature three encampments and all of the regimental and company officers from early in the war.
