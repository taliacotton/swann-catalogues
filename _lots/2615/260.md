FOOTNOTE: 'Gideon Welles (1802-1878) was chosen by President Lincoln as his Secretary
  of the Navy in 1861, and remained in office through the end of Andrew Johnson''s
  term in 1869. Under his leadership, the Union Navy blockaded Southern ports, proceeded
  up the Mississippi River, and played a major role in crushing the Confederacy. <br><br>Welles
  was born and raised in Glastonbury, Connecticut, where he spent most of his life.
  He was an early graduate of what became Norwich University in Vermont, and returned
  to Connecticut to practice law, edit a newspaper, and serve in the state legislature.
  His highest-profile position before the Civil War was as Chief of the Bureau of
  Provisions and Clothing for the Navy during the period of the Mexican-American War.
  He opposed slavery and became an early member of the new Republican Party in 1854.
  <br><br>This large and substantial archive contains the personal correspondence,
  diaries, and manuscripts of Gideon Welles, as well as family correspondence, printed
  ephemera, and photographs. At the heart of the collection are 153 of his Autograph
  Letters Signed, almost all of them to his son Thomas Glastonbury Welles (1846-1892),
  with most of them written during the war years. At the outset of the war, Thomas
  was 14 years old. Shortly before Fort Sumter, Gideon urges Thomas: "The man who
  will not stand by his country in the hour of peril will not deserve respect" (7
  April 1861). He worked to discourage Thomas from prematurely joining the Navy: "No
  man can be a ship master, or anything but a working drudge of a sailor--the lowest
  class--without an education" (9 February 1862). While Gideon mentioned the ominous
  Confederate incursion into Maryland to Thomas, he went into more detail in a 7 September
  1862 partial letter to his wife Mary Jane: "We have information that the Rebels
  had crossed the Upper Potomac in considerable force. . . . They are on this side
  full sixty five thousand strong, nearly one half their force having reached Frederick.
  . . . Not less than two hundred regiments passed our door last night between 10
  and 1 o''clock. The street was a mass of living men, moving rapidly forward all
  that time."<br><br>When Thomas joined the Naval Academy and was posted on the famed
  USS Constitution for training, Gideon wrote "There have been many good and brave
  and true hearts on her deck. May you be as worthy" (1 October 1862). As the war
  progressed and Thomas matured, Gideon shared more insights into military matters.
  Shortly after the USS Monitor was lost in a storm, he wrote "The loss of the Monitor
  gave us pain, for she had won herself a name and character that endeared her more
  to us than a more costly vessel." In reaction to General McClellan''s presidential
  campaign against Lincoln, Welles dismissed his military accomplishments: "He accomplished
  very little, and seemed indisposed to take advantage of success. . . . He thought
  more of himself than the country, and tried to have them engage for him rather than
  the war" (18 August 1864)." Thomas left the Naval Academy to join the Army as a
  young officer. Welles expressed concern about his new commander Godfrey Weitzel:
  "He has a fair reputation as an officer, but I have an impression that he sometimes
  drank more whiskey than he should" (10 October 1864). <br><br>Welles wrote several
  letters to Thomas during the dramatic conclusion of the war. On 14 April, the Secretary
  was (like most of the north) in a state of relief: "Last evening all Washington
  was in a blaze of illumination, fire-works and displays commemorative of the great
  victory. The truth is we have been doing little else than rejoicing for the last
  ten days." By 18 April, the mood had changed: "Nothing since the death of Washington
  has ever cast so great a gloom over the whole country. That one so gentle, and so
  kind, whose feelings would permit him to harm no human being, should have been so
  assaulted and slain is among the most appalling acts ever recorded." On 20 April
  he offered a fuller tribute: "His gentle virtues and noble qualities will grow brighter
  with time, and the world will better appreciate him in the future than while he
  was among us. Few such men have ever lived. No finer or better man ever stood at
  the head of a nation. I knew him well and was honored by his friendship, and it
  will be one of the treasured memories of my life." On 25 April, he reported on his
  wife Mary Jane Hale Welles (1817-1886), one of the First Lady''s closest friends:
  "Your mother spends a portion of every day with Mrs. Lincoln, who has not recovered
  from the terrible shock which prostrated her." <br><br>Gideon''s 29 postwar letters
  to Thomas are also interesting, particularly for his perspective on President Andrew
  Johnson. Welles was one of Johnson''s few loyal supporters in Washington. During
  the impeachment proceedings, he raged "If the Radicals by fraud or force or both
  shall attempt to continue in power against the popular sentiment, strife and desolation
  will follow. . . . I detest them almost as much as the secessionists" (3 May 1868).
  Upon Johnson''s death, he reflected on 5 August 1875: "Johnson was an honest man,
  and a true constitutionalist, with fearless moral & physical courage."<br><br>The
  collection also contains approximately 238 letters received by Welles, the majority
  of them from family members. As a young aide-de-camp on the day after the Battle
  of the Crater, Thomas wrote a great war letter in its own right: "We proceeded at
  3 a.m. to the trenches to await the explosion of Burnside''s mine. . . . It arose
  some one or two hundred feet, sending up earth, stones and a whole regiment or more
  of rebels. . . . The darkies made a very good charge, but it soon became too heavy
  for them. . . . I was in front of the support and running with all my might towards
  what appeared almost certain death. It was impossible to retreat. . . . A shell
  struck within twenty feet of us, killing a captain and wounding several more. .
  . . A sudden sort of spasm succeeded by a loud explosion and finishing with a ringing
  in my ears, and a thought that I had been hit in the back of my head succeeded,
  and for ten or fifteen seconds I was perfectly insensible" (1 August 1864). Thomas
  also wrote several letters in the wake of the Lincoln assassination, urging his
  father to exercise caution: "Have a sentry from Marine Guard at your door, and be
  careful who you see" (16 April 1865). A few of the letters are from official correspondents,
  including 3 from General Edward O.C. Ord re Thomas G. Welles joining his staff,
  1864-1865; Robert Todd Lincoln, 1869; Horace Binney Sergeant, 1872 (requesting "the
  official facts of the expedition under Admiral Farragut against New Orleans and
  Mobile"); Edward Everett (as "E.E."), 1862, and Rear Admiral David D. Porter, 1864.
  Two anonymous letters from 1863 (24 February and 6 June) discuss Confederate blockade
  runners. <br><br>The collection includes four pre-war diaries by Welles, dated 1836,
  1844, 1852, and 1855, all rich in political talk. The 1844 diary only covers two
  weeks in April, but is perhaps the most interesting. John Milton Niles (1787-1856),
  a political mentor and friend of Welles, had been elected to the United States Senate
  in 1842, but before he could take office, the death of his wife triggered a nervous
  breakdown, and he was committed to an asylum. By April 1844, Niles had been released,
  and Welles accompanied him as moral support on the terrifying journey to Washington
  to assume his place in the Senate. On 11 April, Niles made his first appearance
  in Congress: "Mr. Buchanan, he thought, & not without reason, treated him coldly.
  . . . Niles had hoped for a warm & friendly greeting from B and expected that he
  if anyone would earnestly & cordially welcome him into the Senate." Two days later,
  "one of the reporters enquired of Bigelow so loud as to have him hear, whether he
  was still crazy." On 14 April, "he told me of the delusions he had experienced,
  and seems not yet willing fully to admit they were delusions." This diary is a fascinating
  look at the perceptions of mental health struggles in the halls of power. The 1852
  and 1855 diaries are steeped in local Connecticut politics and real estate deals,
  including repeated clashes with Hartford''s most famous arms manufacturer: "Some
  talk with sundry persons respecting Sam Colt, who is either playing a game or is
  exceedingly stupid" (11 March 1852). In 1855, he expressed disgust at the emergence
  of the Know-Nothing Party in Connecticut: "The order of Know-Nothings held a state
  convention & nominated a ticket. Met Ezra Clark Jr. in Paine''s office, asked him
  if he belonged to the order of KN, said he did not. Put the question three times
  in different forms. He unqualifiedly denied that he was. Yet was the evening before
  made their candidate for Congress" (22 February). <br><br>A box of manuscripts by
  and about Welles contains some treasures. An undated political essay includes a
  long denunciation of President Grant: "It was a matter of amazement to me that a
  person who had his opportunities was so unfamiliar with the practical workings of
  our political system. . . . He is, beyond the ordinary run of men, deficient in
  civil administrative capacity and intelligence"; Admiral Foote said "he preferred
  Grant [above other generals] notwithstanding his insignificant personal appearance,
  provided he would let whiskey alone." Juvenile manuscripts go back to 1817 and probably
  earlier; a certificate of merit he received is from circa 1809. A 24-page biography
  of Welles in calligraphic hand with carte-de-visite portrait of Welles is dated
  September 1862; his quite worn commission on vellum as chief of the Bureau of Provisions
  is signed by President James Polk, 1846.<br><br>Gideon''s wife Mary Jane Hale Welles
  is represented by her personal manuscript recipe book dated 1869, rendered more
  interesting by notations on her famous friends. Corn starch pudding and charlotte
  russe are noted "From Mrs. Lincoln"; corn fritters are marked "Pres L''s favorite,
  Mrs. Lincoln''s receipt, Mrs. Lincoln''s, good"; at end, corn soup is marked "Pres.
  Johnson''s" and potato soup just below is marked "Pres. Johnson''s favorite." Also
  included is a manuscript invitation from Mr. Lincoln at the Executive Mansion (not
  in Lincoln''s hand). Among the letters received by son Edgar Thaddeus Welles are
  3 from Admiral David G. Farragut, who wrote on 28 September 1863 from Hastings,
  NY: "At Sabine Pass, the soldiers no doubt overruled the officers of the navy to
  violate their instructions. When the soldiers were sent down to Galveston by Gen''l
  Banks, I instructed them to land upon Pelican Island where the gunboats could protect
  them, instead of which Bingham & the soldiers determined to land on the wharf at
  Galveston, where they were all captured." Edgar''s scrapbook of newspaper clippings
  on his father''s cabinet career is also included. Other papers of family members
  include Yale essays and correspondence of father-in-law Elias White Hale dating
  back to 1792. Son Edgar was an autograph collector. A folder of 28 letters, clipped
  signatures, and autograph book entries includes William Seward and many other prominent
  politicians of the 1850s and 1860s. An album of mostly clipped signatures includes
  Presidents Madison, Polk, Pierce, Buchanan, Johnson, and Grant among many others,
  and another album contains signatures of most of the senators in the 25th Congress
  including Franklin Pierce, Daniel Webster, James Buchanan, John C. Calhoun, and
  Henry Clay, as well as President Martin Van Buren and 5 cabinet members. The collection
  also includes 62 checks bearing the signature of Welles, as well as 10 envelopes
  bearing his franking signature. One prized heirloom was the appointment of son Thomas
  Welles as Navy midshipman in November 1862, signed by his father as Secretary of
  the Navy. <br><br>Graphic material includes a miniature watercolor portrait of Welles,
  4 x 2½ inches oval; approximately 95 photographs depicting mostly family members
  and Civil War-era celebrities (most in carte-de-visite or cabinet-card formats);
  and an untitled and unsigned pencil sketch of an ironclad ship. Printed material
  includes an 1831 Bible signed by Gideon Welles on flyleaf; a worn memorial pamphlet
  "State Council of Pennsylvania, O. of U.A.M., In Memoriam Abraham Lincoln," gilt-stamped
  on front cover for "Hon. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy"; and a broadside
  seating chart for Delmonico''s, "Dinner to the President of the United States in
  Honor of his Visit to the City of New York, August 29th, 1866." A pair of leather
  portfolios, one gilt-stamped "Gideon Welles," the other "Gideon Welles, Secretary
  of the Navy," are included. For those anxious to know more about the shape of Welles''s
  skull, see L.N. Fowler''s "Synopsis of Phrenology" pamphlet annotated with a full
  report dated 1845. The family saved large quantities of invitations, calling cards,
  and similar ephemera, perhaps 200 items, from the 1820s-1870s. Many are inserted
  into a large black album. Highlights include a Civil War pass issued to "Gideon
  Welles and Friends" dated 6 May 1864; a ticket for the 1865 Grand Review of Troops
  issued by General Augur; a ticket to "Mr. Bancroft''s Eulogy" on Lincoln in Congress,
  1866; an engraved undated invitation from "The President" to Welles (possibly Buchanan
  as no wife is noted); an engraved invitation from Andrew Johnson to Gideon and Mrs.
  Welles, 8 February 1868; a pair of Mrs. Andrew Johnson calling cards; a pair of
  William Seward engraved invitations; and a ticket to a "Citizen''s Reception to
  his Excellency President Johnson." <br><br>A more detailed inventory of this nationally
