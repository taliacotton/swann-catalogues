FOOTNOTE: "First edition of Webster's translation, one of the earliest American revisions to the King James version. Webster first conceived of updating the language of the Bible in 1822, but met with little encouragement. However, after the success of his 1828 Dictionary he revived the project with the mindset of producing a non-sectarian Bible to modernize archaic language, correct improper grammar and rectify mistranslations from the original Hebrew and Greek. He thought that \"a version thus amended may require no alteration for two or three centuries to come\" (Preface, page v). Hills 826; Wright, pages 141-48. Provenance: 19th-century ownership signatures of Luther P. Hubbard (undated) and R.T. Hall (1894); after ca. 1954 in the Howell Bible Collection, Pacific School of Religion (properly released).
