FOOTNOTE: "This pro-Dewey campaign piece hoped to peel off some of Roosevelt's Black supporters, using Roosevelt's running mate Harry Truman as a wedge issue. Truman is portrayed as a segregationist with the support of the likes of Theodore Bilbo. Roosevelt is attacked for his \"sordid record of racial injustice,\" particularly the treatment of soldiers in the World War, while the Republican challenger Thomas Dewey hoped to \"blaze a new trail of justice and integration.\" It is illustrated with numerous photographs and 3 topical cartoons by popular illustrator Clare Barnes Jr. We trace no other examples in OCLC, at auction, or elsewhere.
