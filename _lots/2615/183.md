FOOTNOTE: "This club was founded in northeast Massachusetts by 10 musicians, and soon expanded to 15. They agreed that \"no spectators shall be admitted at any meeting of the Band for rehearsal\" and that \"all unnecessary noise, tuning of instruments &c shall be considered out of order.\" At rehearsals, band members often brought original compositions which would be named in their honor, such as \"Thompson's Quickstep\" and \"Tenney's Quickstep.\" They ruled that \"no change of instruments shall be made by any member without the consent of the band.\" At one meeting they voted that \"George Harnden have liberty to exchange the Drum for the Trumpet, and that Mr. A.B. Noyes be requested to play the Bass Drum.\" Snare drum, cymbals and fife are also mentioned at various points. One member, David B. Tenney, was paid 50 cents per piece to write out arrangements for each instrument. The band's first public concert was scheduled on 24 January 1850 with 4 vocal and 9 instrumental pieces, and that same day they agreed to play at a Temperance Levee in nearby North Andover. A gig at the Universalist Church brought in $20.31, and more bookings followed, as well as oyster suppers in their honor. Things seemed to be going well, but then the band voted to cancel two bookings, went silent for two weeks, and on 25 March 1850 voted \"to sell the property of the band at auction this evening\" and \"the President of the Band act as auctioneer.\" The money was divided among the members and the band was summarily dissolved, just five months after it was launched.
