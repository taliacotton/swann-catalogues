FOOTNOTE: 'On the first morning of the Battle of Gettysburg, 1 July 1863, the Union
  Army''s 1st Corps was buckling under the Confederate onslaught northwest of the
  town center. As they fell back to Cemetery Ridge, the 16th Maine Infantry was given
  an impossible task: hold their position at any cost, to slow down the Confederate
  advance and guard the Union retreat. They were soon surrounded and overwhelmed.
  Shortly before they were captured, the color guard tore up the blue and gold regimental
  flag, distributing pieces among the troops so the Confederates could not enjoy it
  as a trophy. <br><br>This view shows the 16th Maine shortly before they were overwhelmed.
  They are gathered in a tight semi-circle reminiscent of Custer''s Last Stand, with
  saber-wielding officers issuing commands from within the circle, and dead and wounded
  comrades on all sides. In the foreground, a Union artilleryman and his horse lie
  dead beside a cannon. The much larger Confederate force, charging from the left,
  has suffered losses as well. Several other Confederate units can be seen far in
  the background, advancing without resistance. The "16th Maine Vols." battle flag
  and the Stars and Stripes are still waving proudly at the front of the Union line.
  <br><br>The painting is signed only "C.F.L." It does not seem to be copied from
  any other view, nor do any other depictions of the battle seem to be copied from
  it. While it could not have been sketched from life, it seems likely to have sprung
  from the memories of a 16th Maine participant. The only member of the regiment in
  1863 whose initials match C.F.L. was Cherbury Fitzalan Lothrop (1838-1936), a farmer
  from Chesterville, ME who enlisted as a sergeant and mustered out as a 1st Lieutenant.
  He was taken prisoner at Gettysburg. After the war he ran a country store in Chesterville
  through 1890, was active in veteran affairs and his church choir, was a Baptist
  minister, and taught at the Maine Central Institute. He retired to his daughter''s
  home in Everett, MA in the early 20th century. At Gettysburg, Lothrop was a first
  sergeant. A first sergeant is a focal point of the composition, holding his rifle
  with its butt to the ground just within the circle behind the battle flag, and coolly
  surveying the fighting. <br><br>The landscape is similar to the actual site of the
  16th Maine''s last stand. Their monument stands today on Doubleday Avenue in Gettysburg,
  near the present Doubleday Inn. Looking west from the road are rolling hills in
  the mid-ground, framed against larger hills in the background. The hills are not
  a perfect match, but some areas are now forested which may obscure the actual view.
  The artist may have painted the scene from memory, or visited the battlefield later
  in life to make sketches. <br><br>Provenance: this painting was owned circa 1978
  by the Argosy Book Store, whose proprietor Ruth Shevin made a photograph still held
  in the reference files at the Winterthur Library in Delaware. Winterthur independently
  made the same attribution of Cherbury Lothrop as the likely artist. The painting
  was apparently sold to the consignor''s mother between 1978 and her passing in 1981. '
