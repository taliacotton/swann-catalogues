at-a-glance: "New York: Illman & Pilbrow, circa 1834"
FOOTNOTE: "A scarce illustrated bestiary, with an introductory leaf and then illustrated poems abut the lion, fox, bear, elephant, tiger, ass, sheep, horse, ox, dog, and cat. The firm of Illman & Pilbrow was active from about 1829 to 1855. The owner's signature, \"Smith A. Steere,\" might help estimate the date with more precision. The only boy we find with this name in early 19th century was Smith Asa Steere (1826-1915) of Glocester, RI. Assuming he was about 8 or 10 when he inscribed the book, it could not have been published much later than 1836. One example in OCLC, at the American Antiquarian Society; none traced at auction. "
