FOOTNOTE: "Burrill Arnold (1811-1859) was a general store owner in the small village of Centerville (now in West Warwick, RI). While standing by the window of his store, talking with a customer, an unknown assailant shot him in the back. His temperance activism, which contributed to the arrest of local rumsellers, was thought to be the motive. Two suspects were arrested, but were acquitted the following year. See the New York Daily Herald, 8 June 1859; Fall River Daily News, 19 March 1860; and New England Farmer, 31 March 1860. No other examples traced in OCLC or at auction. "
