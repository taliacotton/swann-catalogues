FOOTNOTE: "A large and early patent medicine broadside for a miracle liniment which \"has never failed to cure, when properly applied; and being an extract, purely from the vegetable kingdom, there is no danger in its use.\" It was primarily intended for rheumatism, but also recommended for coughs, colds, chilblains, sprains, and cuts, among other ailments. Directions for use are included, along with two testimonial letters, and a long list of satisfied customers. David Andrews of Providence, RI was the manufacturer, and Grosvenor & Chase of the same city its sole authorized agents. The liniment was advertised in various New England newspapers from 1846 to 1848, but we trace no other examples of this broadside. "
