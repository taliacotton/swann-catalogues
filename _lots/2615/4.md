FOOTNOTE: "Edgar Laplante (circa 1888-1944) was a con man from Central Falls, RI. In his longest-running scam, from about 1917 to 1926, he assumed the character of Chief White Elk (or sometimes Prince Tewanna Ray), and toured the world singing, dancing, and giving speeches on Indian rights. His purported tribal affiliation was generally left vague, although we find one reference to him as a \"Cherikee.\" His wife Burtha Thompson often accompanied him, billed as \"the Princess.\" He was imprisoned for fraud in both Switzerland and Mussolini's Italy. This is his own personal scrapbook kept as Chief White Elk, apparently maintained to demonstrate his credentials to the gullible. It is filled with photographs, testimonial letters, promotional broadsides, newspaper clippings, and more. Highlights: <br><br>A letter from the chairman of an American Red Cross chapter in California testifying that \"Dr. Whitelk\" volunteered during the influenza outbreak, \"thinking not of himself but only of the welfare of the helpless who were left in his charge,\" 14 November 1918. <br><br>Letters from the offices of the Treasury Department and Committee on Public Information addressed to Chief White Elk, thanking him for his patriotic endeavors, 1918. <br><br>A promotional photograph of William F. \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody with a quite possibly forged inscription, \"With my best compliments to Chief White Elk, W. Cody, May 15th 1914.\" <br><br>A photograph of \"Milton J. Thompson, my father-in-law\" which ties the album to Laplante, although his born name appears nowhere in the album. <br><br>Certainly one of the strangest lots to pass through Swann's Americana department--and we have seen some strange ones.
