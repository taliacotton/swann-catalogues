FOOTNOTE: "A richly detailed description of the reading of the Emancipation Proclamation to a group of freedmen in Washington at noon on New Year's Day, 1863. Numerous attendees are named, described, and quoted, and many of the hymns are named. This report may have been written expressly for Walton's Daily Journal, a rather obscure Vermont newspaper. We do not find it published in other newspapers or in book form, but it seems well worthy of further notice. "
