FOOTNOTE: "This broadside consists of two related orders. In the first, Assistant Adjutant General Phillip George Bier responds to reports that Frederick citizens had aided Jubal Early's recent Confederate cavalry raid into Maryland, even \"pointing out to the Rebels . . . the property of Union citizens.\" Bier orders that all of these disloyal citizens be arrested and sent to military prison in West Virginia, sending \"\"their families beyond our lines South.\" He adds that \"You will seize their Houses to be used for Hospitals, Government Offices, and Store Houses\" and \"their furniture you will have sold at Public Auction.\" <br><br>The second order is from Union General David Hunter, newly returned from his own marauding Lynchburg Campaign in western Virginia. Hunter orders that every male citizen of Frederick be given a week to swear an oath of allegiance to the Union: \"All persons thus failing will be regarded as Secessionists, and treated as directed in the above order.\"<br><br>Both orders were relayed to John J. Yellott, major and commanding officer of the 1st Regiment of the Potomac Home Brigade, who issued this broadside. None traced in OCLC or at auction. "
