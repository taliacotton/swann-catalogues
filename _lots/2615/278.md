It shows the company's extensive lines in Colorado and New Mexico, as well as roads, mining regions, and topography. <br><br>The second map, also by von Motz, is titled \"Map Showing the Property of the Central Colorado Improvement Company,\" 8¼ x 13½ inches, with minimal wear. On another folding sheet are two elevation profiles of the railroad, 8¾ x 33 inches, with just a bit of wear in the fore-edge margin.
