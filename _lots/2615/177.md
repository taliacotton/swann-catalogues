FOOTNOTE: "Ellen E. Armstrong (1914-1979) is generally regarded as the only African-American woman on the touring magician circuit in the mid-twentieth century. She was born in South Carolina, the daughter of a magician named J. Hartford Armstrong, and toured with him for years from Florida to Pennsylvania. After her father's death in 1939, she continued to tour on her own until about 1970. The \"1889\" in the title presumably refers to when her father began touring. "
