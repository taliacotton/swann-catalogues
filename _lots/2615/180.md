FOOTNOTE: "Deborah Salter (1640-1719) and her husband Robert Searles (1636-1717) married in England and settled in Dorchester, MA by 1662. This seemingly unrecorded and unpublished pious tribute to her character and celebration of her life includes verses regarding her reasons for leaving the land of her birth. It begins, \"Great Conqueror! What must thy Icy hand Subject each age and sex at thy command?\" In the second stanza, \"In Europe's garden born brought up with care; by godly parents whose ancesters there; a plentiful estate did long retain, until the most unhappy Charles's reign; who did his subjects ancient rights invade; and was a victim to their fury made; then wealth living lost, peace from the nature gone; and Charles the Second mounted on the throne; she being married loved not to stay; in Europe but came with her mate away; took ship upon renowned England's shore; crossed the Atlantick (never cross'd before.)\"<br><br>Her death is variously recorded as 1712, 1713, 1714, or 1717, but this poem states that she died on 2 March 1718/9 in her 80th year. It is signed twice in a different hand by Jabez Searle, possibly her son who died in 1724. It is also signed \"G. Searle,\" another relative who apparently served as the scribe. "
