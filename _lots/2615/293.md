FOOTNOTE: "A compilation of 15 key documents relating to the Texas Revolution in March and early April 1836, covering both the Goliad campaign and the siege of the Alamo, some of them as reported in an issue of the \"Diario del Gobierno de la Republica Mexicana.\" <br><br>They include the 20 March instrument of surrender by General James Fannin at Goliad (pages 5-6), and the internal debate between President Santa Anna and General Urrea over the fate of the prisoners which culminated in the Goliad Massacre. Also included is a Spanish translation of the last appeal for assistance by Alamo commander William Travis, dated 3 March 1836, which concludes \"Victoria ó muerte!!\" (Victory or Death). We can find no other example of this Spanish translation in print. <br><br>4 documents are signed in type by Santa Anna, dated 18 March, 26 March, 27 March, and 28 March. In this last letter, which we have not found published elsewhere, he expresses outrage to General Urrea about the arrogance and defiance of Travis: \"En el sitado periódico y parte dicho del comandante Travis, se nota tambien la arrogancia y desprecio con que estos foragidos insultaban el acreditado valor del ejército mexicano ; y si bien pelearon hasta la desesperacion, tambien se ha dado á sus compañeros una terrible leccion de la suerte que les está reservada á los que como ellos atenten á la integridad de la repúblico, provocando su justa venganza.\" Translated: \"In the newspaper statement by Commander Travis, the arrogance and contempt with which these outlaws insulted the courage of the Mexican army is also noted; and although they fought to the point of desperation, their companions have also been given a terrible lesson in the fate that is reserved for those who, like them, violate the integrity of the republic, provoking their just revenge.\"<br><br>5 other letters are signed in type by José de Urrea, commander of the Goliad Campaign. 2 are by the Mexican Secretary of War José María de Tornel, and a 20 March letter by Colonel Francisco de Garay describes the Mexican victory at Goliad. The final document repeats a report on the Mexican attack on San Felipe de Austin, which had been published in the 28 April 1836 issue of another Mexican newspaper, \"La Lima del Vulcano.\" <br><br>We trace no other examples of this important pamphlet--not in OCLC, Palau, Streeter's Texas, or via Google.
