FOOTNOTE: "Contains two untitled, uncredited, but apparently original poems in honor of the late president. \"Ode I\" begins \"When the Almighty's behest / In these climes of the west / Bade empire be / From the treasures of Heav'n / Was our Washington giv'n / And tyrant pow'r was driven / By liberty.\" \"Ode II\" begins \"While free-born millions swell the song / To hail this joyful day.\" The second ode was apparently composed by the Rev. Charles Jenkins; it was later published as the closing words of a memorial sketch of Jenkins published in 1833 by D.C. Colesworthy, who asserted that it was \"written for the anniversary of Washington's birth-day, and sung on the occasion.\" <br><br>No other examples traced in OCLC or at auction. Brown University holds a similar broadside for the organization's 1813 celebration in Springfield, MA, with different odes. "
