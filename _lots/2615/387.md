FOOTNOTE: "Charlotte Ordway Biggs (1807-1889) grew up in Maine and married a textile mechanic. In 1833, he was hired to go to Mexico City to set up and operate a boatload of cotton machinery. This very long letter, written to a long-lost childhood friend, is basically an autobiography of hardship and tragedy. <br><br>She describes arrival in Veracruz during a plague: \"They kept us several days in quarantine nearly roasting us alive and then suffered us to go ashore into the midst of the black vomit. <br><br>Political upheaval: \"Santa Anna had just come to power. Every city in the union was in a state of revolt. Mexico was filled with his troops, all the principal streets barocaded and canon planted in every direction.\" <br><br>Unemployment: \"The company that brought us out had become bankrupt and we could not get a dollar from them . . . surrounded by a strange race of people, could not speak their language nor make ourselves understood, and destitute of the means of support.\" They stayed for a year in the American consul's hacienda, living on his charity. <br><br>Next came embezzlement by a business partner, after the cotton machinery was finally put to use, when they \"took in a third partner who proved a perfect swindler. He cheated them out of nearly all they had made.\" <br><br>Then her husband's illness after running a cotton gin on Mexico's Pacific Coast: \"He took very sick with the coast fever which came near ending his career. When he left home he weighed 160 lbs and when he returned he weighed but 96.\"<br><br>The Biggs family by now included 8 children, and they sought \"the bennifit of an English education which we could not do thare amogst a set of Catholicks whare no other religion is tolerated.\" After saving $6,000 in ten years, they returned to America, hoping to buy a farm. However, her husband became distracted on their journey by the offer of an old grist mill in Illinois, on which he spent all their savings. The mill soon washed out in a freshet, and after it was rebuilt, their eldest son was killed in the mill machinery. Mr. Biggs was so distraught that he died just 4 weeks later, leaving Charlotte with no income and 7 children to raise. She eked out a meager existence running a boarding house in Oquawka, IL, with other deaths and hardships along the way. She concludes: \"When I was born, my destiny was marked out. I was poor then, and shall remain so to the end of the chapter.\" "
