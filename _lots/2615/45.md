FOOTNOTE: "Ko K'un-hua (1838-1882) was brought to Harvard in 1879, in the hopes that he could train a generation of students for success as China merchants. Enrollment in his classes was modest, with only 4 or 5 pupils. He died of pneumonia after almost 3 years at Harvard. The books he brought with him were Harvard's first in any Asian language, and formed the initial core of what became the Harvard-Yenching Library. After his death, Harvard offered no further instruction in Chinese for nearly 40 years. "
