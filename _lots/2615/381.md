FOOTNOTE: "Paredes was a conservative general who had assumed the presidency by coup shortly before the Mexican-American War, resigned in July 1846, and went briefly into exile. Here, three months after Mexico's formal surrender by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, he attempts to rally support for continued resistance to the punitive terms, asserting (in translation) that the treaty \"makes a vain illusion of the independence that our forebears conquered with their blood. This situation is too humiliating and violent to be tolerated by the Mexicans who are accustomed to the pleasures of liberty and complete independence from foreign nations. Our nation will not accept this offense for very long.\" In a separate document not offered here, a group of army officers in Guanajuato led by Nicolás Flores endorsed this plan two days later. <br><br>None traced at auction, in Palau, or in OCLC. The text otherwise scarcely appeared in print before 1900, and is even now rarely seen. "
