FOOTNOTE: "Franklin's contribution is headed \"An Address to the Public, from the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery, and the Relief of Free Negroes, Unlawfully Held in Bondage.\" This address considers the challenges faced by those manumitted from slavery, noting that \"he is chiefly governed by the passion of fear. He is poor and friendless--perhaps worn out by extreme labour, age and disease. . . . As far as we contribute to promote this emancipation, so far that attention is evidently a serious duty, incumbent on us.\" It is signed in type by \"B. Franklin, President.\" This address is followed by a four-point \"Plan for Improving the Condition of the Free Blacks\" (pages 383-385). Other highlights include a New York article on \"Education of Negro Children.\"  "
