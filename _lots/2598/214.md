FOOTNOTE: "These photographs were taken during the Newark riots of 12 to 17 July 1967, for use in the Life Magazine issue of 28 July 1967, titled \"Shooting War in the Streets. Newark: The Predictable Insurrection.\" One is a Bud Lee photograph of a 12-year-old boy named Joe Bass bleeding on the street from a crossfire shotgun wound (published on page 23, a variant of the magazine's haunting and controversial cover image). Another is a Frank Dandridge shot of a suspect with his hands against the wall of a gas station, held at bayonet point by a policeman (a variant of the image on page 26). The last, by Jim Pickerell, is a chaotic dimly lit street scene of police arresting several young men (published on pages 18-19 of the magazine). Each print was produced by Life Magazine for \"non-exclusive editorial use in Report of the New Jersey Select Comm. for the Study of Civil Disorder.\"  "
