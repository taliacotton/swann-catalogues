In this letter, he addresses a proposal for a United States of Africa: \"Such a union would be unrealistic and would not meet the demand of present trends in Africa considering the differences in cultures, political outlook, the traditional and economic systems of the various African peoples. . . . A union based upon treaties and conventions of friendship, economic co-operation and other joint efforts might provide a sounder solution to the problems of Africa; we have therefore suggested the Associated States of Africa for the kind of union best suited to African States.\" <br><br>WITH--3 stamps commemorating Tubman's presidency, 1968-1969; and a newspaper clipping showing Tubman meeting Queen Elizabeth on a state visit to London.
