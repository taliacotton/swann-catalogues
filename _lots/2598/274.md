FOOTNOTE: "The Menelek Club, named after an emperor of Ethiopia, had a short window as the center of Louisville's high society. Its formal opening was on 1 July 1926, and it was frequently discussed in the \"Louisville's Elite\" column of the Pittsburgh Courier for the next three years. On 22 January 1927, they announced that \"the Menelek Club is rapidly becoming the social center of many of the prominent young men of Louisville.\" On 7 September 1929, they held a \"grand reception and ball\" and \"the name Menelek Club like a magnet attracted the elite from far and near.\" We find only one mention of the club's activities after the Great Depression hit in October 1929, when they hosted a dinner for the Kentucky Negro Education Association in 1932.
