FOOTNOTE: 'Thurgood Marshall first came to national prominence in 1940 as the founder
  and executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. In this
  role, he litigated Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, with fellow NAACP lawyer
  Jack Greenberg (1924-2016) as his co-counsel. In 1961, Marshall stepped down from
  the Legal Defense Fund to accept a position as a federal judge, and Greenberg followed
  in his footsteps as the new executive director. Marshall inscribed this portrait
  to Greenberg at the time he stepped down. Although the two had worked very closely
  together, they had minimal contact after 1961, as Marshall avoided socializing with
  any of his old legal colleagues to avoid any perception of a conflict of interest.
  This photograph hung in Greenberg''s Legal Defense Fund office for 23 years, and
  then at his Columbia office until his retirement. It was said to be "perhaps the
  only material object he valued for sentimental reasons." It is described in William
  Cole''s "A Jack Greenberg Lexicon," page 132. Provenance: consigned by Jack Greenberg''s
  adopted son William Cole.  '
