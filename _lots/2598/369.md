  sportswriters. Typical articles included "Will a Negro Ever Become Manager in the
  Big Leagues?", Roger Kahn''s "What White Big Leaguers Really Think of Negro Players",
  and Jackie Robinson''s own "Jackie Climbs out on a Limb," in which he predicts his
  own Brooklyn Dodgers to repeat as National League champs (they did). Toni Stone,
  the Negro Leagues'' first female baseball player, is profiled in the first issue,
  page 15. Featured on the covers are 4 baseball players (Larry Doby, Monte Irvin,
  Minnie Miñoso, and Satchel Paige), plus football player George Taliaferro, the first
  African American drafted by the NFL. "All issues are quite scarce. Complete runs
  are virtually unknown"--Lomazow, American Periodicals, 2005 Supplement, S468.  '
