FOOTNOTE: 'This archive helps tell the story of the great jazz trumpeter and vocalist
  Louis Armstrong (1901-1971). It was collected by his longtime personal physician
  and close associate Dr. Alexander Schiff (1899-1990), who accompanied Armstrong
  on tour through most of the 1960s. <br><br>Most notable in this lot are a group
  of Armstrong''s typescript memoirs. "Satchmo in Hawaii" is an original typescript
  in 22 single-spaced pages, signed by Armstrong at the end, with his initials on
  every page. The first 8 pages are on yellow "Satchmo" letterhead, and the remainder
  on mismatched plain sheets, the whole bound in one corner with a tied rubber band.
  It was written on 5 March 1952, and begins with a gig in Sacramento''s Clayton Club
  [24 February 1952]. It recounts every detail of the ensuing week-long tour of Hawaii,
  commenting on other jazz players he hears there, every enormous meal he eats, every
  radio interview. His process is explained on page 16: "I sit here listening to my
  tape recorder, which I usually keep going constantly while I''m writing." He signs
  it "Am red beans and ricely yours, Louis Armstrong." <br><br>Two shorter memoirs
  appear to be carbon copies, and are not signed. "The Roaring Twenties, Chicago,
  Ill." is 9 pages, with several inked notes and corrections, covering events from
  his early career in 1922. "The Satchmo Story" is 10 pages, also with numerous corrections,
  covering his time in Chicago in 1931, ranging from his fondness for marijuana to
  the health problems which afflicted trombonist Jimmy Harrison. This one is accompanied
  by a torn and stained 10 December 1954 letter signed by Armstrong to agent Joe Glaser:
  "I am sending this part of the story in now as I think it is important." Finally,
  a pair of "Recordio-Disc" home-recorded 45-rpm phonograph records has "Armstrong''s
  Story as read by Lucille Armstrong," recorded in Washington on 31 October 1950 and
  sent to agent Glaser. The memoirs appear to be unpublished, and we trace no other
  examples of the "Roaring Twenties." <br><br>One other item is signed by Armstrong,
  a contract arranged by Associated Booking Corporation for a 4-week tour in Germany
  and Czechoslovakia in 1965. Armstrong signed both the one-page contract and the
  final page of the 3-page typed rider. <br><br>Photographs include a packet of 23
  snapshots from a Japanese tour, most 6½ x 4¾ inches and most depicting Armstrong;
  an 8 x 10-inch shot of Armstrong and his entourage dining at the Empire Room in
  Chicago; 14 8 x 10-inch publicity photographs (some duplicates); and an 8 x 10 shot
  of Armstrong and friends at the Mr. President Hotel in Grand Rapids, MI. <br><br>A
  folder of correspondence and memoranda, 1951-1969 (29 items) is mostly directed
  to Armstrong''s physician Alexander Schiff, and largely relates to Armstrong tour
  arrangements and medical treatment, but sometimes extends into creative territory.
  Highlights include a 1951 film pitch for "The Louis Armstrong Story"; 1959 cameraman''s
  report on filming "Louis Armstrong in the Holy Land"; and letters arranging a 1960
  African tour. Agent Joe Glaser, a frequent correspondent, wrote to the doctor on
  2 January 1968: "See that Louis rehearses a couple of those new songs and gets ready
  to do them on the Hollywood Place show, because I don''t want him to repeat anything."
  Another thick folder of tour calendars and itineraries (40 items) in a variety of
  formats is dated 1959-1970. <br><br>Printed ephemera includes 9 programs from Armstrong
  events, 1965-1970; Down Beat Magazine''s "Salute to Satch" from 1965; and postcards
  from resort appearances (including some duplicates). More unusual is a German medical
  article offprint from 1961 describing dental treatment for horn players. <br><br>Provenance:
  collected by Dr. Alexander Schiff, and then by gift to the consignor.  '
