FOOTNOTE: "Here we meet the real-life versions of \"Rosie the Riveter.\" Two of these photographs were taken at the North American Aviation plant in Kansas City, KS. One has an attached caption reading \"Eula D. Smith and Alice L. Jones are shown doing precision finishing work with air screw hammers on a sub-assembly of a B-25\" and the other reads on verso \"Former school teacher Martha Lolles, left & Iris A. Mahone install a de-icer boot on the wing of a B-25.\" Both of these photographs were published in a spread on war work in the Pittsburgh Courier, 30 January 1943. The third photograph is captioned more simply \"Negro women welders at work in the shipfitter shop.\" It was later published in the April 1945 pamphlet \"Negro Women War Workers\"--a copy of the page is included, credited to the United States Navy.
