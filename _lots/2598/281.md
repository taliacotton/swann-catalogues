TYPESET: "7 photographs (including one duplicate), each 8 x 10 inches, with inked stamps of photographer A. Bruce Goldman and short pencil captions on verso; crop marks on one print, otherwise minor wear."
FOOTNOTE: "These photographs were taken just before the climax of the Albany Movement, Dr. King's campaign to bring racial justice to the town of Albany, GA. Dozens of Jewish and Protestant clergymen from across the country gathered to hear King speak, After this gathering, they held a prayer vigil at Albany's city hall, which led to their arrest. <br><br>One of these photographs (marked with crop marks for use by the Village Voice of New York) shows King alone at the pulpit. Another (also present in duplicate) shows King at the pulpit with others as the clergymen bow their heads in prayer. Another shows the movement's local leader, Dr. William Gilchrist Anderson, seated alone by the church organ. One shows a group of 4 singers, and one pans over the solemn congregation. Finally, one shows a police car parked in front of the city hall where the vigil and arrests would soon take place. <br><br>These photographs were taken at Albany's Bethel A.M.E. Church by A. Bruce Goldman (1935-2020), a rabbi and accomplished amateur photographer from Paramus, NJ who went to Albany on 26 August and was one of 69 clergymen arrested on 28 August, spending 3 days in jail. Three of his photographs from his trip (although none of the present group) appeared in the Hackensack (NJ) Record of 5 September 1962. One of them showing King at Shiloh in the same white tie is captioned \"King addresses clergymen before they marched to City Hall where they were arrested.\" Goldman's account of these events was published as \"Quest for Freedom in Albany's Jails\" in the 4 October 1962 Village Voice, and later gathered in the Village Voice Anthology (1982), pages 21-24.
