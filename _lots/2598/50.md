Lowell's previously published \"Are Ye Truly Free?\" also appears on pages 126-127, credited. Other poets whose work appears here include John Greenleaf Whittier, Henry W. Longfellow, and Lydia Sigourney; two are from Jesse Hutchinson of the famed Hutchinson Family Singers. Two songs are credited to unnamed enslaved people: \"Song of the Coffle Gang . . . Words by the Slaves\" and \"Stolen We Were, Words by a Colored Man.\" Afro-Americana 2345; Sabin 13289. We trace none of any edition at auction since another first edition appeared in 1924. <br><br>Provenance: original owner George Washington Reynolds (1818-1895), an abolitionist editor and bookseller of Franklin, NY, who signed the title page; sold the following year to Avery T.
