FOOTNOTE: "5 photographs from early in the career of the noted actor-singer-comedian-dancer-producer. <br><br>Two shots of Vice President Richard Nixon with the Will Mastin vaudeville trio (Sammy Davis Sr., Sammy Davis Jr., and Will Mastin) at the Copacabana, New York, 1954. In one, they are joined by Mrs. Nixon and bandleader Nat Brandywynne. Davis and Nixon became longtime friends; Davis became the first Black man to stay at the White House as an invited guest in 1973. Both are captioned on verso with inked credit stamps of Jess Rand, press agent of Davis, who is believed to be the photographer. <br><br>Davis posing at a Circus Saints & Sinners event, Waldorf Astoria, with fellow tapdancer Howard \"Sandman\" Sims and female impersonator Erica Weil, New York, circa late 1950s. <br><br>Davis and his first wife Loray White Davis, and his fellow Rat Packer Frank Sinatra, credited to photographer B.C. Mittleman. Davis had been dating white actress Kim Novak, which drew threats of mob violence. To continue his career safely, he paid Loray White a large sum to participate in a sham marriage, under the agreement that it would be soon dissolved. Davis's press agent Jess Rand has appended a later note on the circumstances of this photo: \"Perhaps the only time S.D. & Loray were seen in public (excluding wedding). He took her out once. They never talked to each other or lived with each other from day 1 of marriage. I drove her to party & took her home. Sammy had to make that one public appearance.\" Hollywood, CA, \"1955\" [1958]. <br><br>Publicity still for his 1968 film \"Salt and Pepper,\" 7 August 1967.  "
