FOOTNOTE: 'Third edition, second state--bound and issued by Douglass at his press--and
  one of the few instances of a book''s later edition being more important than the
  first. Late in 1847, not long after returning from his period of English exile,
  Frederick Douglass moved from Boston to upstate New York and began publishing his
  own newspaper, to be called the "North Star." He brought with him some loose printed
  sheets of the Boston Anti-Slavery Society''s 1847 third edition of his Narrative.
  Once established in Rochester, he had them bound up as they are here, with the North
  Star imprint. We have traced no copies of the North Star binding with the frontispiece
  plate found in the Boston first issue; Douglass apparently did not bring the engravings
  along with the text sheets. <br><br>The original owner of this copy, Daniel McWilliams
  of Rochester, signed and inscribed it in 1850. This appears to be the Daniel McWilliams
  (1820-1883), born in Scotland, who was listed as a tinman in the 1851 Rochester
  directory, was in the 1860 census in nearby Albion as a tinsmith, and wrote a serialized
  memoir for the Neighbor''s Home Mail in 1874, "An Autobiography: How I Became a
  Drunkard." In the June 1874 installment (page 107), he discusses his time in Rochester
  and working in a tin shop, although he does not mention any connection to the abolitionist
  movement. Nor can we guess why he decorated both pastedowns with crude sketches
  of hands. He died in East Bloomfield, NY. <br><br>This Rochester issue is believed
  to be the only book Douglass ever issued from his own press, and this is by far
  the finest of the six examples we have traced at auction.  '
