FOOTNOTE: "These posters were issued in support of the desegregation of Boston public schools, which sparked anti-busing protests in the mid-1970s. One of these posters, headed \"200 Years of Racism is Enough!\", features the most famous image from the crisis, Stanley Foreman's photograph generally known as \"The Soiling of Old Glory,\" in which a protester swings an American flag at a Black lawyer who happened to be walking by. The photograph was the subject of a 2008 book by Louis Masur. The other two posters are titled \"Desegregate the Schools!\" and \"Join the Fight against Racism!\" (featuring a photograph of anti-segregation protesters). Each poster also features a pitch for the Socialist Workers Party ticket in the 1976 presidential race, Peter Camejo and Willie Mae Reid.  "
