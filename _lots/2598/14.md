FOOTNOTE: 'Wilson Chinn is depicted with instruments of torture used to punish enslaved
  people, including shackles, a nail-studded paddle, and a brutal spiked collar. This
  was part of a small series of disturbing images which were produced to raise funds,
  as stated on verso: "The nett proceeds from the sale of these Photographs will be
  devoted exclusively to the education of colored people in the Department of the
  Gulf, now under the command of Maj. Gen. Banks." <br><br>Wilson Chinn was born into
  slavery in Kentucky circa 1803, and then sold as a young man to a particularly brutal
  sugar planter near New Orleans. Chinn and many of his compatriots were branded with
  the owner''s "V.B.M." initials--some of them including Chinn on their foreheads.
  After the Union troops arrived, Chinn and several other New Orleans freedmen went
  north to help publicize the abolitionist cause. A group engraving with biographical
  information on Chinn appeared in Harper''s Weekly on 30 January 1864. <br><br>This
  is the less well-known image of Chinn wearing this collar; he also posed facing
  the camera in an image credited to Myron Kimball. We trace only two other examples
  of the present image in institutions, at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, and
  at the University of Maryland in Baltimore County.<br><br>WITH--carte-de-visites
  3, 4, and 5 from the same series: "Charley," "Rebecca, Charlie & Rosa," and "Oh!
  How I Love the Old Flag. Rebecca, a Slave Girl from New Orleans," all depicting
  light-skinned children freed from slavery, and crediting Paxson as photographer.
  All are inserted into their original album, with a Christmas 1865 gift inscription.  '
