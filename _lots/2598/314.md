FOOTNOTE: "Nick Biddle (1796-1876) was a formerly enslaved man of Pottsville, PA who was an unofficial member of the town's militia company. They were one of five companies summoned as the \"First Defenders\" of Washington after the fall of Fort Sumter. In Baltimore, they were met by secessionist rioters who singled out Biddle for his race and wounded him badly with a brick. He is often regarded as the first man wounded in combat for the Union. He was also almost certainly the first Black man in uniform with the Union Army during the Civil War. Here, decades after the war, the all-white First Defenders Association chose to honor Biddle for his important role. No other examples traced.  "
