FOOTNOTE: 'First edition, second printing. The author Octavia V. Rogers Albert (1853-1889)
  was born into slavery in Georgia, attended Atlanta University, married a fellow
  educator, and moved to Houma, Louisiana. There she interviewed several formerly
  enslaved people about their experiences, and crafted it into this narrative. It
  was published shortly after her untimely death. <br><br>The 1988 Oxford University
  Press edition of House of Bondage describes it as "experimental in its attempt to
  blend an interview format with slave narratives, biographical accounts, historical
  information, and even her own personal commentary . . . an example of the black
  oral tradition in process. The reader becomes an eye-witness to black culture and
  history in formation. . . . Albert skillfully moves the dialogue between the black
  vernacular of the slaves and the standard English of the black middle-class narrator."
