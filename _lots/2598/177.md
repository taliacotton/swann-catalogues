FOOTNOTE: "Jack Greenberg (1924-2016) received his Bachelor of Laws degree from Columbia in 1948, and the following year joined the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund as its only white counsel. Working under the fund's founder Thurgood Marshall, he helped argue numerous civil rights cases before the Supreme Court and elsewhere, most notably Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. In 1961, when Marshall became a federal judge, Greenberg assumed the leadership of the Legal Defense and Educational Fund, where he continued to play a key role in the civil rights movement's legal efforts for 23 more years. After 1984, he served as a dean and professor at Columbia, and in 2003 was named as #16 on the list of the 250 greatest Columbia alumni of all time.
