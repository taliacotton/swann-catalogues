FOOTNOTE: "Wentworth Cheswell (1746-1817) was the grandson of an African-American who had been freed from slavery, in addition to his three-quarters European ancestry. He went on to a successful career in Newmarket, NH as a teacher, farmer, and clerk. At the outbreak of the Revolution, he rode to the colonial capital to convey Paul Revere's warning, and then served for two years in a New Hampshire regiment. In his lifetime, he was variously described as white, yellow, or mulatto; he is now generally regarded as the first African-American to hold elected office. He was regularly elected by his townsmen to the offices of constable, selectman, auditor, and other positions from 1768 until his death. Cheswell was elected as a Justice of the Peace for Rockingham County, NH in 1805. <br><br>This document is a writ issued by Cheswell for the sheriff to collect a debt owed by Richard Hilton of Newmarket, NH. If Hilton failed to cover the debt, Cheswell authorized the sheriff \"to take the body of the said Hilton and him commit unto our Jail.\" The debt was settled two months later. Cheswell was probably the only man of acknowledged African ancestry to routinely wield this level of legal authority in America during this period. Macon Bolling Allen, often mistakenly called the first Black justice of the peace, was not elected until 1844. "
