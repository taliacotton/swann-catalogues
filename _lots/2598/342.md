FOOTNOTE: "The \"Yale Sweeps\" were Yale University's all-Black custodial force in the 19th century, with a place in college lore, and often occupying a substantial position in the local community due to their connection with the school. Of the men shown here, Carter Wright was the son of an A.M.E. minister who had served as a chaplain in the Civil War. George T. Livingston had served in the 29th Connecticut Infantry during the war, was active in Republican politics, and served as a deacon of his church. See Charles E. Warner, Jr.'s article on the Sweeps in the Yale & Slavery Research Project.  "
