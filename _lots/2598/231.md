College, V.O.C. 41-43\"; some photographs removed, a few leaves slightly brittle, but generally an attractive, tidy, and well-preserved presentation."
FOOTNOTE: "This scrapbook was kept by Virginia Omega Collier (1919-2016) of Plainfield NJ, daughter of a blind A.M.E. pastor. She enrolled at North Carolina's Shaw College in 1938 and then attended North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University from 1941 to 1943. She acquired this album in 1941, but included family photographs going back as early as 1936. It is a well-curated compendium of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority sisters, students in science lab, vacations on the Jersey Shore, soldiers on leave, and homecoming floats. Ephemera includes a program for her cousin Vivian Collier, \"Colored Soprano,\" at Manhattan's Town Hall, 1942; and a portrait of George Washington Carver. Clippings document her sister Elouise's admittance as the second Black student at the Yale School of Nursing, and community recognition of her father's long service as a clergyman.  "
