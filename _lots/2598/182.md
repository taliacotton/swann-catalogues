FOOTNOTE: 'First edition of King''s reflections on his 1963 Birmingham campaign, including
  the text of his "Letter from Birmingham Jail." He inscribed this copy "to my good
  friend Jack Greenberg, in appreciation for tremendous legal ability, your genuine
  humanitarian concern, and your unswerving devotion to the principles of freedom
  and justice, Martin." <br><br>Jack Greenberg (1924-2016) was the longtime head of
  the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which provided legal assistance to
  Dr. King on a regular basis, including on the Birmingham campaign. As King recounts
  in Why We Can''t Wait, after Birmingham''s school system had suspended more than
  a thousand demonstrators from their schools, on 22 May 1963, "we decided to take
  the issue into the courts and did so, through the auspices of the N.A.A.C.P. Legal
  Defense and Educational Fund. . . . The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals . . . strongly
  condemned the Board of Education for its action. . . . It was a jubilant moment,
  another victory in the titanic struggle. The following day, in an appropriate postscript,
  the Alabama Supreme Court ruled Eugene ''Bull'' Connor and his fellow commissioners
  out of office, once and for all" (pages 115-116). Greenberg and the Legal Defense
  Fund represented King while he was in the Birmingham Jail and helped secure his
  release. A year after Why We Can''t Wait was published, Greenberg and three Legal
  Defense Fund colleagues drafted the route for the famed march from Selma to Montgomery
  and filed the plan with the State of Alabama. <br><br>Provenance: consigned by Jack
  Greenberg''s adopted son William Cole.  '
