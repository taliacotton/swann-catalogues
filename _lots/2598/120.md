FOOTNOTE: "This protest was planned to coincide with a massive anti-war demonstration, which drew 250,000 protestors. As noted in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch of 16 November 1969, \"A permit had been obtained for a later rally at the Justice Department . . . to protest against the Chicago conspiracy trial. The rally never took place. The protest leaders did not show up. Instead, several thousand youths led by a small contingent wearing motorcycle helmets, carrying Viet Cong flags and red banners massed at the high iron doors of the Justice Department and began hurling bottles and stones through windows. They chanted 'Free Bobby Seale' and 'Stop the trial.'\" <br><br>Provenance: offered with a long note by the original owner to the present consignor (neither named): \"It was handed to me when I was a grad student at GWU in DC. . . . I went to some rallies against the war. . . . I found it recently in an old Brit Lit textbook. We were young then and now we're not! . . . We remember well the trials.\" 21 January 2020.  "
