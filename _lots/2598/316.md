The regiment's officers including the doomed Colonel Robert G. Shaw are listed, and \"in Essex Street, a lady presented Col. Shaw with a handsome bouquet.\" <br><br>Among the other articles in this issue are a speech by Wendell Phillips, a report on the New England Anti-Slavery Convention, an article on the recruitment of the 55th Massachusetts regiment, and the publication of a new map of Charleston Harbor, where the 54th was heading for their meeting with history at Fort Wagner.
