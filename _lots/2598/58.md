FOOTNOTE: "An eye-catching display of 28 bar graphs demonstrating the economic and cultural superiority of the free states over the slave states, for those unmoved by moral arguments against slavery. Expressed in percentage ratios, we see that the slave states had many fewer schools, newspapers, libraries, enrolled militia, wealth (even including slaves), railroads, exports, and even cotton manufacturing capacity. A reference to the \"seven seceding states\" places the composition after Texas (23 February) and before Virginia (17 April). The number of slaveholders benefitting from the institution is shown to be much smaller than the population of New York City. Afro-Americana 959; Sabin 3908.  "
