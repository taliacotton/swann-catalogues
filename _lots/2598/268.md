FOOTNOTE: "The Hyers family were groundbreaking figures who brought Black musical theater to the general public. Singing and acting sisters Anna Madah Hyers and Emma Louise Hyers were managed by their father Samuel B. Hyers. \"Out of Bondage\" was their best-known production, a story of slavery and emancipation with a Black cast--here including the important actor Sam Lucas. This independently produced playbill offers an act-by-act synopsis of the plot for Out of Bondage and a full cast list, with numerous local advertisements, and the bill for an unrelated play on verso.
