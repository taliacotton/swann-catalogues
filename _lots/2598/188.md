FOOTNOTE: "The railroad provided service between Santa Fe, NM and Galveston, TX, connecting many smaller Texas towns to the state's largest port city. This blueprint was created to standardize their signage; it is captioned \"Standard Depot Details, Letters for Depot Gables, Bulletin Board and Waiting Room Signs.\"<br><br>Some of the company's stations were apparently unsegregated (perhaps in New Mexico?), so a simple \"Waiting Room\" sign would do. For the segregated stations in Texas, the lettering of the \"White Waiting Room\" and \"Colored Waiting Room\" signs is specified, each with the line's distinctive \"Santa Fe\" logo. The exact paint for background and lettering is specified in a memo.  "
