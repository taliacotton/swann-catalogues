FOOTNOTE: "The founding report of what became the National Urban League. <br><br>This organization was founded in October 1911 as a merger between three existing civil rights organizations (it assumed its present National Urban League name in 1920). This report describes the joining of the three organizations, and offers a \"plan of work\" for 1912, most notably \"constructive and preventative social work for improving the social and economic conditions among Negroes in urban centers.\" The sociologist George Edmund Haynes is named as the organization's first director. Reports and budgets for the three constituent organizations are also included. As the report is prefaced by a 28 October 1911 quotation and mentions plans for an upcoming 4 December conference of social workers, it was likely printed in November 1911. None others traced at auction, and none identified in OCLC, although one might still be found in a run of Urban League reports.  "
