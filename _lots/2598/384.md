FOOTNOTE: 'Anna Julia Haywood Cooper (1858-1964) was born into slavery, spent her
  early years in Raleigh, NC, graduated from Oberlin College in 1884, and earned a
  master''s degree in mathematics there four years later--one of the first two Black
  women in America to earn the M.A. She moved to Washington, where she helped found
  the Colored Women''s League. "A Voice from the South," her first book, was an important
  early expression of Black feminism, arguing that womanhood was "a vital element
  in the regeneration and progress of a race," and that higher education was the means
  of reaching that goal. <br><br>Cooper received her doctorate degree from the Sorbonne
  in Paris in 1924, at the age of 66--and lived for another four decades. Afro-Americana
