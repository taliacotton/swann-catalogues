FOOTNOTE: "In August 1974, Joan Little was serving a sentence at Beaufort County Jail in North Carolina. A notoriously predatory prison guard attempted to rape her, and she stabbed him to death with an ice pick. Facing the death penalty, her case became a national cause at the intersection of the feminist, racial justice, and prison reform movements. Rosa Parks and the local Black Panther Party chapter were among the thousands who worked in her defense. In August 1975, she became the first woman in American history to be acquitted of murder in self-defense against sexual assault. None traced at auction. "
