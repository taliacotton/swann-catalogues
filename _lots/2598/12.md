DESCRIPT: " Dinah Browning."
CROSSHEAD: "An enslaved woman's letter to her former master."
at-a-glance: "Columbia, AR, 2 May 1858"
TYPESET: "Manuscript letter to John Browning on one page, 9¾ x 7¾ inches; lacking integral blank, minor foxing and wear."
FOOTNOTE: "Browning writes from Columbia, a fading Mississippi River town in southeastern Arkansas near the Louisiana and Mississippi lines (it was abandoned to river erosion in the 1870s). The letter is written in a tidy, educated hand, which would be remarkable for an enslaved person--or possibly the letter was written out at her request by her new owner. <br><br>The first part of the letter makes a simple request of her former owner John Browning: \"My dear master, You will confer a favour on me by handing this letter to Mr. Levi Sykes and his sister Polly, and you will confer a favour on your old servant, Dinah Browning.\" <br><br>The remainder of the letter is addressed to \"Mr. Levi Sikes & Miss Mary Sykes\": \"My dear master & mistress, I am now settled, also Daniel who is with me. I like the country very well, but have not had very good health. Neither has Daniel. We are on a cotton plantation in Arks., four miles above Columbia on the Mississippi River & belong to Samuel R. Walker. I would like that Miss Polly would see that Mr. Vincent Browning delivers over the things that I left with him to my son Lemick. You will please write me so soon as you receive this, address to the care of Mr. Samuel R. Walker. . . . Please say how my sister is, & my husband's brother, also all the balance of my acquaintances. I have had no trouble, only sickness. I have no room to complain of my living at all. Respectfully, Dinah Browning.\" <br><br>The persons named from her old life can all be found in the 1850 or 1860 census of Russell County, in the western part of Virginia. John Browning (1793-1878) was a fairly well-off planter, as was his son Vincent Browning (1821-1865). Levi Sykes (1807-1860) is listed in 1850 as a white farmer with no real estate; his son was a laborer. He was quite possibly an overseer or farmhand for the Brownings. His sister Polly Sykes (1812-1878) had a modest $1000 of property in the 1860 census. The slave schedules for 1850 note 6 enslaved people in John Browning's possession, but just one adult--a 24-year-old mulatto woman, quite possibly Dinah. That matches with one of the 11 enslaved people listed for Samuel R. Walker in the 1860 census, a 35-year-old woman. We have been unable to trace Dinah Browning's life after emancipation.  "
