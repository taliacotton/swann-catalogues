DESCRIPT: ''
CROSSHEAD: Bill of lading for a very early shipment of "two negroes" from Jamaica
  to Boston.
at-a-glance: Jamaica, 3 March 1708/9
TYPESET: Partly printed document, 4¾ x 8¼ inches, signed by Jeffrey Bedgood as ship's
  master; vertical fold, uncut, minor foxing and wear, unrelated calculation on verso.
FOOTNOTE: ' By the brigantine Mary under master Jeffrey Bedgood, Thomas Hall shipped
  "two negroes, one man & one woman" from Bluefields, Jamaica to Boston, agreeing
  to freight costs of £3 for each. The North American slave trade dates back to 1619,
  but in 1709 it was still substantially smaller and less organized than it would
  be even by the mid-1700s. We can find no manuscripts from this period of the North
  American trade at auction through Swann. Dartmouth College holds a similar bill
  of lading signed by Bedgood dated 1718. No voyages for any vessels under Captain
  Bedgood are recorded in the SlaveVoyages database.  '
