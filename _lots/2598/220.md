TYPESET: "Portrait plates of the murderer and his victim. 23 pages. 8vo, original printed wrappers, with rusty staples, dampstaining, and crude tape repairs; moderate dampstaining and wear to contents."
FOOTNOTE: "In the course of this lengthy testimony, a Black man confesses to the killing of a drunk during a botched robbery, and explains the sordid life of crime in Schoharie, NY which led him to that point. Several murders are described beyond the one he was convicted for, including two of his officers in the 20th United States Colored Troops during the Civil War. While Steenburgh's story is not uplifting in any way, the rich background detail on Black life in small upstate New York towns makes for interesting reading. McDade 907; none traced at auction.  "
