FOOTNOTE: "Today's Black Caucus at Pennsylvania State University had its roots in the Frederick Douglass Association, which became the Black Student Union in 1969. The Black Arts Festival was their first project under the new name. Following a period of intense confrontation and demonstrations on campus, this event was intended to build bridges with appeal to both Black and White students. Entertainers included James Brown and Muddy Waters, and speaking appearances included Adam Clayton Powell, Ruby Dee, and the first Miss Black America, Saundra Williams.  "
