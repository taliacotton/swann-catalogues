at-a-glance: "Baltimore, MD: William N. Holt, circa 1913."
TYPESET: "(wrapper title). 3 portraits of Holt, his wife, and young son. [2], 25 pages. Original printed wrappers, worn, crudely restitched; leaves brittle with moderate edge wear but no loss of text, one leaf detached, bound with what appear to be an index leaf and rear wrapper from an entirely different book."
FOOTNOTE: "This collection of 23 hymns includes standards like \"Swing Low Sweet Chariot,\" others by contemporary authors, and a few credited to Holt as author, including \"Meet Me at the Pearly Gates,\" copyrighted in 1913. We can trace little information about Rev. Holt, but the Baltimore Sun of 27 January 1908 names him as minister of the Whatcoat Epworth Methodist Episcopal Church, and he preached at A.M.E. churches occasionally through at least 1929. His son William Tyler Holt was born in August 1908 per his 1940 draft registration, and appears to be about 5 years old in the photograph at the rear of this volume. We trace no other copies in OCLC or at auction.  "
