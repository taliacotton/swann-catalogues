Philip Randolph to protest segregation in the military and in defense industries. The pledge on the back of this card balances patriotism and aggressive activism: \"I support and endorse the fight of the United Nations to wipe out the Axis menace. . . . I support a non-violent but direct struggle by the Negro people to abolish segregation. . . . I am not anti-white but I believe that Negroes should initiate the campaign to win their unconditional equality of status for themselves. I will work for a Free Africa and a Free Caribbean.\" No related materials traced at auction.  "
