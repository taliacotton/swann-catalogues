A tag on the front pastedown is from an unnamed abolitionist bookseller in the famed Providence Arcade, built in 1828 as the nation's first enclosed shopping mall. It advertises \"the most valuable Anti-Slavery Books, Pamphlets, Pictures &c. . . . Immense good is done by their circulation in every family, and every cent of profit arising from the sale, goes toward the support and extension of the cause.\" Facing it on the front free endpaper is a full-page bookplate from the \"Anti-Slavery Library, belonging to the Providence Ladies . . . Anti-Slavery Societies,\" giving their 8-point conditions of membership. Pencil notes explain that the book was purchased from bookseller James Cummins for $2000 on the strength of the bookplates. <br><br>Afro-Americana 4148; Sabin 27671; Shaw & Shoemaker 37668.
