FOOTNOTE: "The Anglo-African Magazine was short-lived but included contributions from some of the nineteenth century's most important Black writers. These issues contain the first, second and fourth installments of Martin R. Delany's serialized adventure novel of slave revolts, \"Blake, or the Huts of America.\" His short scientific article on comets also appears in the February issue, as does an essay by A.M.E. bishop Daniel Payne. The first Black American pharmacist, James McCune Smith, indulges in a bit of scientific ethnic prejudice in pronouncing the massive wave of German immigration superior to the Irish in his two-part \"German Invasion\" (February and March). Other highlights include Robert Campbell on \"Struggles for Freedom in Jamaica\" in the March issue. The May issue contains two pieces by important early Black women authors: \"A Good Habit Recommended\" by Sarah Mapps Douglass and \"Our Greatest Want\" by Frances Ellen Watkins.<br><br>Provenance: Charles Hicks Bustill (circa 1815-1890) of Philadelphia, conductor on the Underground Railroad and Paul Robeson's maternal grandfather. His first cousin Sarah Mapps Douglasss was a contributor to the magazine.  "
