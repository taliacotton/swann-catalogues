FOOTNOTE: 'A collection of short biographies of formerly enslaved people, compiled
  by a white woman from Columbus, OH with strong Southern sympathies. The book is
  "illustrated from photographs made by the author in the cabins and on the plantations."
  The foreword summarizes her editorial viewpoint: "Thousands of negroes, though slaves
  no longer, lingered with their former masters, working for them and sharing their
  misfortunes. The freedom the war had brought to them was not of their seeking. .
  . . They chose to stay with those whom they had come to know as friends and protectors.
  They stayed and served with fidelity . . . and in turn were treated with the kindness,
  affection and justice that are characteristic of the Southern people." Although
  the book is essentially Confederate Lost Cause propaganda, and the narrative is
  heavily skewed toward nostalgia, the portraits and biographies may still have some
  historical value. None at auction since 2005.  '
