FOOTNOTE: 'The 66 Signs of Neon exhibition was born from the 1965 Watts Uprising.
  Sculptor Noah Purifoy found himself scavenging through the ruins of the neighborhood
  in search of fragments of accidental beauty. He came to lead a collective of like-minded
  artists who mounted an exhibition of their "junk art" in 1966, and then sent it
  on tour through 1971. This catalog, in the enigmatic spirit of the art, has no date
  or proper title, but does feature explanatory text credited to "Noah Purifoy as
  told to Ted Michel." The work displayed within is by Purifoy, Judson Powell, and
  other artists, and is the only contemporary document on this seminal exhibition.
  One copy in OCLC, at the Museum of Fine Arts Houston; none traced at auction.  '
