at-a-glance: "No place: NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, circa 1964"

FOOTNOTE: "The Civil Rights Law Institutes were held by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund from at least 1964 to 1968 as weekend training conferences for civil rights lawyers. These binders codified effective legal strategies for moving civil rights cases through the courts, and were perhaps the first systematic effort toward a methodology of civil rights litigation. They have introductions by Legal Defense Fund head Jack Greenberg. <br><br>The first two binders are titled \"Civil Rights Law Institutes: Cases and Materials.\" Greenberg credits their preparation to a team of distinguished law professors such as Marvin Frankel, Louis Henkin, Louis Pollak, Anthony Amsterdam, and more. The third binder is credited solely to Anthony G. Amsterdam, titled \"The Defensive Transfer of Civil Rights Litigation from State to Federal Courts.\" It is complete with \"Volume I\" and \"Volume II\" in one binder. The binder is undated, but this institute was discussed in the 16 December 1964 issue of the Lake Charles (LA) American-Press. It traces strategies for getting cases into federal courts where they would receive a fairer hearing and have broader impact. While some copies of these binders have been preserved in libraries, we trace none at auction. Provenance: the personal copies of Jack Greenberg, and consigned by his adopted son William Cole.  "
