FOOTNOTE: "As shown in these documents, William Howard (circa 1835-1864) was an enslaved laborer owned by the recently widowed Priscilla Ann (Jessup) Daugherty (1825-1906) of Baltimore. She manumitted him on 1 April 1864 directly into the service of the 30th United States Colored Infantry, Company I. The Emancipation Proclamation did not cover the enslaved of the northern states, although Maryland slaveowners like Daugherty could probably see the writing on the wall for the institution's future prospects. She apparently received compensation for Howard's enlistment, which is more than she would have received under emancipation. This lot includes: <br><br>\"Volunteer Descriptive List\" form documenting Howard's enlistment, dated 25 March 1864, including Daugherty's signed statement that \"the above slave is her property for life.\" <br><br>\"Evidence of Title\" form testifying that Daugherty acquired Howard as her \"slave for life\" by inheritance in 1858, with supporting statements by two witnesses, 4 pages including docket. <br><br>3 conjoined forms signed by Dougherty: a \"Claimant's Certificate\" claiming her right to compensation for Howard's enlistment; her \"Oath of Allegiance\" to the United States signed by Daugherty, to demonstrate her eligibility to receive compensation; and her pledge to file a Deed of Manumission, all dated 1 April 1864, 3 pages on one folding sheet. <br><br>\"Deed of Manumission and Release of Service\" (true copy of original deed), 14 x 8Â½ inches, full separations at folds. 4 April 1864. <br><br>Also a related deed of \"one negro boy Charles Howard\" (William's brother?) from Priscilla Jessop to Priscilla A. Jessop of Baltimore, 1846. <br><br>After his manumission, or more accurately his sale into military service, William Howard enjoyed almost 8 months of freedom in 1864, all of it spent in the Army. Records show that on 24 November, while his regiment served in the Siege of Petersburg, he died in his tent--perhaps by an artillery shell.  "
