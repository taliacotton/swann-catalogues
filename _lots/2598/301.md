It features work by Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Arthur Schomburg, Alain Locke, and W.E.B. Du Bois; essays on everyone from Phyllis Wheatley to Frederick Douglass to Josephine Baker; hard-hitting essays on the slave trade, lynching, prison labor, Scottsboro, and the Klan; a directory of \"Some Negro Slang\"; and coverage of current developments in Africa and the West Indies. A substantial portion of the original edition of 1000 are said to have been lost in a German bombing raid on London. \"Virtually unobtainable. . . .
