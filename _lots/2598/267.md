FOOTNOTE: "This production at New York's Grand Opera House featured Mr. and Mrs. George C. Howard, who were behind the original 1852 stage adaptation, and continued in their original roles as St. Clair and Topsy. <br><br>This program was printed as an issue of \"Pleasure Season: Music, Literature and the Fine Arts,\" published by J.C. Foreman. It was nominally an independent publication, and boasted of circulation at \"all the principal hotels and reading rooms\" in the New York area. This issue includes a bit of general theatrical gossip, and two short articles--one of them discussing the present Uncle Tom's production. Pleasure Season apparently existed to publish Grand Opera House programs and take in advertising revenue, similar to the modern Playbill publication. See Engle and Miller, The American Stage, page 108. This program was annotated by Cort family, who attended the performance: siblings Arthur and Jessie Cort (aged about 15 and 10) and their mother.
