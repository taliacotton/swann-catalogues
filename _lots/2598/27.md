FOOTNOTE: "This letter is literally full of more questions than answers. A Georgia slave owner named T.H. Anderson apparently hired one J.M. Askew to help transport a large number of enslaved people to Alabama, and became suspicious that Askew had somehow swindled him. Here he asks a lawyer to investigate the entire transaction thoroughly: \"What negrows were purchased with the money that said Askew was to have his wages out of? What negrows did I have on hand when I employed Askew? Name the negrows bought and on hand? . . . Was any negrows brought out to sell on commissions? . . . The boy Tom, where was he purchased? Was he not brought to Alabamia while Askew was in the prison bounds in the town of Covington? . . . Was I to have the liberty to discharg said Askew whenever he spent one dime without my consent? . . . Do you no how many trips Askew made with me, and where did I meet him? The last trip, how many negrows had I on hand when he met me, and where did we meet?\" <br><br>Then Anderson has the clever idea to ask the enslaved people to testify on the terms of the purchase: \"Do you no Ginny and Alfred and Jes state whether thay were sold on commission or bought by me to sell on ac't Askew?\" Here he notes \"Sold for Goss & Turner and myself.\" He continues: \"Do you no the negrows brought out to Alabamia of Bess H. Waren's? If so, state what terms thay were brought out? . . . . State whether I had other means imployed in the trade than the 2222 dollars? . . . . What is the usial expences on a negrow from Georgia to Alabamia when carryed by privet convayance, and what by public conveyance?\"  "
