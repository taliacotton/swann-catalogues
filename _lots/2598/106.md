FOOTNOTE: 'Banneker''s scarce first almanac. It begins with an endorsement by James
  McHenry, one of the signers of the Constitution: "Benjamin Banneker, a free Negro,
  has calculated an Almanack, for the ensuing year. . . . His father was an African,
  and his mother the offspring of African parents. . . . Whatever merit is attached
  to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. . . . I consider
  this Negro as a fresh proof that the powers of the mind are disconnected with the
  colour of the skin. . . . I cannot but wish, on this occasion, to see the Public
  patronage keep pace with my black friend''s merit." The editors add an additional
  note of support to introduce "an extraordinary Effort of Genius . . . calculated
  by a sable Descendant of Africa . . . controverting the long-established illiberal
  Prejudice against the Blacks." <br><br>Among the important dates noted in Banneker''s
  almanac are Washington''s birthday. Among the bits of information and wisdom which
  precede and follow the calendar portion, a note on page 5 reads "Needles first made
  in London, by a Negro, from Spain, in the reign of Q. Mary." Banneker sent the manuscript
  of this first almanac to Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, which began a famous
  correspondence. <br><br>The title page appears in two states; this is apparently
  the second state with the author''s name corrected from "Banniker." No others traced
  at auction since the 14 February 1985 John Howell sale, lot 42. Drake 2226; Evans
