FOOTNOTE: "The fund was launched circa 1960 to build a monument to the great educator and activist Mary McLeod Bethune (1875-1955); the National Council of Negro Women left the 1318 Vermont Avenue headquarters noted here circa 1965. The statue was unveiled by the Council in Washington in 1974, and was the first on public land in the capital to honor a Black American or a woman. It is emblazoned with the same words seen on one side of this donation box: \"I leave you love. I leave you hope. I leave you the challenge of developing confidence in one another. I leave you a thirst for education. I leave you a respect for the use of power. I leave you faith. I leave you racial dignity. I leave you a desire to live harmoniously with your fellow men. I leave you, finally, a responsibility to our young people.\"  "
