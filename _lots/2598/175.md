FOOTNOTE: "This project was the brainchild of star football player Art Powell, whose career had been curtailed by injuries. The project was initially launched in early 1969 in San Francisco, where retailers in the Black community were issued stamps featuring the image of singer James Brown, which they could give to their customers with each purchase. The loyal customers were then able to redeem a full album of 1200 stamps for a $3.00 discount. The blank pages are filled with promotional slogans for the project. See \"Retailing: Soul Stamps\" in Time Magazine, 11 July 1969. <br><br>WITH--promotional flier, 11 x 8½ inches, folds and wear: \"You Must Have a Filled Black and Brown Stamp Album to See Our Community Prosper.\" Notes that 20% of profits go to \"scholarships, research.\" Also promotes a James Brown concert at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, 20 July 1969. While the album is seen on the market, we have not encountered this flier before.  "
