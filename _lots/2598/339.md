FOOTNOTE: "The 92nd Infantry Division was formed in 1917, and reactivated as a \"colored\" unit in 1942. Part of the division, a combat team from the 370th Infantry Regiment, went overseas to fight in Italy in July 1944. The rest of the division followed them to Italy on 22 September, just 3 weeks after this newspaper was published. They were the only Black infantry division to see combat in the European theater. <br><br>This newspaper issue reports proudly on the combat team's first engagement, with a headline reading \"C.T. Battles Nazis at Arno,\" and a page 2 editorial: \"Since the announcement from Italy and General Clark's speech accepting the 92d Combat Team as a battle unit, all of us have been busting brass buttons with pride.\" Also included are a story on the newspaper's new printing press, and a slang-filled report on \"that mad series of parties the hipsters have been giving\" by a reporter dubbed The Sniper. No other issues of The Buffalo have been traced in OCLC or at auction. The Fort Huachuca Museum holds 52 issues, but not this one.  "
