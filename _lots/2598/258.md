FOOTNOTE: "An ambitious and long-forgotten composition by one of America's first great Black composers. An opera set on a post-Reconstruction Arkansas plantation, it incorporates ballet, arias, and other classical forms in addition to the ragtime which Joplin was best known for. It tells the story of a young woman struggling to free her community from ignorance and superstition. <br><br>Joplin self-published this score in 1911, but was never able to mount a full production, just a disastrous 1915 read-through, and a performance of one ballet by a school group. With his death in 1917, the work fell into near-total obscurity. During a ragtime revival in the 1970s, the score was rediscovered. The first full performance was not until 1972, long after Joplin's death; modern dance master Katherine Dunham was the director. It has been staged several times since, to glowing reviews. <br><br>This copy was a personal gift from Joplin's widow Lottie Stokes Joplin (circa 1875-1953), who remained in New York after his death. It was given to Etta Moten Barnett (1901-2004), an established singer and actress who had performed at the White House. <br><br>Only one other copy of this original score has been traced at auction, which sold at Swann on 15 February 2001, lot 290.
