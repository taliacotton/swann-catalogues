FOOTNOTE: "In 1969, Stokely Carmichael (1941-1998) moved to the Republic of Guinea and broke with the Black Panthers, taking the name Kwame Ture in 1978 as a tribute to his mentors Kwame Nkrumah and Sékou Touré. In this letter he writes: \"Africa is increasing her speed toward unification. The rising consciousness of our masses moves ever faster. Military regimes are actually finished in Africa. . . . The masses now want only one thing, an honest leader. . . . This alone is a serious blow to neo-colonialism which . . . can only depend on sustained corruption. . . . The neglect of the immaterial force . . . among Africans who as a mass are very religious, caused hesitation in accepting Marxism-Leninism from my youth. This in fact is what led me to Nkrumatism-Tureism, showing that each people must have their own ideology. . . . Africa gave birth to Judaism, stabilized Christianity, saved Islam from destruction!\" He closes with a wish for \"One unified socialist Africa.\"  "
