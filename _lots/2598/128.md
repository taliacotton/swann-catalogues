CROSSHEAD: "Group of crime scene photographs taken shortly after the killing of Chicago Black Panther leader Fred Hampton."
at-a-glance: "Chicago, 12 December 1969"
TYPESET: "13 original photographs (not wire photos), various sizes but all about 11 x 8 inches; minor wear; various newspaper morgue stamps, caption labels, notations, and later bar codes on verso."
FOOTNOTE: "These photographs were taken at the scene just eight days after the killing of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark by the Chicago police and FBI. Most show bullet-pocked doors and walls of the Panther headquarters. One shows several copies of a Black Panther \"Statement to the Black Community\" scattered on the floor, and in another, a stack of Black Panther Community News Service issues is stacked atop a folded mattress. One wall is covered with newspaper clippings about the Panthers' earlier gun battle with the police. One photo shows a scale model of the apartment set up in the state attorney's office, and another shows the apartment's exterior rear exit. <br><br>These images were taken by Chicago Tribune photographers, mostly longtime staffer James O'Leary, and apparently come from that paper's morgue. 4 of them have Tribune clippings affixed on verso to show where the photographs were published. <br><br>WITH--a later UPI Telephoto wire photo of the investigation dated 8 January 1970, from the same source.
