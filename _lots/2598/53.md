FOOTNOTE: "This letter was written from Denmark in the southeastern corner of Iowa, perhaps 25 miles from the Missouri line. The town was an active stop on the underground railroad; its cemetery was recently named to the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom in recognition of the activists buried there. This letter by a Denmark resident acknowledges the regular presence of the fugitives in his town, although he seems to be a hostile witness: \"If a nigger comes to this place he gets on to the under ground rail road mighty sudden, and the next thing he knows he is in Canada freezing to death, and I expect that is the only way to abolish slavery in the south: run them into Canada and freeze them to death.\" <br><br>The letter writer, George Clinton Hawkins (1835-1898), explained his politics earlier in the letter, viewing himself as a rare Buchanan supporter in a sea of abolitionists: \"Everybody votes the Republican ticket but me and one other fellow. I went for old Buck and he for Filmere.\"  "
