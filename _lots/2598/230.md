FOOTNOTE: "In 1831, Prudence Crandall (1803-1890) established the Canterbury Female Boarding School for the education of aristocratic girls from Connecticut and beyond. In the fall of 1832, a Black girl applied for admission to the school. Crandall consulted her Bible and decided to admit the girl, thus establishing the first integrated school in the United States. This did not last for very long, as all of the white parents quickly withdrew their daughters from the school. In April 1833, Crandall reopened for \"young Ladies and little Misses of color,\" enrolling girls from across the northeast. The next month, Connecticut passed a law in reaction forbidding the education of Black children from out of state, and in July Crandall was arrested. No examples of this trial report have been traced at auction since 1940; not in Blockson or Afro-Americana.  "
