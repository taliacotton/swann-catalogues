TYPESET: "Poster, 22½ x 17½ inches; minimal wear, small smudge in top margin."
FOOTNOTE: "On 13 January 1970, three Black inmates at Soledad Prison were shot by a prison guard for engaging in a fist-fight. The ensuing investigation exonerated the guard; within an hour, another white prison guard was killed in retaliation. Prisoners George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo and John Clutchette were charged with the murder. Their defense quickly became a popular cause in activist circles; this poster featured a quote from Ho Chi Minh's prison diary. Jackson was killed in a breakout attempt on 21 August 1971, shortly before his trial; he left his modest estate to the Black Panther Party. Drumgo and Clutchette were acquitted the following year.  "
