FOOTNOTE: "One of the most iconic images of slavery. After repeated beating and whippings at a Louisiana plantation, Gordon escaped from slavery and made his way to a Union camp at Baton Rouge, where he joined the army as a private. A camp photographer took a series of photographs which graphically demonstrated the brutality he had endured. The present photograph was the best known. It was engraved for the 4 July 1863 issue of Harper's Weekly, where it ran over the caption \"Gordon Under Medical Inspection.\" This example is on the original photographers' mount.  "
