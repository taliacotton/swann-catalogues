FOOTNOTE: "deLesseps Story \"Chep\" Morrison (1912-1964) served as a white Democratic mayor of New Orleans from 1946 to 1961. This poster was produced from a segregationist perspective in reaction to his 1950 re-election campaign, warning that he had integrated the city's auditorium and was allowing Black residents to register to vote. <br><br>This poster was probably not very effective for white supremacist purposes, as it inevitably circulated in the Black press; the Pittsburgh Courier reproduced it on 28 January 1950. The sub-headlines would have all played well in the Black community: \"Mayor of New Orleans Gives Negroes Equal Political and Social Rights\"; \"Negroes to be Placed on Police Force\"; \"Auditorium to become Negro Pleasure Set\"; \"National Negro Paper Hails Morrison.\" The large reproduction of the state's Reconstruction-era legislature would certainly evoke nostalgia among Black voters as well. Morrison did indeed win re-election, and did indeed integrate the police force that year. This poster might make you think he was a visionary crusader for civil rights, but he later spoke in favor of segregation in 1959. None in OCLC, none traced at auction.  "
