FOOTNOTE: "An early image of the armory engine house where John Brown and his men made their final stand. The fort is in its original location, and is shown before \"John Brown's Fort\" was painted above the front doors. The photographer was William Moody Chase (1817-1901). Was he being coy by not explaining the significance of this site? Or was it offered just as a view of a random building by the railroad tracks in scenic Harper's Ferry?  "
