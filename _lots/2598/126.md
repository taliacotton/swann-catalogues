Similar to a slightly smaller two-color poster sold in Swann's 7 May 2020 sale, lot 173, which lacked the contact text at bottom and referred to the \"Chicago 8\" rather than the \"Conspiracy 8,\" and featured a slightly different rendering of the same source image. The 28 East Jackson St. address given here was used by the \"Conspiracy\" legal defense fund in 1969 publications.  "
