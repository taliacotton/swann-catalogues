FOOTNOTE: "The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was formed in Oakland, CA in October 1966, and gained local attention for its armed police-monitoring patrols. The California legislature, spooked by this activity, drafted legislation to forbid carrying loaded weapons in public. On 2 May 1967, a large group of armed Black Panthers arrived at the State Capitol in Sacramento to protest the restriction of their rights. This, more than any other single event, brought the Panthers national attention. These three photographs helped tell the story. <br><br>Original photograph, 7 x 9 inches, with folding caption label tipped to verso. Shows a group of Panthers, three of them bearing rifles, in front of large oil portraits of the governors in the halls of the legislature.
