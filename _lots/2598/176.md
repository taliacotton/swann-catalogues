In a 26 September 1971 interview with the New York Daily News, co-organizer Percy Sutton (the Manhattan borough president) explained that \"Black people have learned that they cannot move America only by praying, demonstrating, sitting-in, and in the courts. Therefore, they are now focusing their attention on economics and politics.\" According to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, head of Operation Breadbasket, \"Black and minority economic, cultural, and political awareness and independence is the overriding goal of Black Expo '71\"--echoing the language on this pennant. None others traced at auction.  "
