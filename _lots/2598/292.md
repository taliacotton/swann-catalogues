FOOTNOTE: "A group portrait of an early all-Black fire company. 24 firemen and 4 officers are posed in front of Engine Company No. 30 at 1401 South Central Avenue in Los Angeles. The photograph is not captioned but the building's facade is easily recognizable, as it remains the home of the African-American Firefighter Museum today. The city's segregated fire department concentrated their growing number of Black personnel at this location in 1924, an occasion which we suspect this portrait commemorates.  "
