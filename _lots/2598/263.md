FOOTNOTE: "These tapes were purchased from the estate of the great trumpet player John Birks \"Dizzy\" Gillespie. We have not listened to them, so we can't guarantee what's on them, or their playability--we can only testify to what's written on the labels, which are enough to be quite intriguing. The lot includes 21 labelled 7-inch reel-to-reel audio tapes, with labels such as \"Part 2, Gillespie & Lombardo,\" \"Rehearsal (Woody, Chris, Rudy, Kenny) Begin the Beguine\"; \"April 21 1963, Dizzy Gillespie, A Negro Looks at Patriotism\"; \"Sonny Stitt\"; ten songs by the Trinidad calypso player Lord Melody; \"To Dizzy & Lorraine from Lucille & Satch\"; \"Woody Rehearsal\"; \"Talking with Bobby Hackett\"; \"J.P., Wes, John, Russell (baseball)\"; \"Dizzy Movie Themes\"; \"Sao Paulo 8-20-56\"; \"Aircheck--Penthouse 6-13-62\"; and \"Lalu, Chuck, Leo, Art.\" Two with water-damaged cases might still be worth a try: \"McIntosh\" (likely his 1963 collaborator, trombonist Tom McIntosh), and \"Bird.\" <br><br>Also included are 3 VHS video cassettes: \"Do I Do, featured guest artist John Gillespie\"; \"Olympic gala, Dizzy Gillespie Segment with into\" dated 4 August 1984; and a later recording of the 1967 Monterey Jazz Festival.

An additional 23 reel-to-reels in various formats are unlabeled, and might contain anything from blank static to the Dead Sea Scrolls. <br><br>Provenance: Dawson & Nye's Dizzy Gillespie estate sale, 14 September 2005 (copy of the catalog included with the lot).
