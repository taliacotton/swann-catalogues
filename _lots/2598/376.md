FOOTNOTE: "Ida B. Jefferson (born circa 1875) was an Ohio-born faith healer and evangelist who was active in Texas from at least 1900 to 1923. She is listed in the 1900 census as a widowed preacher in Schulenberg, TX, and in 1920 as an A.M.E. minister in Gregg County, TX. The Dallas Express of 27 November 1920 described her as a resident of Longview, TX and added that \"this noble woman can cure you of any disease, no matter how bad the case is.\" She ran illustrated ads across the country for her healing services and her hair restorer from 1920 to 1923. She was divorced in Los Angeles in 1924, and no later reference has been found. This card would appear to be much earlier than her 1920s advertisements, perhaps circa 1910.  "
