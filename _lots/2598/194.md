FOOTNOTE: "The journalist Henry Lee Moon (1901-1985) was a Howard University graduate who began writing for the Amsterdam News in 1931. This essay was, as far as we know, never published. It was written in the wake of the 1933 split between the NAACP and W.E.B. Du Bois, and traces the recent history of Black leadership, from the frictions between Du Bois and Booker T. Washington, to the fading influence of Marcus Garvey, to the failure of socialism and communism to make substantial inroads into the Black community. His conclusions are sympathetic toward socialism: \"The Negro's way out is the way of all labor--the socialization of industry and the resulting abolition of the competitive system upon which race hatreds flourish.\"  "
