FOOTNOTE: "Two barbers stand by two customers in their chairs, with four other customers waiting for service in the background. Two handwritten signs explain \"Full haircut 35Â¢, shave 15\" and \"No credit.\" <br><br>In the background is a poster for an upcoming baseball game between the \"N.O. St. Louis Stars\" and the Jacksonville Redcaps, placing the date of the photograph not long before Friday, 9 May 1941. The two teams faced off for opening day of the Negro American League two days later in New Orleans, so this must have been an exhibition game. The location of the game was at Hammond Ball Park, probably in Hammond, LA near New Orleans.  "
