FOOTNOTE: "This game marked the end of segregated high school football in the District of Columbia. At the conclusion of the regular season, a public high school all-star team faced off against St. John's, an elite all-white private Catholic school. Court-mandated integration had begun that year, but had not yet reached the football teams; both white and black players later recalled never having even attended an integrated practice before. The biggest future star was one of the black players, Willie Wood, a junior at Armstrong High, who went on to star for the Green Bay Packers and was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame. However, he was not the star of the game. With six minutes remaining, white tailback Dan Droze connected with black tight end Dave Harris for a touchdown, and the public school kids won 12-7. The program contains rosters and team photos for both teams. See Dave McKenna, \"Fifty-Five Years after D.C.'s First Integrated Touchdown,\" Washington City Paper, 27 November 2009.  "
