FOOTNOTE: 'A typescript of the groundbreaking play, the first by a Black woman on
  Broadway, and the first with a Black director. This copy apparently belonged to
  the Academy Award-nominated American actress Juanita Moore (1914-2014), who played
  the role of Mama Lena Younger in the Adelphi Theatre staging of the play in London.
  It opened in August 1959, a few months after the Broadway debut. Her signature appears
  above the title, along with more than a dozen other memoranda, some apparently relating
  to her efforts to find lodging in London. Elwood Smith, who was an understudy in
  the Broadway production and later played the lead as Walter Younger in the 1960
  Boston production, has added his New Orleans address as well. The script is loaded
  with manuscript notes, some of them apparently in Moore''s hand, and many of them
  relating to the character of Mama--both elaborations on the stage instructions,
  and character motivations. <br><br>WITH--3 photographs from the London production:
  one of a scene featuring cast members Olga James, Kim Hamilton, and Juanita Moore,
  shot by by Reginald Wilson of Houston Rogers Studios, 6 x 4¾ inches; one of the
  cast''s curtain call, 8 x 10 inches, by George J. Keen; and another of cast members
  Juanita Moore, Earle Hyman, Kim Hamilton, and Olga James embracing, also 8 x 10
  inches, by George J. Keen. All are housed in a worn later envelope bearing Moore''s
  address.  '
