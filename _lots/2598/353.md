FOOTNOTE: "Alfred Gescheidt. Poster, 28 x 22 inches; minor wear. Features an untitled photo-montage, elsewhere titled \"Politics Makes Strange Bedfellows\" or \"American Gothic.\" Depicts the heads of pioneering congresswoman Shirley Chisholm and notorious segregationist George Wallace grafted onto the famous Grant Wood painting. The poster is dated 1971, although you might expect it to date from the 1972 presidential campaign, when they both vied for the Democratic Party nomination; Chisholm famously visited Wallace in the hospital after an 8 June assassination attempt. New York: Yippy Inc., 1971. <br><br>\"Wallace and Carmichael for President. Oi-Vay America. Vote the Black-White Power Party for More and Better Segregation.\" Poster, 22½ x 17½ inches; moderate edge wear. Draws a dubious equivalence between Wallace's segregationism and Stokely Carmichael's Black Power activism. None traced at auction or in OCLC. No place: Poster Print, 1967.  "
