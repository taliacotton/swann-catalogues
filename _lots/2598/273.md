FOOTNOTE: "These photographs depict the family of a Black California union auto worker living the 1950s blue-collar American Dream: new cars, stylish outfits, and wholesome recreation. Several depict the compiler and his friends on hunting expeditions, posing with rifles, deer, game birds, and even a raccoon. In one image, an impeccably dressed little girl holds up the head of a deer carcass on her lawn. <br><br>4 personal documents give us the compiler's name and occupation. A 1948 hunting license places him in Richmond, CA. A 1961 interim driver's license places his residence in Oakland, and two pay stubs (1953 and undated) show him employed at the Ford Motors plant in San Jose, CA. <br><br>Laid into the rear of the volume is a 19 September 1964 strike notice for Local 560 of the United Auto Workers at the Ford plant in nearby Milpitas, CA, explaining the union's strike procedures. The national union signed a new contract that morning, averting a national strike with just 55 minutes to spare.  "
