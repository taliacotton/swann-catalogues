TYPESET: "The \"Carrizo Gorge,\" as it is more frequently spelled, is situated in the Jacumba Mountains, near San Diego. In Logan's own words, \"posters, of course, should give broad impressions rather than details, and yet the picture should depict the scene unmistakably. To do this I try to keep my values correct. First, I study the landscape until I know it intimately, sketching it exactly as it appears. After that all sorts of devices may be used to express the spirit, providing I keep the values correct. By values I mean color and outline with relation to each other rather than to the original\" (Richmond p. 70). Logan \"made increasing use of the impasto technique, applying heavy, textured swirls and strokes of oil paint to achieve depth and contrast\" (Zega p. 61).  Zega p. 64."
