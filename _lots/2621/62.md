TYPESET: "Purvis' posters for the LNER run the gamut from traditional landscapes to people engaged in various activities. In the style of the Beggarstaff Brothers, \"he formed his figures solely from masses of color, without outline\" (Weill p. 228). His use of \"flat primary colors and the elimination of detail\" (Railway p. 135) was his graphic calling-card for which he was most emulated. This is one of two horizontal format golf posters Purvis designed for this Scottish golf destination. Rare. Furness Vol. 1, p. 189."
