It was a celebrity train on par with the Santa Fe Chief (which ran from Chicago to Los Angeles). The name \"Aristocrat\" was chosen to highlight the elegance of service, and the image emphasizes the classiness of the clientele. There is also some debate in professional circles as to the artist of this poster. It has been attributed both to Maurice Logan AND Fred Ludekens."
