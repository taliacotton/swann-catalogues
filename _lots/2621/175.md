The poster \"commemorates the commissioning of its massive high-level Hudson River Bridge at Castleton, New York. Herbert Morton Stoops, a New York artist best known for his wartime art and western scenes, chose to focus his work on the bulk of the span's soaring concrete piers, atop which a locomotive's steam trail is barely visible\" (Zega p. 68). Rare. We have found only four other examples at auction in the last 20 years. Zega 85."
