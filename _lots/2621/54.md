DESCRIPT: JEAN GABRIEL DOMERGUE (1889-1962)
CROSSHEAD: L'HIVER Á MONTE - CARLO. 1937.
TYPESET: <p>Domergue dedicated his working life to the elegant quotidian worlds of
  French society. Dividing his time between Paris, Deauville and the Riviera, he designed
  works for performers and fashion balls. This is one of a seasonal pair of images
  promoting the chic, Monaco destination that "sought to conjure up reverie, magic,
  luxury . . . with their slender, elegant ladies and graceful compositions (Azur
  p. 184). His<em> L'Été á Monte-Carlo</em> poster depicts two bathing beauties with
  the caption, "The most beautiful women in the world." Here, a lithe and fashionable
  couple promenade by the Monte-Carlo Bay on their way "to a gala evening on a night
  when the stars merge with the lights of the city and their reflections in the sea"
  (ibid). The text, which doesn't appear on all the variations of this poster, almost
  unnecessarily explains that the chic people winter down on the Cote d'Azur. In other
  words, Europe's rich and famous don't only spend their summers on the Riviera, they
  also spend their winters there. Azur 211, Riviera 101.</p>
