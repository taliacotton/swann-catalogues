  Situated between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth in South Africa, Mossel Bay is still
  a popular summer and winter retreat. Illustrated here is the "Santos Pavilion" at
  Santos Beach, "built in 1916 by Mr. W. Swart and designed by architect Mr. Harry
  Davidge-Pitts. Its design is based on architecture in Brighton, England. Originally
  used as a bathing pavilion and tearoom. It was also a popular venue for concerts
  and other social gatherings . . . The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1979
  and it was re-built from original plans for use as a restaurant and accommodation"
