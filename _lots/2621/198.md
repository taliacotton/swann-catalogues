TYPESET: '<p>One in a small series of national vistas that appeared on Wells Fargo
  delivery wagons (and eventually their trucks) to help solidify the company''s reputation
  for reliably transporting packages from coast to coast. From their founding in 1853,
  Wells Fargo stagecoaches were recognized and trusted couriers of mail, packages
  and money. In this capacity, they played an important role during the Washington
  gold rush between 1897 and 1900 and continued serving the Evergreen State after
  the excitement had died down. Treidler designed several posters for the company,
  including Washington a Capital City and California. )For more information, read:
