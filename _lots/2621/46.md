DESCRIPT: "LOUIS TAUZIN (1867-1914)"
CROSSHEAD: "LES VOSGES / CHEMINS DE FER DE L'EST. 1912."
TYPESET: "The Vosges mountains were never as popular as the Alps for winter sports; while they had plenty of snow, they weren't as high and didn't offer as challenging terrain for experienced skiers. However, the area was an ideal destination for families and vacationers who wanted the outdoor winter experience but didn't fancy themselves as professional athletes. Tauzin depicts just such a scene, where families and couples enjoy sledding, skating and skiing. As with his other travel posters, the treatment of light and shadows is very delicately and elegantly handled, with the suggestion of sunset just beginning to kiss the trees and fill the sky. This poster exists with several text variations, including one from the following year, 1913, promoting the 7th International Skiing Competition. Train p. 66 (var), Sports d'Hiver p. 42, Art of Skiing p. 58."
