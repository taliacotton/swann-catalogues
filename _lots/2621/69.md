TYPESET: "In 1936, the Southern Railway came up with a photographically-inspired poster of a young boy on a train platform talking to the driver of the train far above the platform in the cab of the locomotive. That endearing image was printed in different languages and quickly became ubiquitous, entering the national visual vocabulary of Great Britain. In this unofficial Art Deco spin-off, Thomson presents the locomotive in a manner much more in keeping with the designs of A.M. Cassandre. In a humorous twist, the driver needs to speak to the tiny child far below on the platform using a megaphone. Railway p. 145, Crouse p. 250."
