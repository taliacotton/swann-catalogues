TYPESET: "Mora was a prominent California artist of Uruguayan heritage who was well-known as a cartoonist, painter, cartographer, illustrator, photographer and sculptor. In 1998 the Monterey Museum of Art held an exhibition of his work, which they described as follows: \"Apart from its artistic merits, Mora's work is valued for its historical significance. As an astute observer, Mora created art that eloquently and accurately described the western land and way of life he admired, whether his subject was vaqueros, Hopi katsina figures, the Arizona landscape, turn-of-the-century Yosemite, or the California missions.\" This map of San Diego, published by The Marston Company in celebration of the city's Golden Anniversary is \"characterized by exquisite drawing, rich color, and great charm. Mora's maps revealed a deep knowledge of Western American history and culture. His maps formed the most important collection of pictorial cartography done by any artist of one particular region of the United States\" (Picturing America, p. 28-9)."
