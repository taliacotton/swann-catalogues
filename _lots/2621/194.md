CROSSHEAD: CITY OF SAN DIEGO / GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY. 1928.
TYPESET: '<p>&lt;QL&gt;Mora was a prominent California artist of Uruguayan heritage
  who was well-known as a cartoonist, painter, cartographer, illustrator, photographer
  and sculptor. In 1998 the Monterey Museum of Art held an exhibition of his work,
  which they described as follows: "Apart from its artistic merits, Mora''s work is
  valued for its historical significance. As an astute observer, Mora created art
  that eloquently and accurately described the western land and way of life he admired,
  whether his subject was vaqueros, Hopi katsina figures, the Arizona landscape, turn-of-the-century
  Yosemite, or the California missions." This map of San Diego, commissioned by Marston
  department store in celebration of it''s 50th anniversary is "characterized by exquisite
  drawing, rich color, and great charm. Mora''s maps revealed a deep knowledge of
  Western American history and culture. His maps formed the most important collection
  of pictorial cartography done by any artist of one particular region of the United
  States" (Picturing America, p. 28-9). Mora was hesitant to accept the commission
  from George Marston, who insisted on maintaining the right to republish (though
  he never did). Only 2000 copies were printed, and it is the only one with a unique
  envelope.</p>'
