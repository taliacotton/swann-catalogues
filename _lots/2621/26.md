CROSSHEAD: "BOEING 747 / THE GIANT JET IN THE SERVICE OF EL AL ISRAEL AIRLINES. Circa 1971."
TYPESET: "El Al began flying Boeing 747s in 1971 and they were used for the New York / Tel Aviv route. The new planes were nearly twice as big as any existing aircraft in the company's fleet. For the next 48 years the Israeli Airline operated 20 different aircraft from the 747 series. The last flight for the jumbo jet in service of the airline took place from Rome to Jerusalem in 2019. Here, an anonymous artist introduces the waning days of the psychedelic era to the new frontier of jumbo jet air service.  Rare. We were able to locate only one other copy, in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, inventory number A19960170000."
