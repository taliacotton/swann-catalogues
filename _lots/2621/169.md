TYPESET: "It is clear from looking at his images that Hill had an incomparable sense of graphic design and layout. His angles, perspectives and use of color lend themselves perfectly to poster design. \"Operating statistics are proving the wisdom of the L & N's stepped-up dieselization program. In May 1951, GM Diesel-powered freight trains on the mail line northbound, handled 87,347 gross ton-miles per train hour - 47% more than in May 1949 when no Diesels were in road service. In the next year L & N will have 357 Diesel units handling about 90% of passenger train miles; 68% of freight ton-miles; and 80% of yard switching locomotive hours\" (Railway Age, cover, December 31, 1951)."
