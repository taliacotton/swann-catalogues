DESCRIPT: FRANK NEWBOULD (1887-1951)
CROSSHEAD: BERLIN VIA HARWICH. 1925.
TYPESET: Frank Newbould did extensive work for the London & North Eastern Railway,
  as well as the Great Western Railway, The Orient Line and the Belgian Railways.
  In 1926, he was one of five artists contracted to work exclusively for the LNER;
  the others were Tom Purvis, Austin Cooper, Frank Mason and Fred Taylor. The contract
  lasted for three years. Adept at depicting both architecture and people, Newbould
  composed his colorful posters with a strong graphic eye. He designed several posters
  promoting travel to the continent, including images for Prague, Vienna, Budapest,
  Nuremberg and The Belgian Coast. Here, he captures a wonderful snippet of Berlin
  street life, in which elegant couples stroll down the boulevard, gentlemen enjoy
  the cafes, and automobiles and distinguished buildings line the avenue. Running
  through the center of Berlin, "Unter den Linden" was one of the grandest streets
  in Germany. Its name ("Under the Lindens") is derived from the distinctive trees
  that lined it. Rare. We have not found another copy at auction in 25 years. Voyage
