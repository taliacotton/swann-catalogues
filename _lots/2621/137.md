TYPESET: "In the 1930s, \"streamlined trains were among the most striking, visible and accessible examples of Modernism\" in America (Zega p. 104). \"The streamliner was perfectly suited to the poster medium; its smooth airflow profile offered the prospect of a respite from America's stylistic preoccupation with realism\" (ibid). The GS-2 locomotive (pictured here) was put into service in 1937; it was the first of its kind to bear the iconic red and orange color scheme. Trains, pulling 12 Pullman-Standard cars each, would leave Los Angeles and San Francisco at 8:15am every morning and arrive at their destinations simultaneously at 6pm. Pictured is engine #4410, the first GS-2 locomotive built for Southern Pacific."
