DESCRIPT: GEORGES EREMINE (YURI EREMIN, 1881-1948)
CROSSHEAD: MOSCOW / INTOURIST / MOSCOW HOTEL METROPOLE. Circa 1930s.
TYPESET: Taken from Eremine's 1928 photograph, "The Bolshoi Theatre, Grand Opera of
  Moscow." This view can practically be seen from the windows of the Hotel Metropole
  in downtown Moscow. In the mid-1930s, Stalin's preferred art form, Socialist Realism,
  began to take hold, and pictorialism fell sharply out of fashion within the Soviet
  Union, being labeled "bourgeois" and "ill-timed." Not in Intourist.
