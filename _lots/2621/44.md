DESCRIPT: "ADOLPHE MOURON CASSANDRE (1901-1968)"
CROSSHEAD: "VENEZIA. 1951."
TYPESET: "In a style consistent with the stage designs from later in his career, Cassandre depicts a tranquil vista on a Venetian canal. Considered to be \"his best tourist poster . . . the profile of the gondolier whose image is reflected in the water is harmoniously poetic. The image is vertically separated in two - on the right, a palace in the shade, and on the left, a luminous twilight. It is exquisite\" (Cassandre / Weill p. 220). In 1954, this image was reissued with additional text at the bottom to promote a Graphic Industries conference in Venice. Mouron pl. 68 (var), Cassandre / Weill p. 222, Suntory 65, Travel Italia p. 63."
