CROSSHEAD: "THE ZEPHYR / BURLINGTON'S STREAMLINE MOTOR TRAIN. 1934."
TYPESET: "The Pioneer Zephyr was the first diesel internal combustion powered streamliner. It was designed by Paul Cret and the architectural firm of Holabird & Root and built by Budd and went into service in 1934. Originally called the Burlington Zephyr, it was given the name Pioneer as other engines were put into service. Prior to its inaugural run, on November 11, 1934, the train went on exhibition around the country. The train made its first stop for one day in Philly, then it toured Eastern and Midwestern cities. It then went from Denver to Chicago to help inaugurate the second year opening of the World's Fair Century of Progress. Following that, it toured the Western states, which included the publicized stop here in San Francisco, then finally back to the Fair to be exhibited. The Chicago Tribune wrote, \"the Zephyr also was in the vanguard of a styling revolution\" May 1, 1994. Ultimately, more than half a dozen different rail companies were operating zephyrs."
