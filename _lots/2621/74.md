TYPESET: "Herkomer completed at least one other poster for the French Line, a majestic nighttime scene of the Normandie (See Swann sale 2524, Lot 71). That piece, completed 25 years after this design, features a more modern composition, with the monumental ship breaking through the frame of the poster and a dramatic limited palette. This poster features a less stylized ship but is creative in the backdrop of floating French landmarks, and the night skyline of Paris bordering the title below."
