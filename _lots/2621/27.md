DESCRIPT: HAFID AL-DROUBI  (1914-1991)
CROSSHEAD: WELCOME TO BAGHDAD. Circa 1960.
TYPESET: <p>Al-Droubi was a member of the "Pioneers" art group, Iraq's first formal
  arts society, and was a key proponent of the formation and development of Iraq's
  arts community. Best-known for his Cubist paintings, he designed at least four other
  posters published for the "Republic of Irak, Summer Resorts and Tourism Service"
  in Baghdad. Each features multiple languages and depicts sites for visitors to see
  in the city and around the country. This rare image, a fifth poster by the artist,
  is previously unrecorded and does not appear in the Qatar National Library database.
  This row of modernist buildings is in Tahrir Square, in the Bab Al-Sharqi neighborhood.
  This area of central Baghdad is located on the east bank of the Tigris River, right
  at the Al Jumariyah (Republic) Bridge. While the 1960s brought some significant
  cultural and economic growth in the establishment of theaters, hospitals, libraries,
  and a stadium, Iraq suffered from waves of political upheaval and war between moments
  of stability. In the decades that followed, sadly, this market was the site of many
  tragedies, including routine bombing attacks.</p>
