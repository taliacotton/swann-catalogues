DESCRIPT: WILLARD FREDERIC ELMES (1900-1956)
CROSSHEAD: ART INSTITUTE / BY THE ELEVATED LINES. 1924.
TYPESET: <p>Elmes, who is best known for his Mather Work Incentive posters, also designed
  about a half-dozen images for the Chicago Rapid Transit and the North Shore Line
  in the 1920s. The unusual, large format of some of these posters was unique to Chicago.
  Here, the Edward Kemeys' sculpted lion on the South side of the Museum's entrance,
  "in an attitude of defiance,” stands in front of the entry loggia with its arches
  and columns. The majesty of the Beaux Arts Institute, designed by Shepley, Rutan
  and Coolidge, emerges out of the blue twilight evening, ingeniously depicted by
  Elmes without using any outline. The original pedestal lamps, visible here shining
  yellow in the twilight, are no longer in place. </p><p>"Elmes proves himself to
  be a refined designer with a delicate feeling for continuity and balance in composition.
  He has a sensitive appreciation of colour and a fondness for harmonies in the lower
  keys, while his peculiar ability to see pattern in buildings and trees and figures,
  together with his expressive manner of drawing, help in no small way to give his
  designs that foremost place which they hold in current advertisement art" (Posters
  &amp; Publicity, 1926, p. 7). Rare. We could find only one other copy at auction.
