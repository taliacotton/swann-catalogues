CROSSHEAD: "SUNSET ROUTE / BY RAIL AND SEA TO NEW YORK. 1928."
TYPESET: "Kady was a San Francisco painter who did a lot of illustration work for magazines. A Southern Pacific brochure from 1931, with a variation of this image on the cover, describes the Sunset Route as connecting \"two of America’s most distinctive and truly cosmopolitan cities - San Francisco and New Orleans. Old Spain’s influence still lives along this route that runs close to Mexico. A one-day side trip over the Apache Trail highway of Arizona is a delightful break in the journey, as is the visit to the Carlsbad Caverns from El Paso. At New Orleans, after an interesting journey through the romantic South, the traveler may continue east or north by train or board a Southern Pacific steamship and reach New York after '100 Golden Hours at Sea.'\" In this effective pastiche image, Kady incorporates the train pulling out of its terminus in the West and the sea route to New York City."
