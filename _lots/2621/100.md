Returning to Australia as a freelance artist, Rogers' primary client was Qantas, for whom he designed a number of different poster series between the 1950s and the 1970s. In addition to designing posters for the firm, he was also involved in other aspects of their corporate identity, from brochures to typefaces. This series, one of several designed by Rogers for Qantas appeared as early as the mid-1950s, and the images were reissued in the following years (as seen here) featuring added structures, depicted in outline and with the jets flying from right to left (originally, they traveled from left to right).
