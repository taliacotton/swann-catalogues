TYPESET: "Making the run between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, the Streamline \"City of Las Vegas\" went into service for the Union Pacific in 1956 and ran until 1968. For the first nine months, the line was serviced by the sleek, General Motors Aerotrain, the \"all aluminum aeroflyte miracle,\" (pictured here). The train set included nine cars, one of which was the \"Chuck Wagon\" buffet car and another the \"Howdy Podner\" Bar / Lounge car. The \"free buffet meals,\" were said to be so popular that it helped offset any complaints riders might have had. Nine months after it began running, the railroad changed out the equipment, which was prone to mechanical issues, and replaced the Streamlined train with conventional streamlined cars."
