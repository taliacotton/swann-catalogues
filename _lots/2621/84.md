DESCRIPT: MONTAGUE BIRRELL BLACK (1884-1964)
CROSSHEAD: FRENCH LINE C.G.T / NORMANDIE. Circa 1938.
TYPESET: "<p>Montague Birrell Black was an accomplished ship portraitist and produced
  many of the paintings, postcards and posters for the White Star Line through the
  1920s. He also worked for other transportation companies, like the French Line and
  Blue Star Line, the London Underground and British Railway. This snapshot of the
  <em>Normandie </em>sailing out to sea, past a lighthouse, gives a wonderful impression
  of the monolithic size of the vessel. Seen from a low angle, the ship towers over
  everything and is in fact, too big to even fit inside the frame of the poster. Weallans
