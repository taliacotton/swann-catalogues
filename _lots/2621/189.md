TYPESET: "\"A colorful bird's-eye view of the Theme Center . . . [showing] fairgoers entering the Perisphere from the Trylon and leaving by the Helicline\" (World of Tomorrow p. 195). This poster was published two years prior to the fair, when the plans for the Trylon and Perisphere were first released to the press. It was not part of the later poster design competition to promote the fair, won by Joseph Binder. Nembhard N. Culin was an architect who worked with Frost, Frost & Fenner, a firm that designed several pavilions for the fair. This \"nighttime aerial view captures the fair's dramatic, otherworldly nature, and [Culin's] airbrushing creates an appropriate machine-like surface\" (Resnick p, 56). This is the rare large format. World of Tomorrow p. 194, Resnick 26, Taschen p. 323."
