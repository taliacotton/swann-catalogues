CROSSHEAD: THE NEW SUNSET LIMITED / FRENCH QUARTER LOUNGE. Circa 1950.
TYPESET: '<p>Introduced in 1950, the streamlined Sunset Limited ran between Los Angeles
  and New Orleans. It made the trip in 48 hours and was filled with delightful amenities
  and cutting-edge technology. A Southern Pacific promotional brochure for the train
  issued in 1950, explains that "The Sunset Route between New Orleans and Los Angeles
  takes you through these five states: Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.
  It is 2,070 miles long." It further touts the bar car thusly, "the full-length [French
  Quarter] lounge suggests the mood of New Orleans'' famous Vieux Carré, but in a
  modern setting. White wrought-iron grillwork accentuates the old French Quarter
  feeling. The watermelon-red ceiling lends a touch of Mardi Gras atmosphere." (<a
