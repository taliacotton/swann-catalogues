DESCRIPT: "KEES VAN DER LAAN (1903-1983)"
CROSSHEAD: "YPENBURG / VLIEGVELD / RIJSWIJK. 1936."
TYPESET: "Van der Laan spent three formative years in Paris, 1924-1927, a time when French Art Deco was flourishing. His Art Deco sensibilities were further reinforced when, back in Holland, he encountered Cassandre's work for Dutch clients. Van der Laan's posters reflect his versatility with the airbrush and an affinity for transportation in the Machine Age. This poster was issued upon the opening of the Ypenburg Airport in 1936. The airfield is delineated by the enormous shadow of an aircraft flying overhead. The poster also depicts the Functionalist style terminal, designed by Brinkman & Van der Vlugt who, among other projects, also designed the Van Nelle factory. The terminal had a restaurant, a roof terrace and a grandstand from which visitors could watch the activities of the NSL (the National Aviation School). Rare."
