DESCRIPT: ROGER BRODERS (1883-1953)
CROSSHEAD: SUR LA COTE D'AZUR. Circa 1931.
TYPESET: <p>More than just the joyful expression of an enthusiastic young woman greeting
  the day and embracing the climate on the Cote d'Azur, this poster has been cited
  as a classic example of shifting social mores, as well as a shift in the design
  of travel posters themselves. Here, the traditional "aristocratic or upper middle-class
  woman in a long crinoline dress who is carrying an umbrella in hand to protect herself
  from the sun [who was depicted in many turn-of-the-century travel posters], gives
  way to a young, buxom sun worshiper" (Azur p. 19). In 1933, this image was used
  by the PLM on the cover of a travel brochure (see <a href="www.travelbrochuregraphics.com"
  title="">www.travelbrochuregraphics.com</a>). Broders p. 90, Perry / Broders p.
  29, Le Train p. 102, Azur cover &amp; 11, Golden Age p. 109.</p>
