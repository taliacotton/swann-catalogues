TYPESET: "One in a series of ads produced by Mobil Oil. If this stylized, atmospheric landscape of pine trees and mountains looks familiar, that is because it is a near exact replication of the background of Hans Wagula's Österreich (Austria) poster from the 1930s (See Swann sale 2405, Lot 109). The ombre technique apparent in the tree line, the silhouette of the peaks, and the shapes of each form are uncanny when viewed side by side. Rare."
