CROSSHEAD: BEFORE YOU GO ON VACATION / MOBILUBRICATION. Circa 1940s.
TYPESET: <p>One in a series of ads produced by Mobil Oil. If this stylized, atmospheric
  landscape of pine trees and mountains looks familiar, that is because it is a near
  exact replication of the background of Hans Wagula's Österreich (Austria) poster
  from the 1930s (See <a href="https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/Lots/auction-lot/HANS-WAGULA-(1894-1964)-%C3%96STERREICH-37x24-inches-95x63-cm-Kif?saleno=2405&amp;lotNo=109&amp;refNo=710805"
  title="">Swann sale 2405, Lot 109</a>). The ombre technique apparent in the tree
  line, the silhouette of the peaks, and the shapes of each form are uncanny when
  viewed side by side. Rare.</p>
