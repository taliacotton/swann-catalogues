TYPESET: "\"As [his campaign with Southern Pacific] progressed, Logan's style also evolved . . . Concurrently, SP gave him free rein in both his poster style and selection of subjects . . . Logan's palette increasingly emphasized the brilliant colors emblematic of the California landscape . . . he made increasing use of the impasto technique, applying heavy, textured swirls and strokes of oil paint to achieve depth and contrast\" (Zega p. 61). From the image, this appears to be the Wawona Tree, in Yosemite National Park's Mariposa Grove, one of the giant Sequoias that had tunnels dug through them in the late 19th century. The Wawona Tree fell in 1969. Richmond p. 72."
