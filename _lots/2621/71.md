TYPESET: "Pat Keely established himself as a prominent graphic designer in the years before the Second World War, known for his strong, stylized Art Deco aesthetic (which he used most notably in his posters for the Southern Railway). During World War II, he was one of the artists chosen to participate in the workplace safety series commissioned by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. To promote the shipping facilities in Southampton, this masterful, modernist image of a ship and a derrick eschews outlining and uses bold geometric shapes."
