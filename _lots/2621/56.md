TYPESET: "In one of the classic railroad images to emerge from the Art Deco era, Fix-Masseau uses the triangle of the station roof, the circle and rectangle at the front of the train and the squares on the platform to create a powerful geometric image. Most often compared to Cassandre's Nord Express in its use of perspective, Fix-Masseau captures an entirely different element of train travel than is featured in Cassandre's romanticized image - punctuality. Using warm colors and a prominent display of the station clock as the train pulls in, the artist emphasizes his message - written across the top of the poster in a typeface that is as streamlined as the design of the train itself.
