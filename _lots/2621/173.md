TYPESET: <p>In the 1920s, the Chicago train companies, including the North Shore Line,
  the South Shore Line and the Chicago Rapid Transit Company "commissioned the city's
  finest graphic designers to produce advertising posters that encouraged Chicagoans
  to use rapid transit for more than commuting to work" (<a href="www.Chicago-L.org"
  title="">www.Chicago-L.org</a>). Hanson, who died extremely young, designed posters
  for all three of the companies; those he did for the Chicago Rapid Transit Company
  illustrated destinations one could reach by elevated train and subway. He is credited
  with designing 29 posters between 1923 and his death at an early age, in 1926. His
  compositions and graphic style set him among the best of American designers from
  the period.</p>
