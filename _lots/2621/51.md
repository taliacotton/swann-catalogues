DESCRIPT: ROGER BRODERS (1883-1953)
CROSSHEAD: SAINTE - MAXIME. 1929.
TYPESET: It is with this image that Broders formally turned toward geometric compositions,
  fully embracing flat planes of color and stylized landscapes. One of his most popular
  posters during his lifetime, it was widely used by several different organizations.
  Originally issued in 1928, the PLM railroad used this version in 1929, printed in
  a slightly smaller format. The S.N.C.F. used it as a poster in the mid-1930s, and
  the Saint-Maxime tourist office also employed it as a promotional image. Broders
