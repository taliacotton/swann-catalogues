DESCRIPT: TOM PURVIS (1888-1959)
CROSSHEAD: EAST COAST JOYS / TRAVEL BY L.N.E.R. Set of 6 posters. 1931.
TYPESET: Purvis' work for the British Railroads was exclusively for the LNER. Many
  of his posters for the railway promoted travel to the East Coast, depicting swimmers,
  sailors, beaches, beachgoers, children and hikers. This was the first of two series
  he designed, the other circa 1936, which presented six individual images that could
  be used on their own or as a set. When viewed side by side they form a continuous,
  panoramic strip of coastline. This effect is one Purvis borrowed from the Japanese
  Ukiyo-e woodblock print artists, specifically Utagawa Sadahide, "whose work was
  commonly constructed from multiple separate sheets" (Purvis p. 76). "Purvis is an
  artist of unusual versatility and technical range. He designs posters which are
  simplified patterns . . . bold impressions in which solid shadows only are left
  to 'tell the story' ; he works in 'woodcut' technique . . . In all his work there
  is personality, knowledge and vigor (Commercial Art, 1927, p. 151). This is a rare
  graphic masterwork; we could locate only one other full set ever having appeared
  at auction. Purvis pp. 76-7, Voyage p. 40-41, Gebrauchsgraphik, June 1931, pp. 44-45,
  Modern Publicity, May 1931, p. 212.
