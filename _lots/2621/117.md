TYPESET: "Oregon's scenic Crater Lake could be accessed by automobiles arranged by the railroad from the Southern Pacific's stations of Weed and Medford. The incredible region, which consists of \"21 square miles of water so intensely blue it looks like ink, ringed by cliffs towering up to 2,000 feet above. The mountain bluebird, Indian legend says, was gray before dipping into the waters. The tranquil Gem of the Cascades is set in a dormant volcano called Mount Mazama, one in the chain of volcanoes that includes Mount St. Helens. Mount Mazama's eruption about 5700 B.C. catapulted volcanic ash miles into the sky and expelled so much pumice and ash that the summit soon collapsed, creating a huge, smoldering caldera. Eventually, rain and snowmelt accumulated in the caldera, forming a lake more than 1,900 feet deep, the deepest lake in the United States\" (http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/national-parks/crater-lake-national-park/)."
