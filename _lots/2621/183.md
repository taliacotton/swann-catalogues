DESCRIPT: HANSON PUTHUFF (1875-1972)
CROSSHEAD: THE CHIEF TO CALIFORNIA / CAJON PASS. Circa 1936.
TYPESET: <p>Puthuff, born in Missouri, studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and
  the University of Denver Art School before settling in California. He made a career
  as a commercial artist - creating murals, billboards, theater advertisements and
  even museum dioramas for the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History. In 1926, he
  turned entirely toward fine art, exhibiting his signature landscape paintings in
  museums around the country and becoming involved in several art clubs and associations
  (<a href="http://collections.lacma.org/node/166744" title="">http://collections.lacma.org/node/166744</a>).
  </p><p>Puthuff counted himself among the California Plein-Air Painters, mockingly
  coined "The Eucalyptus School," creating most of his mountain landscapes on location.
  Even though he had just decided to abandon commercial art, the Santa Fe Railroad
  commissioned him that same year to paint views of the Grand Canyon for advertising.
  The painting featured in this Santa Fe Railroad poster illustrates an Impressionistic
  and atmospheric view of a different landmark, the Cajon Pass - the mountains so
  monumental that the viewer may not even notice the Chief train chugging along in
  the middle ground. Rare. We have found only three other instances of this poster
  at auction.</p>
