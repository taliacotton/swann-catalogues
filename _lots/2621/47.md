DESCRIPT: ROGER BRODERS (1883-1953)
CROSSHEAD: LA ROUTE DES ALPES. Circa 1920.
TYPESET: In this, one of his earliest travel posters, Broders masterfully employs
  his signature use of depth of field, with the vegetation and people in the foreground
  and the route from Nice to Geneva in the background. His depiction of the people
  touring the Alps by motor coach is straightforward and illustrative, bearing none
  of the Art Deco stylization that became his hallmark in his works from later in
  the decade. Broders p. 66, Perry / Broders p. 57, Hillion p. 252.
at-a-glance: 42x30½ inches, 106¾x77½ cm.
FOOTNOTE: 'Condition A-: minor creases and abrasions at edges.'
