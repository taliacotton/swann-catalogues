CROSSHEAD: FISHGUARD - CORK / THE "INNISFALLEN" WAY. Circa 1935.
TYPESET: <p>Rodmell enrolled in the Hull School of Art in 1912, and that same year,
  designed his first magazine cover. More than just a maritime artist, he was also
  a very active commercial designer. In addition to his paintings, his artistic legacy
  is filled with magazine covers, posters, calendars and tide tables. "His work for
  the ocean liner industry was prodigious and his images graced the posters of more
  than sixty-five companies" (Rodmell p. 20). These included Canadian Pacific, French
  Line, Swedish Lloyd, Shaw-Saville and Albion Line, General Steam Navigation Co.,
  Royal Holland Lloyd, and Norddeutscher Lloyd Bremen. The <em>Innisfallen </em>was
  built in Belfast by the Coast Lines Group in 1930 and ran frequent routes between
  Cork and Fishguard in Wales, as well as offering weekend tours. It was sunk by a
  German mine in 1940.</p>
