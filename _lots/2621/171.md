TYPESET: '"The beauty of Hill''s locomotive paintings is found in the way he captures
  the essence of each railroad. The 1950s represented a period in railroad history
  that found America with an abundance of regional rail lines, all featuring distinctive
  paint schemes. Often railroads operated only in a small geographical location and
  were unknown in some parts of the country" (Railroad Heritage No. 6, 2002, p. 10).
  The name "Black Diamond" was derived from anthracite coal, which was the predominant
  cargo carried by the Lehigh Valley Railroad.'
