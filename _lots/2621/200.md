DESCRIPT: PAUL GEORGE LAWLER (DATES UNKNOWN)
CROSSHEAD: FLY TO SOUTH SEA ISLES / VIA PAN AMERICAN. Circa 1938.
TYPESET: One of the most iconic and desirable of all the early Pan Am flying boat
  posters, this image of the Boeing 314 Flying Clipper landing in a tropical lagoon,
  captured and continues to capture the imagination of travelers. The location shown
  on the poster is an imaginary composite of several renowned bays throughout the
  South Pacific. It has been speculated that the view may be Tahiti, Pago Pago or
  Diamond Head, however, the physical characteristics depicted do not coincide with
  the actual geography of any of these islands. Lawler most likely worked from photographs
  to derive a fantasy collage of a location, infused with realistic details from various
  islands. It is rare to find this poster with text. We have found only three other
  examples at auction. Pan Am p. 112, Airlines cover, Airways cover and p. 83, Krupnick
  p. 283.
at-a-glance: 41x27¼ inches, 104x69¼ cm.
FOOTNOTE: 'Condition B+: minor repaired tears, creases and overpainting in margins;
  restoration along creases and abrasions in text and image.'
