TYPESET: "The legend of the \"Flying Dutchman,\" a ghost ship destined to sail the seas forever without ever making port, and whose sighting is considered a portent of doom, seems a very unlikely model upon which an airline would base their advertising. And yet, KLM used the ancient myth as part of their promotion material for decades. The Dutch airline first flew Lockheed Constellations in 1946, ultimately employing over 25 of the aircraft to service their routes."
