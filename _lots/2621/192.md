DESCRIPT: D'APRÈS DAVID KLEIN (1918-2005)
CROSSHEAD: TWA / FLY TWA SUPERJETS. Three-dimensional cardboard kiosk. Circa 1960.
TYPESET: An exceptional point-of-purchase display in the form of a three-dimensional
  Parisian poster kiosk. It boasts a selection of real TWA posters (in miniature)
  designed by David Klein and a few imaginary French posters included to improve the
  overall visual effect. Connoisseurs will appreciate the versions of Klein's famous
  New York poster as well as Germany, Florida, Boston, Egypt, Paris, the Orient, San
  Francisco, Rome and London. Pictured on the top part of the kiosk is a TWA 707-131.
  The tail fin call numbers indicate that this plane went into service for the airline
  early in 1959 - one of the first jets in their fleet. This cardboard display also
  came in a smaller version (4¾x12½x4¾ inches), with a variant crown. Rare.
at-a-glance: 36x13x13 inches, 91½x33x33 cm.
FOOTNOTE: 'Condition B+: creases and minor abrasions at edges and along seams; slight
  warping; backed on cardboard, pieced together with some stapling, as issued. Comes
