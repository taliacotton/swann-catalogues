TYPESET: A rare, early broadside for the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad.
  This unusual view of the Northern Hemisphere shows a complete route around the world
  via train and steam ship. One cannot help but think that this poster was inspired
  by Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 Days, which was published in 1872, as it
  states on the poster that the duration of an "entire circuit of the globe is about
  seventy-eight days."

FOOTNOTE: 'Condition C: extensive repaired tears, losses, creases and restoration
