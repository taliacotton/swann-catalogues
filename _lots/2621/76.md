CROSSHEAD: "NACH WEST - INDIEN AB NEW YORK / NORDDEUTSCHER LLOYD BREMEN. Circa 1925."
TYPESET: "A bold, stylized image of an American Indian Chief clad in a war bonnet, wrapped in a ceremonial blanket and holding a peace pipe. The mannerist Art Deco style is as captivating as the geo-anthropological theme is wrong. Rather than advertising a cruise to the New World, the poster is in fact promoting cruises from New York to the West Indies. Likely, the German artist took liberties with the word \"Indies.\" Vacationers who signed up for this cruise with the hope of seeing an Indian chief in the Caribbean would have been very disappointed."
