CROSSHEAD: WHITE STAR LINE / TYPES OF WORLD FAMOUS LINERS. Circa 1927.
TYPESET: "<p>A montage of ships servicing the White Star Line, presented within and
  around a white star itself. On display are vessels with one, two, three and four
  funnels, an indication of the breadth of their fleet. As far as identifying each
  ship - in the center is the <em>Majestic</em>, the four-stacker at the bottom is
  the <em>Olympic</em>, moving clockwise from the bottom is the one-stack <em>Megantic</em>,
  then one of the Big Four (<em>Celtic</em>, <em>Cedric</em>, <em>Baltic</em>, <em>Adriatic</em>).
  The<em> Arabic III</em> is on the top right, and finally, on the lower right, is
  the <em>Albertic</em>. There has been a lot of confusion as to the date of this
  poster, but as the <em>Albertic </em>only joined the White Star Fleet in 1927, the
  poster must have been produced after that year.</p>"
