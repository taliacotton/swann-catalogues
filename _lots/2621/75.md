TYPESET: "A montage of ships servicing the White Star Line, presented within and around a white star itself. On display are vessels with one, two, three and four funnels, an indication of the breadth of their fleet. As far as identifying each ship - in the center is the Majestic, the four-stacker at the bottom is the Olympic, moving clockwise from the bottom is the one-stack Megantic, then one of the Big Four (Celtic, Cedric, Baltic, Adriatic). The Arabic III is on the top right, and finally, on the lower right, is the  Albertic. There has been a lot of confusion as to the date of this poster, but as the Albertic only joined the White Star Fleet in 1927, the poster must have been produced after that year."
