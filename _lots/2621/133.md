DESCRIPT: SAM HYDE HARRIS (1889-1977)
CROSSHEAD: SOUTHERN PACIFIC'S NEW DAYLIGHT. Gouache maquette. 1937.
TYPESET: <p>Harris was born in England and moved to Los Angeles when he was 15. He
  began his career as a commercial artist, painting notices on sides of buildings,
  creating signs and billboards, designing posters, typography and more. In 1920,
  he was hired by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company to design posters.
  He also worked for the Southern Pacific. "The major portion of the advertising appeared
  in brochures, magazines and newspapers, but local advertisements were in the form
  of billboards and hand-painted posters that appeared in department stores, banks,
  displays in windows and bulletin boards in ticket offices and lobbies" (Harris p.
  18). </p><p>In the 1930s, "streamlined trains were among the most striking, visible
  and accessible examples of Modernism" in America (Zega p. 104). "The streamliner
  was perfectly suited to the poster medium; its smooth airflow profile offered the
  prospect of a respite from America's stylistic preoccupation with realism" (ibid).
  An excellent example of American modernist design. Zega 141, Harris p. 103, Affiche
  Art Deco p. 86, Affiches Chemins de Fer p. 69.</p>
