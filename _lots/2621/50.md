DESCRIPT: ROGER BRODERS (1883-1953)
CROSSHEAD: ANTIBES. Circa 1928.
TYPESET: This image, evoking the stylish, languid reminiscences of an F. Scott Fitzgerald
  story, is an uncanny example of art imitating life, imitating art. Fitzgerald and
  his wife, Zelda, stayed in this Riviera town in 1926, and it was during his time
  there that he began writing his novel Tender is the Night. The stylistic rendering
  of the main figures is too sophisticated to have been early in Broders' career.
  A visual chronology of Broders' works shows that he began to master the use of diffident
  characters with elongated bodies in 1928. Broders p. 91, Riviera 60, La Mer p. 116,
  Azur 144, Perry / Broders p. 27, Furness vol. 8 p. 97, Cote d'Azur p. 38.
at-a-glance: 41½x29¾ inches, 105½x75½ cm. Lucien Serre & Cie., Paris.
