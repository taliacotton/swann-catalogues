CROSSHEAD: ÉTOILE DU NORD. 1927.
TYPESET: "<p>L'Étoile du Nord was an absolute revolution in advertising when it first
  appeared in 1927. Although advertising a Pullman train, it was startlingly new to
  have a travel poster that depicted no landscape, no destination, and no train. The
  pure and powerful image is a tribute to the dramatic use of perspective, with the
  train represented metaphorically by the star dancing on the horizon where many rails
  converge in the distance. To keep the image as clean and unobstructed as possible,
  Cassandre corrals the typography at the very bottom of the composition and then
  organizes it in a neat and structured frame around the border. Here, he also develops
  one of his signature design elements: viewing an object from a low angle to make
  it seem larger than life and more impressive, a technique he perfected in his 1935
  poster for the Normandie. Through his association with Maurice Moyrand, who was
  the agent for the printer L. Danel, (and with whom he would form the Alliance Graphique
  in 1930), Cassandre was commissioned to create two posters for the Chemins de fer
  du Nord in 1927. </p><p>Mouron pl. 11, Cassandre / Weill 51, The Poster 185, Suntory
