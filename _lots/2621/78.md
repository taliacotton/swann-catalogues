TYPESET: "Walter Thomas designed posters for several shipping companies including Cunard, White Star, Lamport & Holt and the British Navy. Here, he forgoes showing any vessel and focuses instead on a man wearing a Nemes (the striped head cloth worn by pharaohs, with the traditional lappets - (the flaps that hung down in front of the shoulders) and Wesekh (the broad neck piece). Since the discovery of King Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922, the Western world was captivated by the wonders of ancient Egypt, and Thomas plays to that infatuation with this image."
