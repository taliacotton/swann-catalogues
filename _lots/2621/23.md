TYPESET: "Klein was a commercial illustrator who designed a number of posters for popular Broadway shows in the 1940s and 1950s. He is best remembered for his series of posters for Trans World Airlines in the 1950s and 60s, many of which have entered the visual vernacular of American culture. Among the most sought after of his travel poster work is this geometrically inspired image of zebras grazing in tall African grass. Almost abstract in the interplay between the zebras' stripes and the stalks of grass, this image has a colorful, hypnotic quality, which is a hallmark of Klein's work. Huhne p. 72, The Poster 549."
