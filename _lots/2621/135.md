CROSSHEAD: TWO DAYLIGHTS DAILY! TO LOS ANGELES / SOUTHERN PACIFIC. Circa 1938.
TYPESET: Southern Pacific began operating its streamlined train service, Daylight,
  between San Francisco and Los Angeles in 1937. The route was so popular (the trains
  were frequently referred to as "the most beautiful trains in the world") that by
  1940 they were running twice a day. The Morning Daylight and the Noon Daylight.
  It wasn't until the middle of 1938 that Southern Pacific began offering their $6

  had to lower the price in the face of competition from the Santa Fe Railroad, which
  offered cheaper tickets on the same route.
