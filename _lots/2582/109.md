Bonhomme printed three volumes of Terenece in 1560, that seem not to be considered a set. They contain different content, are almost never found together, and all use the identical title. This one is considered the third part, but fully independent. as Brunet writes, \"Les trois volumes se trouvenet rarement r√©unis.\"<br><br>Adams T-354; Fabricius I 57; Schweiger III 1061."
