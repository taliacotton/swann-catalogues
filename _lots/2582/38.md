CROSSHEAD: "A Collection of Greek Tragedies."
TYPESET: "<br>Geneva: Henri Estienne, 1557; [and] Geneva: Paulus Stephanus, 1602 & 1603.<br>Three titles bound in five large octavo volumes with title pages and prefatory material for all three bound in the first volume and thirty-three plays broken out separately and bound in an order determined by a former owner, all content pulled from the following titles: <i>Euripidis Tragoediae quae extant. Cum Latina Gulielmi Canteri Interpretatione</i>, Geneva: Excudebat Paulus Stephanus, 1602; <i>Sophoclis Tragoediae Septem. Una cum omnibus Graecis Scholiis, & Latina Viti Winsemij ad Verbum Interpretatione</i>, Geneva: Paulus Stephauns, 1603; [and] <i>Aeschyli Tragoediae VII</i>, Ex Officina Henricus Stephanus, 1557; volumes II-V contain individual plays of Aeschylus in Greek, and of Euripides and Sophocles in Greek and Latin; the material from the three titles bound up as a set with blank leaves for notes inserted between plays; when the plays do not break evenly with the pages, any missing lines have been provided in manuscript on the adjacent blank; bound in uniform 17th century sprinkled calf, spines and boards tooled in gilt, headcaps chipped, joints cracked, ex libris Camden with armorial engraved bookplates, marginal notes, 9 x 6 in.<br>This interesting custom remixed compilation of texts is practically impossible to collate, as it pulls from three separate publications. Therefore, any statement of completeness is inherently fraught. However, thirty-three plays are present in the collection and since the Sophocles and Aeschylus publications mention seven plays in their titles, and Euripides's surviving output comes in at nineteen extant tragedies, it seems that all plays are represented, as follows. Volume I: title pages and prefatory material. Volume II: Prometheus Bound, Dana√Ødes, Ion, The Bacchae, Medea, Hippolytus, Alcestis, Hercules Furens, The Trachiniae, and Children of Heracles. Volume III: Oedipus Tyrannus, Oedipus at Colonus, The Seven against Thebes, Phoenissae, Antigone, and The Suppliants. Volume IV: Agamemnon, Choephori, Electra (Sophocles), Electra (Euripides), Orestes, Eumenides, Iphigenia in Aulis, and Iphigenia in Tauris. Volume V: The Trojan Women, Hecuba, Andromache, Helena, Rhesus, Ajax, Philoctetes, Cyclops, and The Persians.<br>Aeschylus: Renouard 116 no 5, Schreiber 145; Euripides: Renouard 196 no. 11; Sophocles: Renouard 196 no. 12, Schreiber 273."
