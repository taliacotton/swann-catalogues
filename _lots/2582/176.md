He is valued for his style and clarity. In the main, he advocates for following nature rather than interfering, with advice to let a fever take its course, for example. He explains how to prepare narcotics, writes against vivisection, and weighs the pros and cons of animal and human experimentation. Celsus is also credited with identifying the cardinal signs of inflammation: calor, dolor, tumor, and rubor."
