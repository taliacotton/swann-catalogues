A description of the equipment she used for carrying out the fermentation process appeared in the London journal <i>Philosophical Magazine</i> in 1823, a notably early date for a report of technical developments by a woman experimenter. Her method of using semi-closed vessels rather than the open vats then in general use gave a higher quality product for wines, cider, and beer; two years previously a short monograph on wine production and the advantages of the semi-closed-vessel method, which had already been granted a government patent, had been published by [her brother] Jean Antoine Gervais.\" (cf.
