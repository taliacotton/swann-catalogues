[...] [In] the <i>Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest</i>, Matthew Restall argues that Spanish conquests in the Americas can mostly be explained by a combination of three factors working together-- epidemic disease, native disunity or micropatriotism, and metal weapons (but not necessarily guns and horses.)\" (cf.
