(2)<br><br><i>The Bookroom of Europe</i> was a publication edited by Rabus and contained notice of newly published books. \"The pages of this periodical were teeming with the ideas of the greatest minds of those days – John Locke, Robert Boyle, Christiaan Huygens, Fénelon, Balthasar Bekker, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, Richard Simon – and their innovative way of thinking. The intention was not only to promote these ideas among an intellectual elite, but also to disseminate them among a much wider circle of interested people that had hitherto been denied access to the cultural and spiritual life in Europe. The periodical in question was designed as a non-specialist medium but was nevertheless of sufficient scientific caliber to be properly considered as a variant of the then already existing scientific press.\" (cf. <i>Intellectual emancipation during the Early Enlightenment: The Ambitions of aPioneering Periodical from Rotterdam</i>,  Léon Stapper, Universiteitsbibliotheek Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen. http://www.eerp.nl)"
