Ruysch's discovery settled a dispute between Johannes van Horne and Louis de Bils regarding the existence of valves within the lymphatic vessels. The renowned Dutch anatomist lectured and dissected for more than sixty-five years as professor at the Amsterdam Guild of Surgeons. His innovations in the preparation and preservation of tissues allowed him to dissect the delicate lymphatic system and its structures."
