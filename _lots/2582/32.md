TYPESET: "<br>Provins: Citoyen Michelin, père, Imprimeur-Libraire de la Ville & du District, 29 Oct. 1793.<br>Broadside, typographically printed on laid paper, formerly folded in quarters; 21 x 16½ inches.<br>This political broadside was printed during the Reign of Terror in the French Revolution. Dubouchet represented the district of Provins, Seine-et-Marne, a suburb of Paris. \"Dubouchet implemented Revolutionary measures such as dechristianization and the tax on the rich, and he conducted purges to put sans-culottes in charge. Although hundreds were placed under suspicion during his three-month-long mission and dozens jailed, some for long periods, those suspected of serious crimes were sent to Paris to be judged. Nobody was killed in the Seine-et-Marne, though some citizens of the department were executed by Paris's Revolutionary Tribunal.\" (cf. Jeff Horn's <i>The Making of a Terrorist: Alexandre Rousselin and the French Revolution</i>, Oxford University Press, 2020, page 63 ff.)<br>This broadside orders the destruction of all dungeons, fortified castles, and any other monuments of ancient feudalism. Whether these structures are old or new, with or without turrets, bastions, or battlements, they must be destroyed if they are surrounded by a moat with a drawbridge or any other evidence of feudalism.<br>A rare imprint, not in OCLC nor in Bibliothèque National."
