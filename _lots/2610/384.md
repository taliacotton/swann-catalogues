FOOTNOTE: "Finely executed aquatints picturing the Great Fire of 1835. Over 20 square blocks were destroyed by the fire which lasted for several days and resulted in over $20 million in property damages.\n\nThe first print, viewed from the perspective of Wall and William Streets, shows the Merchant's Exchange engulfed in flames. The second, from Exchange Place looking east, shows the ruins of the Garden Street Church. \n\nBennett's mastery of the aquatint process is particularly evident here, unobscured by hand-coloring. "
