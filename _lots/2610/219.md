FOOTNOTE: "Rare bound collection of all six spectacular large-scale topographic vistas
  by nineteenth-century America's most successful viewmaker. \n\n- Birds Eye View
  of Virginia, Maryland Delaware and the District of Columbia. \n- Birds Eye View
  of North and South Carolina and Part of Georgia. \n- Birds Eye View of Florida and
  part of Georgia and Alabama. \n- Birds Eye View of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama
  and Part of Florida. \n- Birds Eye View of Kentucky and Tennessee Showing Cairo
  and Part of the Southern States.\n- Birds Eye View of Texas and Part of Mexico.
  \n\n\"The panoramic map in fact became a popular and effective technique for conveying
  information about the Civil War. Early in 1861, the skillful artist and lithographer
  John Bachmann of New York City conceived the idea of producing a series of bird's-eye
  views of the likely theaters of war. These visually attractive panoramas were easily
  understood and perhaps more meaningful to a public largely unskilled in map reading\"
