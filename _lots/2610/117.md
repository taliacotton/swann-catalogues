FOOTNOTE: "An interesting repurposing of the lower Welsh section of the Ordnance Survey of England, Wales and Part of Scotland. Cardiff publisher William Lewis has taken the extremely detailed Survey map as his base and lithographed to it the names of nearly 100 steam collieries operating in the South Wales Coalfield in the late nineteenth century. Each tract is neatly hand-colored and presents a striking geological profile of the activity happening at one of the world's largest coal regions nearing the peak of its industry. No other copies located. "
