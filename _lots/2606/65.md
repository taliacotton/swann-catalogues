  65 - 141 in this catalog are a selection of works from the Gary Snyder collection.
  Gary currently lives in Whitehall, Montana. He has established his most recent gallery
  project, Gary Snyder Fine Art, MT, in Manhattan, MT, twenty miles west of Bozeman.</p><p>Gary
  Snyder became director of Princeton Gallery of Fine Art and relocated to 588 Broadway,
  NY, changing the name to Snyder Gallery. Arline and Barry Snyder opened their “Princeton
  Gallery of Fine Art in Princeton, NJ, in 1970. Situated close to Bucks County and
  the rich artistic heritage of the region, the shape of the gallery inventory soon
  took on a lean toward modernism. In 1985 the gallery held a memorial exhibition
  for Werner Drewes. Drewes was a founding member of the American Abstract Artists
  group, and the only member who studied at the Bauhaus school in Germany. Works of
  Werner Drewes graced the walls of Princeton Gallery as did works by Joseph Stella,
  Ethel Magafan, Wolf Kahn, Clarence Carter, and Bucks County Modernist Louis Stone,
  (Lots 65 – 79).</p>'
