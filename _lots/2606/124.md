  12 - February 20, 1955.</p><p>Julien Levy opened his New York gallery with an exhibition
  of photographs with little enthusiasm from his audience.  Though his passion for
  photography never diminished, he realized his strength lay in his connection to
  European Surrealist artists. Showing the works of Max Ernst, Salvador Dali, Man
  Ray, and Rene Magritte he soon found his niche. Surrealism's impact on young artists
  in America through Julien Levy's gallery is immeasurable. Artists such as Leon Kelly
  and Phillip Perkins show direct influence, while Abstract Expressionists like Conrad
  Marca-Relli, Herman Cherry, and Harold Shapinsky owe much to the development of
  their expressive style to automatic painting concepts of the Surrealist pioneers.</p>"
