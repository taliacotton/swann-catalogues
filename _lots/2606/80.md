FOOTNOTE: "\n\nSnyder Fine Art, under Gary Snyder's directorship, opened the fall
  season in 1995 with \"1937: American Abstract Art.\" This show was largely assembled
  around the works of the founding members of the American Abstract Artists, (AAA).
  <QL>In 1936, artists in New York frustrated by the exclusion from museum and gallery
  representation of American artists working in a modernist style, began meeting in
  the studio of sculptor Ibram Lassaw. Their conversations would culminate in the
  formation of the AAA and self-representation through annual exhibitions. The first
  of these exhibitions was held in the Squibb Building at 745 Fifth Avenue, April
  third through the seventeenth, 1937. <QL>In 1995 a large portion of art collectors
  and dealers knowledgeable about modernist art were unaware of these American abstract
  artists whose careers blossomed in the years between the World Wars. New York art
  dealer, Martin Diamond had re-discovered many of these artists and revived their
  careers in the early 1980s. Gary was amongst the first dealers to give a scholarly
  presentation of their works and do so on Fifty-Seventh Street in New York City,
  the premier gallery address at that time. <QL>To better understand the revisionist
  efforts of Gary Snyder, we can look at his catalog introduction from <I>1937: American
  Abstract Art.\n…\"rather than continuing to categorize this era as underappreciated
  and relatively unknown, we can recognize the accomplishments of the American abstract
  artists of the 1930s, and the insights of those who have embraced the period and
  contributed to its understanding.\" \nLots 80 -96 in this catalog are works by members
  of the American Abstract Artists group as well as a drawing by Emil Bisttram who
  formed the Transcendental Painting Group with fellow abstract painter Raymond Jonson
  in New Mexico, 1938."
