FOOTNOTE: "When Gary Snyder moved to Chelsea with Gary Snyder ProjectSpace, his current
  scope of vision was fine tuned to post-war hard-edge abstraction and color field
  painters. Amongst the latter, Thomas Downing stands out for his unique approach
  to \"stain painting,\" (painting with water based permanent pigments on raw canvas).
  Downing developed a language through mostly dots where scale and color broke up
  an otherwise uniform surface with no other illusionary devices to create depth of
  field. \n\"Thomas Downing: Washington Color School Painter,\" opened October Fourth,
  2007 at Gary Snyder ProjectSpace. Downing's seven foot plus canvases in this raw
  white space were once again given freedom to do their push-pull magic."
