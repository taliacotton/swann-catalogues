FOOTNOTE: "Gary Snyder is a champion of artists who for any number of reasons never
  received the attention their work and chosen artistic paths deserved. Steve Wheeler,
  and the Indian Space Painter movement that followed him, has a story that belongs
  in the annals of American modernist history. Snyder Fine Art held four important
  exhibitions focused on Steve Wheeler and his peers: \"Mythic Space,\" 1991; \"Hello
  Steve: Works from the 1940s by Steve Wheeler,\" 1992; \"Steve Wheeler, A New Modernist
  Language,\"1994; \"Steve Wheeler: Selected Works and the Artist's Library,\" also
  on view, \"A Memorial Exhibition of Works on Paper by Robert Barrell,\" and \"Works
  on Paper from the 1940s by Gertrude Barrer,\" 1996. \nLots 110 - 120 in this catalog
  are works on paper by Steve Wheeler's friend, Peter Busa, and Art Students League
  peers Gertrude Barrer and Helen DeMott. The Art Students League was the haven for
  artists to exchange ideas and develop art theory for this and many other generations
  of artists. Will Barnet, also a practitioner of Indian Space painting, taught a
  course at the League emphasizing the visual language found in indigenous cultures
  of the Americas."
