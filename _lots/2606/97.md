  March of 1996, Snyder Fine Art opened its exhibition, "Museum of Non-Objective Painting:
  American Abstract Art." Gary Snyder acquired a large body of works from the Hilla
  Rebay Estate, many of the works on paper spent decades archivally stored in flat
  files with fresh colors and immaculate paper.</p><p>The Museum of Non-Objective
  painting was Solomon R. Guggenheim''s precursor to his Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum
  of Art we know today. Under the guidance of Hilla Rebay, Guggenheim was a pioneer
  in assembling a collection dedicated to art whose objective was purely spiritual
  and void of abstract forms derived from nature. Rebay would become the first director
  of Guggenheim''s Art of Tomorrow: The Museum of Non-Objective Painting, when it
  opened its doors at Twenty-Four East Fifty-Fourth Street in 1939. Hilla Rebay not
  only promoted the current practitioners of this new form of art, rather she convinced
  her patron to allow her a stipend to fund young artists who chose pure abstraction
  as a means for their voice. Lots 97 - 109 in this catalog are works by American
  artists who participated in Hilla Rebay''s art experiment.</p>'
