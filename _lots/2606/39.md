CROSSHEAD: "Barre."
TYPESET: "Bronze rod weldement on a steel file, c.1960. 210 mm; 8¼ inches high on a 45x83 mm; 1¾x3¼ inch base. <br><br>Provenance: Saidenberg Gallery, NY; Private collection. <br><br>David Hare showed at Saidenberg Gallery from 1960 - 1964, with five one person exhibitions in that time period. The title, Barree, may possibly refer to the French artist, Martin Barre. Hare is known for his creative license with spelling. During the time period when this work was created, the artist divided his time between New York and paris, interacting with intellectuals and artists in both cities. Barre and hare shared similar concepts about art, and it is within reason David hare would honor his fellow artist with an enigmatic sculpture of his own."
