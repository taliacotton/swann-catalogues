TYPESET: "In the 1890s, Cassan Fils was one of the largest printers in Toulouse and one of the best in France. They were an extremely dynamic company that had opened up an office in Paris and commissioned posters by Baylac and Mucha. This allegory of the river, La Garonne, which flows from the Pyrenées to Bordeaux, was designed as a poster to advertise the firm and appears with several different text variations. The drawing and design owe a lot to Alphonse Mucha, but the colors are purely Foäche's. Cassan Fils also used this print as a present for clients and had it printed without text, as seen here. Abdy p. 149 (var), DFP-II 359 (var)."
