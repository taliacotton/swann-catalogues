TYPESET: "Evenepoel was a rising star in the art world when his life was tragically cut short at the age of 27. He designed his best print for <I>L'Estampe Moderne</i>, a five-color lithograph whose subject matter is close to the work of Bonnard, and whose sketch and coloring is reminiscent of Lautrec.
