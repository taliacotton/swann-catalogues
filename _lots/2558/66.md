TYPESET: "This biblical-themed play by Sarah Bernhardt's favorite author, Edmond Rostand, has been long forgotten by the theatrical world. All that survives of its memory is Mucha's excellent poster. The story is of a young Palestinian girl from Samaria who becomes a follower of Jesus and converts her entire tribe to Christianity. Within the mosaic design behind Bernhardt's head, Mucha has included the name \"Jahwe\" (Jehova), and the rest of the typography has been given Hebrew stylization.
