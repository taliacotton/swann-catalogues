TYPESET: "A cinematic triptych, in which a harried officer tries to hold back crowds of people eagerly lining a road waiting for something to approach (\"What are they waiting for?\"). The steepness of the incline is indicated by the roadside sign which states \"chevaux renfort,\" reinforcement horses, a notice that more horses would have to be hitched to a wagon to get it up the hill.\" In the second image, the bystanders all turn their backs on the viewer to follow the course of the vehicle up the road, (\"it can only be . . .\"). And in the final poster, once again the harried office tries to hold back the curious throng from getting too close to the vehicle that was able to ascend that hill so easily. Salon de Automobile, 9."
