TYPESET: "A bright, abstract, kaleidoscopic view of Times Square, with its billboards, lights, traffic, energy and excitement depicted in Day-Glo, electric colors that further convey the visual splendor of the city. Originally issued in 1956, the poster featured a detailed image of a TWA Constellation. The image was so popular that the airline reused it when it fully entered the Jet Age, changing the image to feature the silhouette of a jet plane. A year after it was first issued, a copy of this poster was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art for their permanent collection. This is the larger version, with the silhouetted jet plane. Metzl p. 166 (var), Airways p. 148 (var), MoMA 329.1957."
