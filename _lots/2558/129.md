TYPESET: "The Dubo-Dubon-Dubonnet \"mascot\" is certainly one of Cassandre's most memorable creations. Such was its appeal that his character has graced everything from ashtrays to menus to fans, helping to make Dubonnet one of the most popular French aperitifs. He was also used to advertise the product outside of France, as seen in this Danish printing which faithfully reuses the 1932 image. This is the larger format. Cassandre cover and pl. 37 (both var), Reina Sofia p. 184 (var)."
