TYPESET: "\"Skiing made it possible to visit the mountains that had hitherto been inaccessible and dangerous. Posters often showed skiers stopping and admiring the magnificent scenery . . .  [images with] the foreground in shadow and the light of the snowy mountains in the distance . . . convey a feeling of serenity and poetry that undoubtedly persuaded many to take up skiing . . . in the same style, Wilhelm Friedrich Burger produced an exceptional work . . . which shows a sleigh being pulled by dogs through beautiful scenery. This work  . . . is among the best Swiss posters that helped to give Swiss tourism its reputation throughout the world\" (Swiss Winter Sports p. 24). This is the larger format.
