TYPESET: "<I>L'Estampe et l'Affiche</i> was a magazine devoted to prints and posters; during the two years of it's publishing run, it was a mainstay of the print and poster collecting community. Bonnard's image, using only three colors, is a charming allegory of the life and spirit imbued in collecting prints. It shows a young collector coming home in such a hurried and excited state that some prints are actually falling out of her huge portfolio. An older woman, who represents a different generation of collectors who do not understand all the rage surrounding paper, bemusedly observes her process. The freely-drawn typography literally invades the image, with prominence of placement and the bold white color of the paper given to the word \"Affiche.\" DFP-II 80, Gold 89."
