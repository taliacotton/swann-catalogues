After World War II broke out, F.E. Cheeseman veered away from football-themed maps, in favor of more overtly-patriotic subjects. \"Pictorial maps also showed American sports and pastimes. The regionalist movement of the 1930s, well represented by WPA guides to individual states, inspired an interest in folklore . . . American sports were also mapped, notably by F.E. Cheeseman in his series of college football maps\" (Picturing America p, 79.)"
