TYPESET: "In 1896, <I>The Seasons</i> were Mucha's first foray into the world of decorative panels, and they became \"one of [his] most endearing and enduring sets. The idea of personifying the four seasons was nothing new . . . but Mucha breathed so much more life into it that this became one of the best selling sets of decorative panels\" (Rennert / Weill p. 90). \"Mucha's style of [this] time was characterized by brooding, melancholic figures, strong theatrical poses, and flowing robes that at the same time hide and reveal beautiful female bodies whose figures are outlined by bold decorative line\" (Spirit of Art Nouveau p. 184). They were printed in many different variations and sizes. Mucha went on to design two further series of <I>The Seasons</i> in 1897 and 1900 (see lots 63-65). Rennert / Weill 18, Lendl 54, Mucha / Bridges P6, Spirit of Art Nouveau 44."
