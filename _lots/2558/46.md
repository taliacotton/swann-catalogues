TYPESET: "<I>Le Frou Frou</i>, subtitled as a \"Chronicle of elegant life, theatrical news, echoes of the world,\" was a humor magazine launched in 1900, in print until 1923. From its inception, its aim was to titillate, thus it included many renderings of dancing women with frilly skirts in playful and risqué poses. This original artwork by Gottlob (one of the biggest contributers of illustrations to the magazine) is no different, depicting a young woman perched on a turn-of-the-century camera, seemingly lost in thought - and having lost track of her sleeve."
FOOTNOTE: "Condition B+: loss in upper left corner; small repaired tears, creases and abrasions at edges; minor foxing and staining in background; pencil, ink and gouache on paper; hinged to mat at top edge. Matted."
