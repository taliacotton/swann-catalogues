at-a-glance: "50½x35½ inches, 128¼x90¼ cm. Wolfsberg, Zurich."
TYPESET: "One of two posters Cardinaux designed for the famous resort hotel; this one shows lounging winter guests around a skating rink, while the other, a summer scene, depicts golfers. In both, employing casual grace and compelling composition, Cardinaux depicts tableaux in his simple, bold style. This poster captures a specific attitude, incorporating mood, style and fashion, to reflect the lifestyle of the hotel's clientele. It is interesting to note the vainglorious manner in which none of the main subjects are paying attention to the winter sport happening around them.
