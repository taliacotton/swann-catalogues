TYPESET: "As a painter, van Rysselberghe was best known as a Neo-Impressionist. In 1883 he was a founding member of the influential art group Les XX (Les Vingt, \"The Twenty\") and he is considered one of the more important Belgian painters of the period. When Les XX dissolved in 1893, it transformed into another group called La Libre Esthétique, with which van Rysselberghe was also very active. \"Van Rysselberghe exerted a positive force for the revitalization of the decorative arts at the turn of the century, but his posters are not numerous; those he created for <I>La Libre Esthétique</i> are unquestionably the finest. The elegant female figures of his posters, very knowingly placed on the page, seem to be the pretext for van Rysselberghe to balance large spots of red-orange against their greenish or bluish complementaries. The text is beautifully drawn and gracefully integrated into the design of the poster\" (Belle Epoque p. 86). He designed two posters for the group.
