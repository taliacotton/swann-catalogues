TYPESET: "The French Automobile Club was founded in 1895 and organized their first exhibition in 1898. After the 1900 World's Fair had ended and the prestigious Grand Palais became available for major events, the <I>Auto Show</i> relocated there and grew in both prominence and size. It was held in the Grand Palais for the next 50 years. In 1902, Livemont was commissioned to design the poster advertising the fifth <I>Auto Show</i>. The large format image he designed clearly impressed the organizers and the public, as he was commissioned to design two more posters for the organization: the generic poster for the Automobile Club de France, and then one for the <I>Sixth Automobile Show in 1903</i>, this charming image featuring one of his archetypical women driving past the magnificent Grand Palais. Livemont 40."
