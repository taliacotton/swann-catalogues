TYPESET: "An exceptional image of ballerinas backstage at the Folies Bergère, waiting to perform. Biais combines the <I>Japonisme</i> of Toulouse-Lautrec (notice the pronounced diagonal of the floor), with his personal mastery of flat tones and broad, sensuous outlining and adds an intriguing compositional trick. With one of the ballerinas looking out through a hole in the wings of the theatre, she is likely looking to see if one of her admirers is already in his seat. \"Anyone viewing the poster could imagine that he was the one being watched\" (Folies Bergere p. 8). <i>Rare</i>. Folies Bergere 30."
