at-a-glance: "38¾x24¼ inches, 98½x61½ cm. Lucien Serre & Cie., Paris."
TYPESET: "A stylish and serene scene of a fashionable skier stopping mid-mountain and surveying the hotels and winter amenities of the Vosges region. Some confusion exists as to this artist's name; as elegant as his Art Deco posters are, his signature is virtually illegible. Daniel Hillion refers to him as \"Chauffard\" and \"Choucard\" in the same book! Previously thought to date from circa 1925, this poster bears a tax stamp from 1932, suggesting a later printing date than traditionally assumed. This is the French version. Hillion p. 131."
FOOTNOTE: "Condition B+: repaired tears at edges, some slightly into image; creases, abrasions, overpainting and restoration along sharp vertical and horizontal folds; ink and paper stamps in lower right."
year: 1932
