TYPESET: "This is one of Mangold's earliest posters (his first was printed in 1902). In his formative years, Mangold's work reflected the influence of Hans Sandreuter. A Swiss painter (who also designed several posters), Sandreuter's work was inspired by Greek mythology and his images are filled with allegorical figures in classical poses. To announce this upcoming Song Festival, Mangold combines Secessionist design elements and mythology. Arion, the Greek poet who was saved by a dolphin, is depicted in Lake Constance swimming toward Zurich. Soon after this poster was designed, Mangold began working with the inimitable Swiss printing house of Wolfensberger. He quickly abandoned his symbolic approach and naturalist renderings, began using flat colors, and became one of the pioneers of the modern Swiss poster art. Mangold 42, Swiss Art Nouveau 80."
