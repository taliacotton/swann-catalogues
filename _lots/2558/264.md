In 1998 the Monterey Museum of Art held an exhibition of his work, which they described as follows: \"Apart from its artistic merits, Mora's work is valued for its historical significance. As an astute observer, Mora created art that eloquently and accurately described the western land and way of life he admired, whether his subject was vaqueros, Hopi katsina figures, the Arizona landscape, turn-of-the-century Yosemite, or the California missions.\"  Copyrighted in 1936, this version was printed later in color."
