TYPESET: "\"Before Erik Ludvig Henningsen graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, he was apprenticed as a decorative painter. In his paintings and book illustrations, he depicts in a naturalistic way especially the life of the people in Denmark and it is this predilection for everyday situations that is repeated in Henningsen's most famous poster of the sweaty and thirsty Tuborg man. The poster was made in connection with a competition for a \"decorative advertising poster,\" which Tuborg printed in 1900. Although it was another painter who ran away with the 1st prize, it was Erik Henningsen's poster that was put into production\" (www.danskplakatmuseum.dk/plakaten/danske-plakatkunstnere/erik-henningsen/). Litfass p. 77, Drink 67."
