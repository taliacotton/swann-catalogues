TYPESET: "Germaine Marx, studied art in France in the 1920s, and designed a number of archetypal Art Deco movie posters -largely stylized portraits of performers, none is as captivating as this bustling, energetic composition for \"La Femme de Mes Rêves.\" The film, \"The Woman of my Dreams,\" is about a penniless musician who seduces a wealthy American widow, lives with her in her hotel until he is able to successfully marry her. The montage-like layout and imagery are reminiscent of graphic treatment for movie posters coming out of Russia during the same period. Such was the quality of her artistry, that in 1932 her posters were featured alongside those of A.M. Cassandre, Paul Colin, Jean Carlu and Charles Loupot in a special edition of an art and literature publication called <I>Les Cahiers Jaune</i>,\" published by Jose Corti, dedicated to Masters of the French Poster. During the 1930s she married Francois Verna and due to the onset of World War II, they settled in Switzerland, where she spent the remainder of her career painting landscapes and portraits."
