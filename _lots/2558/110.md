TYPESET: "A <i>rare</i> and monumental poster showcasing the expansive fairgrounds in Roubaix, illuminated by a Farman biplane overhead. As a city whose textile manufacturing prowess had greatly prospered from the industrial revolution, Roubaix was eager to hold a World's Fair in 1911 to help further establish its status and reputation in the eyes of the world. Held in the city's Barbieux Park from April until November, the exposition contained: palaces of decorative art, industry, textiles and machines; pavilions from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, New Zealand, Chile and the Netherlands; a Colonial section, a Sengalese village, a casino, stadium and restaurants. Aviation, still in its infancy, also played a big role in the exposition. A small airfield was constructed near the fairgrounds and the first flying demonstration there took place on June 4th; on June 12th, assembled aviators flew over the city and the exposition grounds. Roubaix was also on the five-stage European flying circuit, encompassing a 15-day race through five cities - on June 26th the Roubaix-Brussels stage was held. Ironically, a few years after this successful event, the First World War broke out, after which Roubaix lost its foothold as the economic superpower of Northern France. This poster also exists in a smaller, one-sheet format."
