TYPESET: "Roger de Valerio was involved in many different aspects of the printing and publishing world. He worked as Art Director for two different magazines: <I>Le Matin</i>, from 1911 to 1914, and <I>Le Rire</i>, in 1932. In 1917, he went to work for Salabert, the music publishers, and during his seven-year tenure with the company, he designed over 2000 different sheet music covers. He also worked as an adviser for the printer Devambez in 1926, and from 1936, served as Associate Director of Advertising for the publisher Perceval. Throughout this busy career, he also found time to produce many posters, all of which were executed with an impressive Art Deco flair. This poster is one of the great pre-war Art Deco Air France images, in which a personification of the airlines rises out of a plane, the round Air France logo in her hands echoed by the circles of the propellers and the moon in the sky. Air France p. 12."
