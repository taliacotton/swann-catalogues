TYPESET: "Félicia Mallet was a French comedian, singer and pantomime artist, known for starring in the first staging of Victorien Sardou's drama <I>La Tosca</i>, alongside Sarah Bernhardt. In another role, she served as understudy for Yvette Guilbert. Playwright George Bernard Shaw said of Mallet: \"She is a good observer, a smart executant, and a vigorous and sympathetic actress, apparently quite indifferent to romantic charm, and intent only on the dramatic interest, realistic illusion, and comic force of her work.\" In this Chéret depiction, Mallet performs in a pantomime act, confidently walking a tightrope.
