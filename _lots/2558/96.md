at-a-glance: "37x50Â¾ inches, 94x129 cm. Firmin-Didot, Paris."
TYPESET: "A rare and beautiful poster as well as an important document pertaining to the firm that invented the motorcycle. The Werner Brothers first introduced the motorcycle to the world at the <I>Salon du Cycle</i> in 1897, and went on to patent the word \"motocyclette.\" However, the machines became so ubiquitous that a court ordered them to give the name back to the public out of \"common necessity.\" Roubille, a key member of the <I>Salon des Humoristes</i>, was an illustrator for many of Paris' turn-of-the-century magazines for whom he contributed rather radical illustrations. His signature style, with bright, flat colors and broad outlining is unique and instantly recognizable. He applied his graphic skill to only a few posters, which all reflect the same standard. This <i>rare</i> poster is a superb example of his ability to render complex images from simple colors."
FOOTNOTE: "Condition B+ / A-: repaired tears at edges; creases in margins and image."
