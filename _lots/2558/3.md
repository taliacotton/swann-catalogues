TYPESET: "Leonard Smithers, a libertine, book dealer and publisher of erotica, founded the magazine <I>Savoy</i> in 1896. For his principle illustrator, he employed Beardsley, who had recently lost his position at the <I>Yellow Book</i> due to intense criticism of his mores. In Victorian England, such a publication did not last long - only 8 issues were published. Beardsley designed all the covers and numerous illustrations for the articles, as well as some stories himself. This image, referred to by Beardsley as a 'posterette,' was his design for the cover of the last issue, and after the magazine's demise, it became the cover for the complete three-volume set of <I>Savoy</i>."
