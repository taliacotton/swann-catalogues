TYPESET: "Volodimer would not be remembered at all as a poster artist except for the images he designed in 1923, 1924 and 1925 for the first three 24-hour endurance car races that became known as the legendary \"Le Mans.\" It was originally conceived as a three-year event, in which the winner, determined by whoever amassed the most miles over the three separate races, would be awarded the Rudge-Whitworth Cup. For this first-ever running of the prestigious race, the artist provides an exciting night time scene to emphasize the 24-hour element of the race. The poster also provides information about the other activities included to ensure that this became a popular and trendy event, such as fireworks, a jazz band and food organized by a Parisian brasserie. A <i>rare</i> document from the history of car racing."
FOOTNOTE: "Condition B+: overpainting along repaired tears at edges and abrasions in image; abrasions from creasing in image. Silkscreen."
