TYPESET: "In 1924, the Eighth Olympic games were held in Chamonix. One year later, \"these successful Games were retrospectively recognized at the [International Olympic Committee] Congress in Prague as the first Olympic Winter Games\" (Olympics p. 35). The decision to hold these winter games came in 1921, and \"triggered a period of frenzied construction as rail and road links and hotel development opened up the area to international tourism\" (Ibid p. 33). This is one of five official posters for these winter games, all of which were published by the PLM Railway, rather than by the Olympic Committee. They were all issued with text variants, sometimes promoting the Olympic Games and sometimes just promoting winter activities in the area itself. A variation of this image exists with the additional text \"Sports D'Hiver à l'Occasion de la VIIIe Olympiade / 25 Janvier-5 Fevrier 1924.\" Voyage, p. 110, Sports d'Hiver p. 102, Art of Skiing p. 55, Hillion p. 194 (var)."
