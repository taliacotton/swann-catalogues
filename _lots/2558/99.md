TYPESET: "An image combining politics, sports, history and technology. Pictured is Maurice Garin, the winner of the first Tour de France in 1903, next to a map indicating the tour's route. His \"Francaise\" bike stands next to the list of races it has won with Garin astride, while his extended arm, politically, covers up the recently lost territory of Alsace-Lorraine. Garin's bike is filled with the latest innovations: a Brampton roller chain, the Brown anatomical leather saddle, Dunlop's recently invented tubular tires and the just introduced \"Bowen\" wire cable brake."
