TYPESET: "Leslie Carter was an extravagant woman and aspiring actress whose incredible success was largely attributed to her charms and the shrewd way in which she applied them to her pursuits. Both Mucha and the author of the play promoted by this poster, <I>Kassa</i>, (a commercial disappointment, despite the wonderful poster) were both so taken with her that they completed their work without compensation. For this poster, one of the few that Mucha designed while living in America from 1904-1912, the artist is clearly harkening back to his poster designs for Sarah Bernhardt from earlier in his career, as the tall format of the poster, the drape of the gown, the halo behind the actress' head and the crown of flowers are all reminiscent of his work in the late 1890s. Mucha had clearly lost nothing of his ability to design a great theater poster (although one cannot help questioning the choice of blue-green for the actress' skin tone). Curiously, the title of the production itself, appears nowhere on the image. The poster, printed by Strobridge, is signed \"from a design by Mucha;\" most likely had the artist been on the press, he would have corrected this detail.
