TYPESET: "The appearance of Halley's Comet in 1910 caused quite an uproar around the world. The wine distributors Dondena & Sons, in Milan, took advantage of Italy's general unease with the cosmic appearance and had Aldo Mazza to create an image of a comet in whose tail were the words \"mineral water.\" According to that poster, the populace could \"save themselves\" by drinking wine. That same year, Dondena applied for a trademark for their company featuring a star enclosed in the letter \"D.\" This poster is a glorious allegory of Italian wines, in the figure of a woman emerging from grape-ladened vines, wrapped in Italy's tri-color flag and holding aloft the company's logo. Mazza began his artistic career as a caricaturist and book illustrator. By 1900, he had begun to design posters and worked with a variety of different clients to advertise sporting events, the Mele department store, and numerous publications and exhibitions. <i>Rare</i>."
