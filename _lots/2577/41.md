TYPESET: Huntington was a prominent and award-winning sculptor who worked predominantly
  in New York City. She became most famous for her realistic bronze animals, for which
  she conducted preparatory sketches at zoos. Her <i>Joan of Arc</i> sculpture, located
  on Riverside Drive at 93rd Street, was the city's first monument dedicated to a
  historical woman, in 1915 - also the city's first public monument by a woman. This
  <i>rare</i> poster for the Betsy Ross Corps puts Huntington's sculptural prowess
  on display in two-dimensional form, as the designer of the Corps' trophy. The paramilitary
  organization of female pilots was founded in 1931 by Opal Kunz, to support the Army
  Air Corps, but was never formally recognized by the U.S. Military.
