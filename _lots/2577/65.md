TYPESET: "Willy Stöwer, the son of a sea captain, trained as a shipyard worker but soon became a skilled marine painter and illustrator. A favorite naval artist of Kaiser Wilhelm II (he even accompanied the Kaiser on voyages), it is not surprising that Stöwer was hired by the imperial German fleet to promote their submarine weapons and to call upon the public for donations. Otherwise-known for his prolific illustrating - \"creating approximately 900 black-and-white and 335 color illustrations for 57 books, as well as posters, postcards, trading-cards, labels, brochures and calendars,\" Stöwer gained fame for his depiction of the sinking <i>Titanic</i> in 1912. Here \"he manages to convey something of the isolation and bleakness of a submarine patrol in foul weahter\" (Paret p. 34.) Paret 44."
