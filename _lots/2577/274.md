Welsh . . . Welsh had studied at the Academie Julian in Paris and had made a name for himself painting the mural decorations in the Chicago Room of that city's famed Palmer House . . . [for this series] he bathed his subjects in brilliant color and rendered their surroundings in Art Deco-styled patterns\" (Zega p. 109).
