TYPESET: '"The great charm in Mr. Parrish''s work lies in its curious individuality.
  It may well be said that he has felt the influence of many predecessors in design,
  but his work is stamped with his own originality. He is adroit enough effectively
  to conceal his borrowings if indeed he has borrowed at all. He realises for us a
  fairyland, undiscovered until he became its pioneer . . . every fact in the picture
  in itself appears to be tangible: it is the atmosphere with which Mr. Parrish invests
  all his facts which produces the sense of aloofness and elusiveness which one feels
  as one looks at his drawings. . . . [here] the figures of the three golfers are
  almost photographic in their realism. The undulating landscape, with its trees and
  cottage in the middle distance, is quite delightful" (The Poster and Art Collector,
  by Charles Hiatt, volume IV). Keay p. 22, Virginia p. 32, Art of Parrish 443.'
