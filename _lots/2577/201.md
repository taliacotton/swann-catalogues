TYPESET: Norwegian-born Gulbransson spent some time in Paris before settling in Munich
  where he actively worked for the magazine <i>Simplicissimus</i> and occasionally
  designed posters. Another <i>Simplicissimus</i> artist, Thomas Theodor Heine, had
  already created a poster for the Zust automobile (using <i>Simplicissimus'</i> emblematic
  bulldog, which he, himself, had designed) and it was most likely through him that
  Gulbransson got this commission. Using his pure, minimalist style with flat colors,
  he creates a dynamic composition with the massive dark form of the car arriving
  at the top of a hill in a cloud of smoke and dust. The overall effect is a marvelous
  combination of masses of color and the interplay of light and shadow. DFP-III 1122,
  Munchen no. 166.
FOOTNOTE: 'Condition B / B+: extensive expert overpainting in margins and image and
  around text; expertly repaired tears at edges, some into image; restoration along
