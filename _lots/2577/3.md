TYPESET: "\"Convinced that war with Germany was inevitable, Frances Adams Halsted wrote her poem, <i>Columbia Calls</i>, in 1916. After America entered the war on April 6, 1917, Halsted donated both her poem and accompanying image design to the U.S. War Department. Three months later, the <i>New York Times</i> announced plans to print 500,000 copies as a poster, intending to use the proceeds to establish a home for orphaned children of American soldiers and sailors. Painter Vincent Aderente, who executed Halsted's design, had emigrated from Italy at age six, studied at the Art Students League in New York City, and served as an assistant to muralist Edwin Howland Blashfield\" (Library of Congress, 001.01.00).
