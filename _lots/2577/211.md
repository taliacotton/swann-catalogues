TYPESET: Fenneker's recognizable style - most famously seen in over 300 movie poster

  decadence. Here, he presents a dramatic view of Berlin's Luna-Park amusement park,

  for the park, each with a glamorous couple against a dark background to emphasize
  the glow of the pink, yellow and teal details.
