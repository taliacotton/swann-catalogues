CROSSHEAD: MONTAUK BEACH. Circa 1929.
at-a-glance: 25½x19¾ inches, 65x50 cm. Winchell Publicity Service, New York.
TYPESET: 'The development of Montauk in the mid-1920s was solely attributed to one
  rather extraordinary entrepreneur named Carl Fisher. Fisher almost single-handedly
  transformed Miami Beach into an international destination for America''s wealthiest.
  In 1925, he turned his attention to Montauk, and purchased the entire area- almost
  10,000 acres. His vision was singular: he would create "A Miami of the North," so
  the wealthy could live by his slogan, "Miami in the Winter, Montauk in the Summer."
  His vast plan included a 200-room luxury hotel (The Manor), golf courses, a boardwalk,
  facilities for tennis, polo, archery, and golf, fox hunting and much more. He also
  created a deep harbor for large yachts by blasting an opening from the freshwater
  Lake Montauk to the sea. We can date this poster between 1929 and 1932 based on
  the following: on October 24, 1935, the <i>East Hampton Star Newspaper</i> reported
  that "The first deluxe Pullman Lounge Cars were put in service on the Long Island
  Railroad in 1929." Fisher was hit by intense financial difficulties after a hurricane
  struck his properties in Miami and then in the crash of 1929. By 1932, he was bankrupt
  and his empire had collapsed. This <i>rare</i> poster, a "Jazz Age" array of characters
  seemingly straight out of <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, is one of only a few known examples.'
