TYPESET: A fashionable couple flirts at the confluence of the bay and a pool, beneath
  a decorative trellis, with the beaches and town in the distance. A highly stylized,
  delightful Art Deco image, from the woman's hair to the suggestion of waves in the
  water. Bouchaud is known to have designed one other poster, for Val d'Esquieres,
  another waterside resort, but a poster that is far less Art Deco than this scene.
  He was also a painter and illustrator and designed many album covers. Voyage p.
  50, Riviera 214, Affiche Art Deco p. 103, Azur 369, Tourism 94.
