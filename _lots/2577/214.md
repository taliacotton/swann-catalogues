TYPESET: "A lavish and vivid scene, in which the bewitching female subject fills the frame with her extravagant fur-trimmed gown (in Loupot's favorite orange shade). The reading and smoking woman encompasses so much of the composition, that the pillows and hint of wall behind her provides just a subtle backdrop. Even the table beside her seems to be floating over the flowing dress fabric, rather than on the floor and the poster's text fits comfortably in this solid space. Loupot 53, La Femme 173."
