TYPESET: "Two Dukes, one grasping a document entitled \"Land Revenues\" plaintively  beseech an airman in a Bleriot XI soaring overhead to vacate \"their air.\" This clever political poster for the Liberal Party was quite early to capitalize on the new-found technology of heavier-than-air flight. It was only in 1909 that Louis Bleriot flew one of these aircraft successfully over the English Channel for the first time. The figure flying overhead is David Lloyd George, a prominent figure in the Liberal Party and Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1908-1915. He went on to become Prime Minister in 1916. In 1909, he had proposed a \"People's Budget\" - taxes on landowners and those with higher incomes (the nobility and aristocracy) in order to fund new social welfare initiatives. It was ultimately passed in 1910 and is considered to be the foundation of the modern welfare state."
