TYPESET: "\"The Olympia opened in Paris in April of 1893 as the first establishment to call itself a 'music-hall' - a term borrowed from British vaudeville which soon made its way into French vocabulary. From the start, the Olympia exploited feminine allure for all it was worth; whatever its various revues were called, they always featured beautiful girls in revealing costumes . . . [Pal] was a perfect choice to create one of the Olympia's first show posters. His well-proportioned, realistically-drawn beauties projected a sensuality no other posterist could match\" (Gold p. 112). The ladies are shown dancing on the British shore, with the Brighton Palace Pier in the background. The children, playing in the rain with their umbrellas, are perhaps a commentary on the British weather, but they also mimic the parasols held by the dancers. Maitres 35, Reims 929, Maindron 99, Gold 162, Femme 63."
