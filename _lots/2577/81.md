TYPESET: "Coiner learned his craft during a six-year stint at an advertising agency in Chicago. In 1924, he moved to Philadelphia, where he joined the art department at N.W. Ayer. Coiner gained national recognition with the logo he designed for the NIRA, The National Industrial Recovery Act. He became a key figure in the modern approach to advertising during the late-1930s while working with the Container Corporation of America campaigns, for which he was allowed to hire all of the avant-garde talents that he wanted. Coiner's \"Blue Eagle\" became a ubiquitous sight in New Deal America, as it was displayed coast-to-coast by businesses. It has since become an icon of American Modernism. Enacted in 1933, the National Industrial Recovery Act was a New Deal public works program intended to provide an economic stimulus."
