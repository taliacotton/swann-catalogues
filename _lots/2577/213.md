TYPESET: "The Bal Tabarin, a popular night club in Montmartre, was opened in 1904 by Auguste Bosc, a composer of some renown in Paris during the \"gay nineties.\" The club made its reputation with the Belle Époque favorite, the cancan, continuing to perform it long after the First World War, when the craze had all but died elsewhere. In the mid-20s two retired dancers infused the club with new life by introducing the Charleston. The passage of time and the changing trends are all illustrated in a spectacular manner here, with three different women dancing three separate dances all melded into one image. One element is clear among all the different characters in this poster - each is exposing enough skin to tantalize the viewer to attend an event there. This is one of the most sophisticated compositions Colin designed, infused with incredible movements of the various arms and legs, and containing different layers, combining three images into one. Using only three colors, Colin pays a flamboyant tribute to the art of dancing and has created a classic image reflecting the energy of Paris during the Jazz Age. This is the smaller format.
