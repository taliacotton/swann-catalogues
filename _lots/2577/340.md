TYPESET: "An eye-catching work in which hockey players are skillfully rendered in saturated colors. The different colored outlines and strokes of color also add to the poster's effectiveness. The Federazione Italiana Hockey e Pattinaggio is the Italian governing body for all sports involving skating and hockey, and they likely printed this image in conjunction with the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome. This poster was originally printed with a blank panel at the bottom, intended to be filled with the time and date of an upcoming match. This poster is occasionally misattributed to Corrado Mancioli, who designed a poster for the same organization in the late-1930s."
