TYPESET: "Schnackenberg studied with Franz von Stuck at the academy in Munich, and through his travels was exposed to the work of Toulouse-Lautrec in Paris. The two artists shared a passion for depicting nightlife, cabarets and performers, yet Schnackenberg's theatrical vision was more attuned to the prevailing German mood than fin-de-siècle Paris. His posters are an incarnation of the extravagance, decadence and morbidity at the center of Weimar-era indulgences. Similarly to Toulouse-Lautrec in Paris, Schnackenberg left behind a visual gallery of the demimonde of Munich's nightlife; filled with weird performers and dancers. Schnackenberg also worked extensively on theatrical and costume design. This poster is a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec's work, with elements of <i>Divan Japonais</i> - the elegant couple looking down at a performer on stage, a nod to <i>Jane Avril</i>, with the high-leg kicking can-can dancer, and to <i>Moulin Rouge</i>, in the people seen in silhouette. Unlike Toulouse-Lautrec, here the typography flows through the image like the performer. Encyclopedie de l'Affiche p. 231."
