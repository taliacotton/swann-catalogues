TYPESET: "Skansen is an open-air museum and zoo in Stockholm, founded in 1891 by Artur Hazelius to celebrate everyday life in the provinces of Sweden before the age of industrialism. Fearing that the idyllic days of rural life would be forgotten, Hazelius shipped 150 traditional houses in pieces to the museum grounds to be rebuilt there. \"Within the capital, Skansen was quickly established as an excursion over the day, the obvious choice for a free Sunday. In a way, the founder Artur Hazelius changed the whole idea of the attraction by marketing it to the tourist. The concept is now so established that the word Skansen means open-air museum in several languages, including Polish\" (Sweden p. 115). Nyman designed a number of posters, although his largest client was Skansen. Here, he depicts the Solliden Restaurant. Sweden 116."
