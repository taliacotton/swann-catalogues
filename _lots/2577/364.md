TYPESET: 'Artist Rights Today (A.R.T., Inc.) was a collaborative effort of artists
  to reclaim legal rights to their work, specifically poster artists who produced
  advertisements for organizations like the Avalon Ballroom and Family Dog in the
  1960s. These are three of four posters made for A.R.T., Inc. benefit events in the
  late 80s. The design of each poster was in itself a collaborative effort by five
  of the most famous and successful artists of the psychedelic era: Wes Wilson, Stanley
  Mouse, Alton Kelley, Rick Griffin and Victor Moscoso. Each poster in the series
  was printed both as a lithograph and as a limited-edition of 350 silkscreen prints.
  This is an example of the latter, more <i>rare</i> prints, hand-signed by each of
  the artists.'
FOOTNOTE: Condition A. Each hand-signed by all five artists in pencil, and numbered
  43/350. Matted and framed together.
