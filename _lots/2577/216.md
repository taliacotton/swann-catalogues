He is backed by a painterly, diagonal swath of what could pass for a billowing fire, but is more likely the vibrant autumn foliage – with a few leaves scattered on the ground behind him. Loupot's use of color – especially his signature orange and complementary blue & green tones, results in an eye-catching, energetic composition.
