CROSSHEAD: THE LAST OF THE KNICKERBOCKERS. Circa 1901.
at-a-glance: 20x29 inches, 50¾x73½ cm. Carqueville Litho Co., Chicago.
TYPESET: A <i>rare</i> and wonderful work by Penfield that is exceptional for both
  its size and its content. "Although Penfield continued at <i>Harper's</i> as Art
  Editor until 1901, his poster series stops in 1899" (Designed to Persuade, p. 15).
  In all, he designed over 75 images advertising the periodical, each one small enough
  to hang in a store window. After his tenure with the magazine, Penfield went on
  to design advertisements for other publishers and manufacturers. "However, the scope
  of his career is not well-documented in this second phase, and the works of the
  first two decades of this century are more difficult to rediscover" (ibid, p. 17).
  This unusually-sized promotion for a novel features many of the images that Penfield
  used in his <i>Harper's</i> posters, such as the horse-drawn sleigh and the dapper
  figures. "Studying coach design and history was a favorite hobby [of the artist],
  and he later became a collector of these vehicles, and wrote about them for <i>Outing</i>
  magazine. The unfinished manuscript of a book on coaches survives among family papers"
  (ibid p. 13). Bustling street scenes also figure prominently in his work, such as
  the crowds of passersby in <i>People We Pass</i>, circa 1896, (Swann sale 2016,
  lot 84) and his poster for <i>Adler Suits & Overcoats</i> (Sale 2099, lot 124),
  which presents a very similar scene.
