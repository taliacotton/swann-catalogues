TYPESET: "The Palace Hotel in Montevideo was originally built in 1896 as a house, the Villa Sara. Tomas Clodomiro de Arteaga, owner of the newspaper <i>La Nación</i>, commissioned the project from Spanish architect Emilio Boix y Merino. It was purchased from the Arteaga family in 1907 by the Italian businessman Jaime Giacomo Molfino, who acquired the adjacent land in order to expand the facilities and transform it into a hotel. The Palace Hotel operated until 1944. Eventually, the property was sold to the Uruguayan State and became the location of the Sanitation Directorate of the Ministry of Public Works. For a time, the building housed units of the Armed Forces, until it was finally demolished in the 1970s."
