CROSSHEAD: TO BERLIN / AEF / SOS. Circa 1917.
at-a-glance: 46½x30 inches, 118x76¼ cm. Devambez, Paris.
TYPESET: What at first glance appears to be a soldier scrambling to get to Berlin,
  is in fact two soldiers, one white and the other black, hurrying together. The United
  States Army remained segregated during the First World War, but African Americans
  served in their own units in the American Expeditionary Force, and in some cases,
  fought side by side with French units. This <i>rare</i> image is one of the few
  World War I images to depict an African American soldier.

  overpainting in margins and image and along vertical and horizontal folds.'
