TYPESET: 'A <i>rare</i> Canadian World War I image imploring Jews to enlist in the
  army. This poster is an extraordinary call to arms, employing three separate persuasive
  techniques - patronizing expectation: "Britain expects every son of Israel to do
  his duty," historical association: "The Jews the world over love liberty, have fought
  for it & will fight for it," and following a visual example: the man pictured is
  saying "you have cut my bonds and set me free - now let me help you set others free!"
  This is the English version, it was also printed in Yiddish. Not in Magnes.'
