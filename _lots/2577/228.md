TYPESET: "One of at least two posters made promoting this documentary about a 57-minute flight taken on April 27, 1913; the other known image is a much smaller, vertical format piece (see Swann Sale 2467 Lot 298). The text on this poster explains that, \"these remarkable pictures were taken by Ray A. Durem from the hydro-aeroplane of the noted aviator Robert G. Fowler under unusual difficulties. Fowler made a daring flight across the isthmus from the Pacific to the Atlantic, so far the only aviator to make the journey. Shortly afterward, President Wilson issued an Executive Order forbidding such flights under heavy penalty. The photographs made on this flight, in themselves a notable achievement in motion photography, are probably the only pictures that will ever be taken of the canal from the air except for purposes of war.\""
FOOTNOTE: "Condition B+ / A-: minor repaired tears in margins; expertly-repaired tears, creases and minor restoration along vertical and horizontal folds; four-sheets."
