TYPESET: "This is one of a series of five Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee posters featuring the work of important civil rights photographer, Danny Lyon, while he was staff photographer for the committee. The poster was likely produced before the July 1963 introduction of zip codes, as the address has only the earlier two-digit city zone number. Lyon graduated from University of Chicago that same year with a BA in history. \"Personal participation in the lives of his subjects is a vital component to Danny Lyon's photography. His subjects often deviate from societal norms, yet he is dedicated to communicating their character and sensibility honestly, sympathetically, and nonjudgmentally\" (icp.org)."
FOOTNOTE: "Condition B+: restoration along repaired tears from bottom left edge, into central image; minor repaired tears at edges; repaired pin holes and overpainting in corners."
