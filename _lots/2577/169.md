TYPESET: "\"Georges Meunier was one of the painters of talent and charm . . . who are the smiling illustrators of their time. . . a pupil of Chéret . . . his philosophy of the poster was the same 'toujours les femmes et les rires' (Abdy p. 63). In this poster he clearly follows in Chéret's graphic footsteps, illustrating a charming, intimate scene in which an elegant young woman is smoking, while the black cat at her feet seems extremely curious - and probably impatient to play with the many packs of Job rolling paper on the floor. This image traditionally appears in a much larger format, with one image, rather than these two images side-by-side, presented within a decorative border formed out of the Job logo. <i>Rare</i>. Maitres pl. 167, DFP-II 579 (both var.)."
