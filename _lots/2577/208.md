TYPESET: Late in 1922, Schwitters and van Doesburg planned a small tour around the
  Netherlands with a traveling Dada show in order to introduce local artists to their
  work. The initial evening had been scheduled for December 27, but Schwitters had
  problems with his passport and the first show wasn't held until January 10. In all,
  there were 17 separate performances in 8 different locations. The first event was
  held at the Haagsche Kunstkring in the Hague. The address of the venue is included
  in the poster's upper right corner ("Haagsche K.K. Binnenhof 8"). For subsequent
  performances in other locations, the poster was slightly changed; this address was
  removed and a small plug for van Doesburg's Dada magazine, Mécano, was added that
  read, "Abonnement Mécano F5 per Jaar." Otherwise, the two versions of the poster
  are identical. The poster has the event program and Dada slogans - presented in
  sophisticated disorder using different hand drawn typography and font sizes. "The
  poster's discordant appearance reflects the tenor of many Dada evenings" (moma.org/learn).
