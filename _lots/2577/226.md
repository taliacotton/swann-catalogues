The new owners had these posters commissioned as a tribute to the historic vessel's illustrious past (among other things, it was the <i>SS France</i> that carried the <i>Mona Lisa</i> in 1962 when the painting went on an American tour). The posters in this series each graphically harken back to an earlier era."
