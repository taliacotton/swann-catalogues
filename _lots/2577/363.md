TYPESET: "Hockney, who is admired and collected as a contemporary artist, made brilliant contributions to the world of opera, as a stage and costume designer. He also designed numerous posters. Beginning in 1975 with his work for Stravinksy's <i>The Rake's Progress</i>, until 1990 when he worked on <i>Turandot</i>, Hockney worked for the major opera houses. Among his most memorable productions were Mozart's <i>Magic Flute</i> and Wagner's <i>Tristan and Isolde</i>. His collaboration with the Metropolitan Opera on Eric Satie's <i>Parade</i> is best-represented by this poster. The image, with Hockney's neo-pop décor and costumes, showcases a juggler whose contortions fit eye-catchingly into the poster's elongated format. If the opera itself is not so popular, this image has become a classic. Hockney 94."
