TYPESET: "The concept of \"Pleasure Cruising,\" as opposed to using a steamship to travel from one destination to another, was originated by Albert Ballin, the director of the Hamburg America Line. The first pleasure cruise was a 57-day Mediterranean tour that left Cuxhaven in 1891. While it is impossible to identify the ship on which these elegantly-attired travelers are enjoying a leisurely afternoon, the ship in the background is the <i>Deutschland</i> - the Hamburg America Line's only four-stacker, whose maiden voyage was in 1900. Schwormstädt was a painter and illustrator who worked for both the Hamburg America Line and North German Lloyd Bremen. This is the English version. Passenger Ships front end-paper (var), Monarchs p. 165, Chemnitz 449, DFP-III 3084 (var)."
