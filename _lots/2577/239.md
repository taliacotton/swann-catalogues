TYPESET: "From Bezombes' series of 16 Air France collage posters printed by Mourlot and mailed out in Air Mail cardboard envelopes. This previously-abandoned project by Bezombes, \"illustrating concepts and not destinations\" was discovered by Jean Signoret when he took control of advertising at Air France (Air France, p. 116). The artist's references to modern art were originally deemed too modern and unrelatable by the company's previous management. The series was published in 1981, but having been outshone in the press by the announcement of the new high speed train, it never received much attention (ibid.)."
