TYPESET: Bistolfi was an important Italian sculptor who is credited with having designed
  only this one poster. It promotes an art show in Turin that has become historically
  significant. Not only was it the first international exhibition of modern decorative
  art, but it was the show that launched the Liberty style in Italy. It is also considered
  by some to signify the beginning of the end of the Art Nouveau era, as it introduced
  elements of contemporary design that would slowly evolve into the De Stijl, Art
  Deco and Bauhaus schools. Regardless of the historical interpretation, the show
  highlighted some of the greatest European designers. Bistolifi's image is a captivating
  symbolic representation of muses dancing in a field. Clad in the flowing robes of
  antiquity, the bolt of fabric they carry spells out "Ars," art. This is the larger
  format and French version. Bolaffi p. 22, Manifesto 38, Maitres 1900 p. 125, Wember
  136.
