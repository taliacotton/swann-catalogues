TYPESET: "High atop the chalk cliffs of this small town in Normandy, lies a golf course that was designed in 1908, regarded as having one of the most spectacular views in the world, especially from its 10th hole. On top of the distant cliffs is the Chapelle Notre Dame de la Garde and the monument erected to Nungesser and Coli, two aviators whose airplane disappeared in 1927 as they attempted to make the first east-to-west Atlantic crossing. This motif of sporting equipment in repose in striking landscapes figures into several other well-known posters from the era, most notably in Pierre Commarmond's 1928 poster for Combloux. Galland studied at the École des Beaux-Arts and at the École des Arts Décoratifs and went on to work as an illustrator for Hachette. He specialized in children's publications but also designed posters as well as illustrations for other magazines. Although his poster work encompassed political propaganda and product advertising, he is best remembered for the bold colors and appealing designs of his travel posters. He received the Legion of Honor in 1933. Tennis p. 84."
