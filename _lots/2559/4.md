FOOTNOTE: "\"I do not think it advisable to disturb anything . . . about the Mora Grant. . . . I suppose you refer to the Prairie Cattle Co. If they do not buy immediately, they cannot buy at all, because it has already passed the House by a vote of 206 to 7 that no foreigner . . . shall purchase any lands hereafter in the United States territories. . . .\n\"I suppose that my buildings are sold to the Government. If they are we must get an office . . . . If I can get a good building on Capitol Hill cheap enough, I should be in favor of staying up there. . . .\n\"In that story about Paul and Mes there is not one word or shade of truth . . . . I don't know what there is in the western air that makes men lie so about what they see on a man's books, especially when the books will speak for themselves. The books will show that Paul gave to Ames $15,000.00 to go into a joint mining speculation instead of Ames giving anything to Paul. . . .\""
