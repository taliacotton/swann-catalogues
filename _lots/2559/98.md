pullquote: "STILL BITTER ABOUT \"THE RAINBOW\": \"I AM GLAD THERE IS NO MORE METHUEN\""
FOOTNOTE: "\"I send you the MS of another story--'The Miracle', which is beautiful and ends happily, so the swine of people ought to be very thankful for it.\n\"I am glad there is no more Methuen. You will do as you think best about the novel. I don't suppose anybody will be dying to publish it, though it is a chef d'oeuvre. Perhaps the faithful Duckworth will rise up & be noble: though I very much doubt his paying. . . .\n\"I shall be rather glad if nobody wants those little poems. Then I shall put them in the fire.\n\"It would be a good thing if Mitchell Kennerley sold all the rights to my things. He has swindled me unscrupulously. For everything of mine he has ever done, he has paid me only £10 . . . . I am sure the American rights of Sons & Lovers are worth more than £10 . . . .\n\"I am determined that I will have some money before long. I am sick of poking about in a corner, up to the neck in poverty. It is enough. I think America is my untilled field.\"\nPublished in The Letters of D.H. Lawrence, eds. Boulton and Robertson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), 3, #1354.\nIn 1915, soon after Methuen & Co. published Lawrence's The Rainbow, reviews criticized the novel's sexual content, and a court, finding the book obscene, ordered all copies destroyed. Methuen & Co. complied without offering any defense. Women in Love, Lawrence's sequel to The Rainbow, was published five years later--in America."
