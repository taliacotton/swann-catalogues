Oyster Bay, 26 January 1917.\nFranck Taylor Evans (1875-1934) was a U.S. Navy Captain and son of Rear Admiral Robley D. \"Fighting Bob\" Evans. In November of 1908, Evans was sentenced to loose 150 \"numbers\" and be publicly reprimanded for a number of infractions, including drunkenness on duty and treating with contempt his superior officer. Loss of numbers had the consequence of increasing the amount of time before voluntary retirement became available; it was a form of punishment abolished by President Clinton in 1999."
