Bata\" and below, the President's signature, followed by \"General / 22 October 1986\" also in his hand. \n\nThere was also issued a signed limited edition of 275 printed on vellum. We have located a few other presentation copies that have appeared on the market signed by Zia as President to dignitaries around the same time as this including a copy inscribed to American Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and another the following year to Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra, with both of these copies appearing to be the regular issue, as here. Thomas J. Bata was the son of the founder of the multi-national Bata Shoe Company, certainly the most ubiquitous post-war footwear brand in the whole of South Asia. This copy sourced from the Bata Shoe Museum."
