pullquote: "\"THERE IS ANOTHER CASE OF COMPOUND FRACTURE UNDER MY CARE JUST NOW\""
FOOTNOTE: "\". . . I have a continued good report to give of the compound fracture, which is indeed now no longer a case of uncertainty: So I have made up my mind to publish on the subject, and intend running in to Edinburgh tomorrow afternoon to consult with Mr. Sprue as to the best medium for publication.\n\"There is another case of compound fracture under my care just now, with a very extreme wound, but it is too early yet to say if the carbolic acid, which has been applied to it, is going to succeed. But I rather fear from the appearance today, three days after the accident, that suppuration will take place. If I were to treat just such a case again, I should proceed rather differently, using the acid more freely. Thee will be glad to learn that we have at length broken ground on Gilmorehill, the site for the new College. . . .\""
