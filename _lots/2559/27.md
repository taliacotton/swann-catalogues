pullquote: "\"THOSE WHO WANT TO DO HUMANITARIAN SERVICE NEED NOT JOIN ANY RED CROSS SOCIETY\""
FOOTNOTE: "\". . . Red Cross work I love. I did it during the Boer War & again during what was then called the Zulu rebellion and yet again during the late war. . . . Therefore I do not need any demonstration of the value of such work. But organised Red Cross work has as much a humanitarian as a political side to it. It is part of the war machinery. As an out and out war resister, I cannot identify myself with it. I have, therefore . . . opposed people . . . joining the Indian Red Cross Society. But I have done no propaganda against it. I have guided those who have asked my opinion. Those who want to do humanitarian service need not join any Red Cross Society. . . . Like the Good Samaritan they will have excellent opportunities of rendering silent service whenever it comes their way. . . . In happier times I should carry on propaganda for introducing genuine Red Cross work as part of the education syllabus at its early stage so that a young lad or lass of 15 years would be able to render first aid to any person who is in need of it.\""
