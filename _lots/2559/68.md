FOOTNOTE: "Between 1967 and 1969, Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerome Robbins, and John Guare collaborated on creating a musical adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play, The Exception and the Rule. Bernstein wrote eight songs for the show, one of whose working titles was A Pray by Blecht; it was scheduled to open at the Broadhurst Theater in February of 1969 starring Zero Mostel and produced by Stuart Ostrow. The show never opened. Robbins made another attempt in 1987, this time under the title, The Race to Urga, but after a brief workshop production, it, too, failed to reach the stage in final form."
