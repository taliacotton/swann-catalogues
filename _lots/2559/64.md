FOOTNOTE: "1 June 1915: \". . . I won a good deal of a victory and really I am especially glad of it because it leaves me free to fight for our army and our navy and proper national policies, as the opportunity arrives. But don't make any mistake as to my being a candidate again. I have accumulated altogether too many enemies. Lord, how I would like to see this country's foreign policy properly managed and above all to see her take a proper view as to the naval and military needs! . . .\"\nWhen Roosevelt founded the Progressive Party in 1912, he divided the Republican party of which he had been the leader. After the Progressives failed to win the presidency that year and had diminishing success in later elections, Roosevelt strived for a reconciliation with the Republicans as the 1915 presidential election approached, outraging both Republicans and Progressives. The \"victory\" Roosevelt refers to in this letter is likely not political: on May 22, Roosevelt had won a five-week libel suit brought against him which had consumed his attention at a time when historic events were taking place, most importantly, the sinking of the Lusitania on May 7 by a German U-Boat, pressuring President Wilson into joining the war that Roosevelt had supported for some time."
