FOOTNOTE: "Although Einstein had remarkable success in explaining certain aspects of physical reality, he and other physicists sought to discover a grand theory to explain all the fundamental forces, including especially electromagnetism and gravitation. With the success of quantum mechanics at explaining the subatomic realm despite its lack of a single consistent model of reality, most physicists abandoned the pursuit for a unified field theory, but Einstein persisted unsuccessfully until his death."
