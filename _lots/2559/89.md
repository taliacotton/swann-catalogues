pullquote: "\"FIND OUT IF THE GRAND DUKE REALLY RECEIVED MY LETTER\""
FOOTNOTE: "\"Would it be possible for you to find out if the Grand Duke really received my letter from the beginning of the month?\n\"I understand . . . that the Grand Duke has been otherwise occupied with the Congress of Princes, which was convened in the meantime . . . . Only one thing worries me: namely the possibility that he didn't receive the letter at all. . . .\"\nAlthough the entire cycle of Der Ring des Nibelungen was not completed until 1869, Wagner began soliciting financing for performances of the work from Friedrich I, Grand Duke of Baden, beginning in 1857, when Wagner completed the second act of Siegfried. Wagner was also in contact with Karl Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, for the same purpose; thus, it is unclear which duke is being referred to in the present letter.\nOn August 1, 1863, in Frankfurt am Main, the Congress of Princes was convened to reform the German Confederation."
