FOOTNOTE: "27 September 1915: \". . . [Y]ou can count on me to do anything I can to ameliorate your loss of seniority.\n\". . . As you probably know . . . I . . . recommended a comprehensive scheme for promotion by competition. . . . [T]he competition is based on three factors in the case of lieutenant commanders. . . . Professional examination, service record . . . , and service reputation . . . .\n\". . . I am personally inclined to believe that Congress will be so impressed with the need of additional officers that they will give us a material increase in numbers which would apply largely to the grade of commander. . . .\"\n14 July 1917: \"Somebody . . . showed me today a letter from you, asking that we should not name one of the new destroyers after your father. I am sorry, but the Secretary approved the list of new destroyers about ten days ago and one of them was down to be called the EVANS. I fear I am partly responsible, as I submitted a proposed list . . . and perhaps I should have written to you about it beforehand . . . .\"\nWith--Two items: a typed copy of a letter from Evans to Roosevelt, arguing that the name of his father would be disgraced if associated with a Navy ship, since at least one such ship is named for a coward and a liar. 2 pages, 4to. \"U.S.S. Charleston,\" 7 August 1917 â€¢ Western Union telegram from Roosevelt to Mrs. Evans expressing sympathy upon the death of F.T. Evans. 1 page, 5x8 inches; all edges chipped. Washington, 9 March 1934.\nFranck Taylor Evans (1875-1934) was a U.S. Navy Captain and son of Rear Admiral Robley D. \"Fighting Bob\" Evans. In November of 1908, Evans was sentenced to loose 150 \"numbers\" and be publicly reprimanded for a number of infractions, including drunkenness on duty and treating with contempt his superior officer. Loss of numbers had the consequence of increasing the amount of time before voluntary retirement became available; it was a form of punishment abolished by President Clinton in 1999."
