at-a-glance: "London: The Egoist Press, 1922"
TYPESET: "8vo, bound in full green cloth, spine stamped in black, minor rubbing to extremities; half-title and title stabilized with glassine backing, printer's credit leaf at end (terminal) soiled and backed on paper, edges browned as often seen, bound without original wrappers. Out-of-series copy, one of 2000 copies issued on handmade paper.</i> This is effectively the second impression of the First Edition, printed by Darantiere from the First Edition plates as soon as that edition was exhausted. It was printed for Joyce's patron Harriet Weaver, who was unable to find a printer in England, and distributed mainly by Rodker and Ezra Pound, working from Paris. At least 500 copies were intercepted by U.S. Customs, and this issue has since become less common than the First Edition. Slocum & Cahoon A18."
