TYPESET: "8vo, publisher's illustrated wrappers, slight lean, minor stains and scratches, faint vertical reading cracks to spine; minor moisture stain to portion of fore-edges. True first edition.</i> [And:] <i>Another copy.</i> 8vo, publisher's wrappers, cocked, corners turned slightly, scattered soiling, joints and backstrip tips rubbed; erased ownership inscription to title; usual browning to contents. Second edition, published one month after the first, with this edition notable in that it represents the original cover design intended by the author. To rush the first edition to press, Sudamericana disregarded the image created by the author's friend in Mexico City and instead printed covers bearing an unauthorized image that García Márquez intensely disliked. Buenos Aires, 1967."
