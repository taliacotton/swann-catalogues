FOOTNOTE: "\"I also think that it is the better solution to try to get transferred to Brussels--in this way I see that his life would be a little different than before. From what he wrote me regarding writing to Cartarini, I didn't think it would be good to entrust what you wanted to writing. These were things to be said in person, and I hoped to do it . . . . And for now I have nothing of that which you remind me in the works, having turned down all commissions for music. I had forgotten about Grandei; tell him the famous lock never arrived. I received greetings from his son, but not having the paternal address, I didn't answer. So now good old Orsini is in Brussels . . . . I have to work, but I don't feel like it. I have had a thousand annoyances and disturbances, and then my health was not so good; I'm better now. Elvira and Tonio are still in Milan. Many regards to you and Grandei.\""
