FOOTNOTE: "\". . . Your Acceptance of a Seat in Congress was an unexpected Pleasure as I was informed you had utterly declined it. Indeed your long Service might have intitled you to claim some Indulgence, but it is the more generous in you to waive it, & your Experience now enables you to render more important Service. I was appointed without my Concurrence & with express Leave to consult my private Affairs which I must do to a considerate Degree if Congress remains at Trenton. But the Gentlemen in the Delegation conform so generally in Sentiment with each other & with those Interests which I particularly respect that I have the less Concern on that Head. You will find them Men of Principle & possessing Such Ideas of Government as I think you approve. I had heard of the Candidate for the Treasury & think with you a better may be found.\n\"Mr. [Charles] Pettit's Talents lay in that Line & he is a Man of Principle. Take him in Temper[ance], Skill in Acc[oun]ts & real Integrity, I do not think he has many superiors in this Country. I do not know the Value of the Appointment but I believe I will accept it if the Scale is not too parsimonious. . . .\""
