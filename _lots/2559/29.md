FOOTNOTE: "\"Thank you for your good letter; but I will not show it to my wife who is sorry about what is happening, and whom congratulations exasperate. She may be right, . . . had I not had to make an immediate decision . . . , I would have given a different answer to the unexpected proposal . . . . I did indeed make one objection, in light of my scientific career, which I should not and will not abandon, but . . . I had to give in.\n\"In addition, . . . I will remain very proud that I was chosen by the left, no doubt because I am a republican but specifically as a man of science.\"\nIn early 1880, Broca was granted an honorary position in the French Senate for life (s√©nateur inamovible); he died from a brain hemorrhage months later on July 9."
