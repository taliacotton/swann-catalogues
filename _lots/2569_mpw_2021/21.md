  a group of artists began meetings and formed the American Abstract Artists group
  in 1937. As one voice, they overcame the exclusion faced by modernist American artists
  from museum and gallery exhibitions, and funded shows of their own. Amongst the
  founding members were Ibram Lassaw, Carl Holty, Charles Green Shaw, Werner Drewes,
  John Opper, and Giorgio Cavallon. Later members also include John Little, Judith
  Rothschild, and Sidney Gordin.</p>"
