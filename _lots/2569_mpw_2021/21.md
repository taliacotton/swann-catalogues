  studio of sculptor Ibram Lassaw, a group of artists began meetings and formed the
  American Abstract Artists group in 1937. As one voice, they overcame the exclusion
  faced by modernist American artists from museum and gallery exhibitions, and funded
  shows of their own. Amongst the founding members were Ibram Lassaw, Carl Holty,
  Charles Green Shaw, Werner Drewes, John Opper, and Giorgio Cavallon. Later members
  also include John Little, Judith Rothschild, and Sidney Gordin.</p>"
