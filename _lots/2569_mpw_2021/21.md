Signed, <i>Lassaw,</i> and dated, <i>1943,</i> lower right. <br><br>In pursuit of an uniquely American modernist style, some artists objected to Hilla Rebay's purist ideals of abstraction, void of recognizable subject matter.  In 1936, at the studio of sculptor Ibram Lassaw, a group of artists began meetings and formed the American Abstract Artists group. As one voice, they overcame the exclusion faced by modernist American artists from museum and gallery exhibitions, and funded shows of their own.  Amongst the founding members were Ibram Lassaw, Carl Holty, Charles Green Shaw, Werner Drewes, John Opper, and Giorgio Cavallon. Later members also include John Little, Judith Rothschild, and Sidney Gordin."
