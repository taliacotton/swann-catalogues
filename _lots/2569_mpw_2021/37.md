In the mid-1950s until the late 1960s, Rothschild's work shows strong influence from her mentor, Karl Knaths.  <i>Nauset Heights III</i> is a breaking point in her career.  Though she would retain the Ostwald Color System learned from Knaths, she begins to eliminate the use of hard line, and fractured picture plane."
