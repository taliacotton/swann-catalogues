  In the mid-1950s until the late 1960s, Rothschild's work shows strong influence
  from her mentor, Karl Knaths. <em>Nauset Heights III</em> is a breaking point in
  her career. Though she would retain the Ostwald Color System learned from Knaths,
  she begins to eliminate the use of hard line, and fractured picture plane so defining
  in the works of Knaths throughout his career.</p>"
