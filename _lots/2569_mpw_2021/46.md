  The artist; Thence by descent: Acquired from the son of the artist by the current

  mainly portraiture and cityscapes. During the active years of the Works Progress
  Administration Federal Art Project, (WPA/FAP) Bodin was employed under the easel
  painting division. Through his association with Adolph Gottlieb, Milton Avery, and
  artists often refered to as color field painters, he began gravitating toward an
  abstract format, and in the second half of the 1940s he found his mature style,
  represented here as lots 46 and 47.</p>"
