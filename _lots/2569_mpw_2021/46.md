  Bodin began his career painting representational subject matter, mainly portraiture
  and cityscapes. During the active years of the Works Progress Administration Federal
  Art Project, (WPA/FAP) Bodin was employed under the easel painting division. Through
  his association with Adolph Gottlieb, Milton Avery, and artists often refered to
  as color field painters, he began gravitating toward an abstract format, and in
  the second half of the 1940s he found his mature style, represented here as lots
  46 and 47.
