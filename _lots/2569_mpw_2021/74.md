CROSSHEAD: "Untitled."
year: ""
TYPESET: "Metal foil tape and acrylic sheets in a metal frame, c. 1970. 1067x1067 mm; 42x42 inches. <br><br>Provenance: Commissioned by Leslie and Cay Bell, Bethesda, MD; thence by descent to the current owner. <br><br>James Hilleary spent most of his life in the Washington DC area, and is often included in listings of the DC Color Field artists.  His exploration in color and striped formats was arrived at independently, yet he was exhibited at important DC galleries that emphasized DC Color Field, such as Henri Gallery, and the artist owned and operated Studio Gallery founded in 1956 by artist Jeannie Lea Knight. Hilleary lived a life of dual careers as both a painter and an architect.  This work was conceived, site specific, for an opening between rooms in the second home of the Bell family, and is meant to be viewed from both sides."
