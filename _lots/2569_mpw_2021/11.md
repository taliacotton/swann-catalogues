Her goals, shared by Rudolf Bauer, were to promote Non-Objective art in America, and to find a patron of means to collect and help promote this artistic concept.  Solomon R. Guggenheim would be that patron. Rebay at his side and Bauer as their agent in Germany, Guggenheim established a foundation, amassed a collection of Non-Objective art and would eventually house his collection in The Museum of Non-Objective Painting, with Hilla Rebay as his director. <br><br>Solomon R. Guggenheim's foundation, with Hilla Rebay at the helm, gave stipends to artists and encouraged their pursuit of pure abstraction.  Many artists benefited from this program, including Rudolf Bauer, Rolph Scarlett, Irene Rice Pereira, Alice Mattern, and Penrod Centurion."
