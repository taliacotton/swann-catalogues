Shaw,</i> and dated, <i>1940,</i> on verso.<br><br>Provenance: Estate of the artist; Private collection, NY. <br><br>Charles Green Shaw was a founding member of the American Abstract Artists group.  Unlike many of his peers, he possessed the means to travel to Europe and witness Modernist art first hand in the studios and salons of Paris and beyond.  This work is a great example of Shaw finding his own language within the greater conversation of expression through line, form, and color.  A study for <i>Sight</i> is in the collection of The National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, accession number 2015.19.2556."
