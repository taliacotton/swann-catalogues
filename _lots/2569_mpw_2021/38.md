  PA. <br><br>This work is registered with the Judith Rothschild Foundation (no. 85.10).
  <br><br>In Rothschild's <em>Sheild of Achilles</em>, and <em>Eidolon</em> series,
  we can clearly see her influence from Pierre Matisse's Cutout work. Judith Rothschild
  saw the Henri Matisse Retrospective at Grand Palais, Paris in 1970. The luscious
  figurative forms employed in her works of the 1980s are broken down and rearranged
  as abstract elements within the overall composition.</p>"
