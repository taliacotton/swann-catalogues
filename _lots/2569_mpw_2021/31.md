  Gruenebaum Gallery, Ltd., NY. <br><br>As the looming threats of World War II increased
  the likelihood of an American role in the conflict, government attention to the
  Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project, and the funding dried up. Many
  artists were left with little options for showing their work. In New York City artists
  began formal gatherings, initiated by artist Philip Pavia, at 39 East 8th Street.
  These gatherings would become known as The Club, and the discussions would reach
  fruition when these artists collectively organized and held an exhibition in 1951
  called The 9th Street Show. This show is seen by many as the beginning of Abstract
  Expressionism and The New York School. Following the success of The 9th Street Show,
  galleries began opening close by, notably, Hansa Gallery, and Tanager Gallery. Stable
  Gallery opened in 1953 on West 58th Street. <br><br>Artists with works in this auction
