TYPESET: "An excellent piece of American anti-Nazi propaganda intended for use in Italy. Most likely, this image was released late in 1943, a time when the Italian Government was in convulsions. Late that July, Mussolini was ousted and Pietro Badoglio elevated to Prime Minister; on September 3rd a secret armistice between Italy and the Allied forces was signed and publicly announced on September 8th. Then, on October 13th, Italy declared war on Germany. Two months after he was arrested, German forces were able to free Mussolini and install him as head of a new Fascist state in Northern Italy. Italy was embroiled in a civil war. This poster, \"Out with the Germans,\" one of at least two American propaganda images with the same title, was likely released as the Allied forces moved north towards Rome, and the Germans tried to solidify their positions in the north of the country. IWM PST 0035."
