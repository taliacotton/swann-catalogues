TYPESET: "The attitude of the Japanese toward marketing ingeniousness allowed Yokoo a kind of artistic freedom he would have been hard pressed to find in Western economies, where marketing often acts to censor creativity. Here, Yokoo announces the publication of a serialized essay by Yukio Mishima (the pen name of Kimitake Hiraoka, one of the major Japanese avant-garde authors of the 20th century). The image combines such classical Japanese graphic elements as the rising sun and a great wave, with a Western-style locomotive and pin-up girl. Yokoo additionally designed book covers and other posters for the author as well. Aside from his literary legacy, Mishima is also known for having committed traditional suicide after a failed military coup. Yokoo 356, Yokoo / Veyrier p. 6, MoMA 697.1966."
