TYPESET: "This image is so similar in style to the early work of Ludwig Hohlwein, involving solid planes of color, no outlining and a geometric pattern on the shawl, that it has frequently been misattributed to him. The product is corn coffee, produced by Heinrich Franck Sohne GmbH; the image of \"the Kornfranck Aunt\" is one of wholesome maternal comfort, suggesting that this ersatz coffee has connections to the traditions of the past. DFP-III 1431, Hohwlein / Stuttgart 433, Hohlwein / Munich 178-16, German Expressionist Art 33."
FOOTNOTE: "Condition B: repaired tears at edges; creases and abrasions at edges and in image; margins and printer's information trimmed off. Mounted on Japan."
