TYPESET: "A key figure in Swiss graphic design and international typography, Ernst Keller taught at the Kunstgewerbe Schule in Zurich from 1918 until he retired in 1956, imparting his key tenets of simplicity and legibility to two generations of Swiss designers. Keller designed a version of this poster in 1926 (for an earlier exhibition), with the two primary colors inverted. Two years later, with the exhibition held in a different venue, he revamped the earlier design. Using bold, sans-serif typography, he organized the space to provide impeccable legibility. This poster served as a model for many designers who continued to use the same system for decades. Muller-Brockmann no. 139 (var), MoMA 877.1979."
