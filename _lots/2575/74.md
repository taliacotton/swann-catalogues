  Pennsylvania.<br><br>Betts (1873-1961) was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, and received
  his training from his artist father before studying portrait painting at the Pennsylvania
  Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia.  He won the Cresson Scholarship, which allowed
  him to study abroad for two years in Europe, where he painted society portraits
  of the upper class.  When he returned to the United States, he continued to build
  his career painting portraits of prominent society members.  This bold study of
  a nude model, with a silk robe over her left shoulder, while not unusual in his
  <i>ouevre</i>, was an infrequent subject for Betts, it is also among the largest
  nude studies by the artist to be offered at auction.
