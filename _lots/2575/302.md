Signed in ink, verso.<br><br>Ex-collection private collection, New York.<br><br>The Larry Rivers Foundation does not have record of this work in their archives; they can neither confirm nor reject the attribution.<br><br>Rivers (1923-2002) trained to become a Jazz musician, but in the late 1940s, after being exposed to Cubism and studying with Hans Hofmann for two years, redirected himself toward the fine arts.  In 1950, he met the poet Frank O'Hara, beginning a lifelong association with various literary figures (Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg among them), and had his first one-man exhibition at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery, New York.<br><br>Rivers's early work reveals foremost Abstract Expressionist tendencies, albeit with the appropriation of various everyday objects that both influenced and brought him closer to the Pop art movement.  His artistic style was perhaps best summed up by Andy Warhol, who mused, \"Larry's painting style was unique--it wasn't Abstract Expressionism and it wasn't Pop, it fell into the period in between.  But his personality was very Pop.\""
