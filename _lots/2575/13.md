  the artist; Wortsman-Rowe Gallery, San Francisco (<i>Ano 1719—Armir</i> with the
  label); private collection, Florida.<br><br>Carlsen (1848-1932) used drawing to
  record color information, draw contours for transfer to a painting or as a pre-sketch
  before inking.  Most of his drawings were destroyed once used to transfer to the
  canvas, so very few have survived. <i>Study of a House</i> possibly portrays William
  Merritt Chases'' homestead in Shinnecock, New York; he often stayed with Chase (1849-1916)
  from around 1876 until he met Julian Alden Weir (1852-1919) and spent time at Weir''s
  home in Connecticut. The house is found in other works by Carlsen. The figural study
  verso is a grid drawing with contour for transfer or enlargement, and is similar
  to those he made around 1896-97 after studying in Paris with Antoine Vollon, which
  were similar to the French artist''s in style.  The other drawing, <i>Ano 1719 Arm''s
  Jr.</i>, likely represents a bar or tavern in Boston, or possibly, England.'
