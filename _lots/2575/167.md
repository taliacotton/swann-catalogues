  New York. <br><br>Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Young (1877-1957) was the grandson
  of Brigham Young (1801-1877).  He began to sculpt as a child and showed himself
  to be a precocious young talent.  Young settled in New York and attended The Art
  Students League and the prestigious Académie Julian in Paris.  The subjects of his
  work, rendered in the Social Realist style, were industrial laborers and construction
  workers who transformed New York.  Young's proposal to the Society of Medalists,
  who issued cast medals approximately twice a year, was selected by the committee
  and he was awarded the 30th issue.
