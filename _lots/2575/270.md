Signed and dated in ink, lower right recto.<br><br>Ex-collection private collection, Chicago.<br><br>Lassiter (1926-2005) was a reclusive artist who rarely left his New York apartment, isolating himself from news and current events, absorbing the energy and chaos of the city during infrequent outings.  He eschewed Abstract Expressionism and rejected trends of Minimalism and Pop Art and produced lively, surreal figurative work in line with the visions of Jean Dubuffet and Paul Klee.  Early in his career, his work was featured in an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, \"Recent Drawings,\" April 25-August 5, 1956, and in addition to The MoMA, his works can be now found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Brooklyn Museum, New York;  Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven; Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, and the Collection de l’Art Brut in Lausanne, Switzerland."
