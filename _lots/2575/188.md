TYPESET: "Oil on canvas, 1937.  745x1050 mm; 29⅜x41⅜ inches.  Signed and dated in oil, lower right recto and inscribed \"11\" in ink, verso.  <br><br>Ex-collection private collection, New Jersey.<br><br>Philbrick (1879-1964) was born in Utica, New York, but raised in Winnetka, Illinois and studied at the Art Institue of Chicago before traveling to Paris to study at the Académie Julian and Académie Colarossi.  He spent summers near Damariscotta, Maine, which was often the inspiration for his work. The years of 1932-42 are considered his most innovative period and the last years during which he painted in oil, using brilliant colors and switching between the brush and the palette knife.  His subject matter focused mainly on small towns and landscape during the Great Depression, evincing hints of the struggle of its inhabitants despite the overall compositions appearing peaceful."
