  Lincoln Kirstein, New York; the estate of Lincoln Kirstein, New York; gifted to
  Jack Woody, publisher, Twelvetrees Press, Pasadena (Woody published Kirstein''s
  <em>Quarry: A Collection in Lieu of Memoirs</em>, 1986, and was also an early publisher
  of George Platt Lynes photographs; his <em>George Platt Lynes: Photographs 1931-1955</em>,
  1981, with an introductory text by Kirstein, is a photography book icon; private
  collection, New Mexico.<br><br>Tooker (1920-2011) was born in Brooklyn and, after
  graduating from Harvard University with an English degree in 1942 and enlisting
  in the Officer Candidates School, United States Marine Corps (he was discharged
  for medical reasons), studied at the Art Students League, New York, from 1943 to
  1945 under the artists Reginald Marsh and Kenenth Hayes Miller. Tooker met Paul
  Cadmus at the Art Students League and through Cadmus was introduced to Jared and
  Margaret French, all of whom would work together, collaborate and become lifelong
  friends in the ensuing decades. Through his connection with Cadmus and French, Tooker
  also became closely acquainted with Monroe Wheeler and Lincoln Kirstein, both of
  whom had strong ties to the nascent Museum of Modern Art, New York.<br><br>In 1946,
  in large part due to Kirstein''s influence, Tooker was included in the groundbreaking
  exhibition "Fourteen Americans" curated by Dorothy Miller, at The Museum of Modern
  Art, which was a significant success in his early career. Three years later, following
  a half year of travel through Italy and France, studying old masters and architecture
  with Cadmus, Tooker participated in the exhibition "Symbolic Realism," 1949-50,
  organized by Kirstein, which brought him further recognition; the same year <em>The
  Subway</em>, egg tempera on panel, 1950, was acquired by the Whitney Museum of American
  Art, New York, his first painting to enter a museum collection. He had his first
  solo exhibition the following year at the Edwin Hewitt Gallery, New York.<br><br>Like
  Cadmus and French, Tooker was categorized by art critics as a "Magic Realist," though
  he resisted this label. He said of his work, "I am after painting reality impressed
  on the mind so hard that it returns as a dream, but I am not after painting dreams
  as such, or fantasy." Describing his process, he noted, "I don''t really think I''m
  a creator. I feel that I''m a passive vessel, a receptor or translator . . . The
  fascinating thing about painting is the discovery." Tooker''s work gradually fell
  out of the spotlight with the ascent of Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art and Minimalism
  in the decades following the 1950s, though he continued to paint in the assiduous
  style he had developed during his early career.<br><br>The death of his partner,
  the artist and activist William R. Christopher, in 1973, prompted his conversion
  to Catholicism and a deeper spirituality in his work thereafter. Tooker''s work
  was rediscovered during the 1980s and his appeal widened starting with his representation
  by DC Moore Gallery, New York, in the late 1990s and the exhibition "George Tooker:
  A Retrospective," at the National Academy Museum, New York; Pennsylvania Academy
  of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia; and Columbus Museum of Art, Ohio, in 2008-09. He
  spent the last decades of his career focusing on his art and spiritual life in relative
  solitude at his home in rural Vermont. Tooker received the prestigious National
  Medal of Arts in 2007; he died at home in April 2011.<br><br>Although Tooker had
  begun to experiment with egg tempera early in his career through Marsh at the Art
  Students League, it was both Cadmus and French who encouraged him to adopt it as
  his primary medium. The technique had close ties to Renaissance painting, which
  all three artists emulated, and was the primary panel painting medium for nearly
  every painter in the European Medieval and Early Renaissance period up to 1500.
  Tempera is a quick-drying, tedious and unforgiving method of painting that is hard
  to change after being applied. This deliberate method suited Tooker''s disposition
  and artistic theory. He spent several intensely-focused hours each day, most days
  a week, for roughly four months fine-tuning each piece, slowly and deliberately
  building up color and dimension. He mixed his colors by hand, using water, egg yolk
  and powdered pigment.<br><br>Tooker''s images convey a sense of overwhelming silence,
  as in the current painting, and the figures he depicts are rarely overcome by emotion
  and seldom convey individuality. Although in this work, the features of the male,
  with the large, dark eyes, prominent brown, round face, full lips and close-cropped
  hair bear a striking resemblance to Tooker in his twenties, and the style of the
  dress worn by the woman is one frequently modeled by Magaret French in numerous
  1940s/1950s PaJaMa photographs (the moniker "PaJaMa" is a portmanteau of the first
  two letters of Paul, Jared and Margaret which the three artists used to reflect
  a fluid and collective mode of authorship in their photography). Tooker''s work
  is grounded with a precise geometric architecture, which is both a gesture to the
  ubiquitous use of perspective in Renaissance art and a recognition of the order
  and rigidty of modern architecture. In the current work, the scaffold, playground-like
  frame is similar to one seen in PaJaMa photographs from the 1940s and 1950s, on
  which Cadmus and Jared and Margaret French often posed for photographs, on the beach
  at Fire Island, New York.</p><p>We would place the current painting among a number
  of works which Garver refers to as "summer pictures" which the artist seems to have
  conceived as, "Pleasures of the past--of childhood--recalled by Tooker in his paintings
  as one might recall the memory of a special celebration, special because of its
  distinctness from everyday life." The figure of the youth with arms raised and holding
  onto the scaffold structure in the current work is posed similarly and bears a striking
  resemblance to the boy in <em>Divers</em>, egg tempera on gesso panel, 1951-52.
  Garver adds that <em>Divers</em>, "Bears a strong resemblance to <em>Bathers</em>
  and to <em>Coney Island</em> in its use of wooden planking as a major compositional
  and framing element. For Tooker, it is a happy picture, and the thin figure on the
  ladder is an acknowledged self-portrait. It is one of Tooker''s most schematized
  paintings," (Garver, <em>George Tooker</em>, San Francisco, 1992, page 74, illustrated
  pages 74 and 76). In the current work, Tooker used the geometric scaffold structure
  and the shadows it casts on the ground to echo the compositional framing element
  of the wood planking in these other paintings. Moreover, the red bathing suits worn
  by the youths in <em>Divers</em> and <em>Acrobats</em>, egg tempera on gesso panel,
  1950-52, match that in the current painting, and the female model in the <em>Garden
  Party</em>, egg tempera on gesso panel, 1952, another of Tooker''s "summer pictures,"
  appears to be the identical model wearing the same red dress as in the current work.</p>'
