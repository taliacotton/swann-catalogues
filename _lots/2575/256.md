Initialed and dated in oil, lower right recto.<br><br>Ex-collection private collection, New Jersey.<br><br>Grant (1912-1991) studied at the Dayton Art Institute, Ohio and the National Academy of Design, New York.  He was interested in non-objective art early in his career; when he started a teaching job in 1935 at Wittenberg College in Ohio, he was convinced it was \"part of the earth itself.\" While at Wittenberg, he channeled most of his creativity into stage sets and became interested in experimental film.  He wrote to Hilla Rebay (1890-1967), director of the Museum of Non-Objective Painting (now the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum), which led to him moving to New York to work at the museum while also furthering his own artistic practice, which included experimental filmmaking as well as painting."
