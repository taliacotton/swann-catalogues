  private collection, New Jersey.<br><br>One of several prominent women associated
  with the artistic life of Cincinnati at the turn of the century, Sykes (1855-1931)
  specialized in colorful, Impressionist-inspired watercolors. She was born in Brookline,
  Massachusetts; her father was a silversmith and engraver, and her mother was a gifted
  needleworker. Stimulated by the artistic example of her parents, Sykes studied at
  the Lowell Institute in Boston in 1875 and enrolled at the school of the Museum
  of Fine Arts in 1878. She married in 1882 and moved with her husband to Cincinnati,
  at that time a flourishing cultural center dubbed the "Queen City of the West."
  In order to refine her artistic skills, she enrolled at the Cincinnati Art Academy
  in 1884. Throughout the next decade, she continued her training under such notable
  American painters as Frank Duveneck and Thomas Satterwhite Noble. Although she occasionally
  worked in oil, watercolor became Sykes' favorite medium of expression.<br><br>She
  was a regular contributor to the annual exhibitions of the Boston Art Club, New
  York Watercolor Club, Art Institute of Chicago, the Philadelphia Water Color Club
  and the Ohio Water Color Society. In 1892, she became a charter member of the Woman's
  Art Club of Cincinnati. Over a three-decade-long period, Sykes exhibited at the
  Cincinnati Art Museum on forty-two occasions.</p>
