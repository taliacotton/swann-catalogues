  Burt Chernow, Westport, Connecticut; Harvey Koizim, Westport, Connecticut; Collection
  of the County Federal Bank, Westport, Connecticut; private collection, Fairfield
  County, Connecticut, circa 1987.<br><br>Moran (1829-1901) emigrated from England
  to the United States in the 1840s and lived through the turbulence of the mid-19th
  century and the Civil War. He came from a prominent family of American artists;
  two of his brothers were Thomas Moran (1837-1926), the painter and printmaker of
  the Hudson River School, and Peter Moran (1841-1914, see lot 27).<br><br>In this
  work by Moran, which allegorizes a country torn apart by civil war, the fallen mast
  floats in the harbor while the crew gathers on the deck around the remnants of the
  mast. There is a solitary figure who represents President Abraham Lincoln on the
  main deck. The flag lies inverted, a mariner's sign of distress, high in the rigging
  above.</p>"
