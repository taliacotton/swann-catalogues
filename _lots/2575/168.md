During his tenure at the newspaper, he consistently championed traditionalism and decried modernism.  While he typically vilified European modernists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh and Piet Mondrian, referring to them as \"egotists,\" he held less scorn for American modernists like Arthur B. Davies, Guy Pène du Bois and Georgia O'Keeffe, who used traditional techniques."
