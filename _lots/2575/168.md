TYPESET: Bronze medal, 1940.  103 mm; 4¼ inches (diameter).<br><br>Ex-collection private
  collection, New York.<br><br>Cortissoz (1869-1948) was an American art historian
  and from 1891 until his death, the art critic for the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>.  During
  his tenure at the newspaper, he consistently championed traditionalism and decried
  modernism.  While he typically vilified European modernists such as Pablo Picasso,
  Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh and Piet Mondrian, referring to them as "egotists,"
  he held less scorn for American modernists like Arthur B. Davies, Guy Pène du Bois
  and Georgia O'Keeffe, who used traditional techniques.
