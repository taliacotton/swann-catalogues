A Hollywood-based artist, BEAU was born in Oakland, California and studied art and costume design at the University of California, Berkeley before moving to Hollywood where he worked as a costume designer for television, film, and theatre. After a magazine editor spotted his erotic art, he was convinced to expand his efforts under a pseudonym. BEAU’s work, saturated in color and reminiscent of American realist painting, has appeared in various publications and media, including Advocate Men, Freshmen, and Torso."
