  this drawing. He was an American underground artist of gay erotic art whose career
  began in the 1930s and is best known for his 1948 series of drawings "The Barn."
  Like many artists, his work was initially distributed underground as a result of
  American obscenity laws. His first one-man show was held at the Leslie-Lohman Gallery
  in SoHo in November of 1980. Its success launched him into greater popularity and
  his most artistically productive decade. Bate died on June 27, 1989, the twentieth
  anniversary of the Stonewall riot.
