Signed in ink, lower right.Provenance: Gifted from the playwright William Hoffman to producer John Glines; gifted to private collection, New York.Kenny Burgess's Untitled (Male Nude) is inspired by a scene from As Is a play by William M. Hoffman. Directed by Marshall W. Mason and co-produced by The Circle Repertory Company and The Glines production company. The show opened on March 10, 1985, at the Circle Theatre, where it ran for 49 performances. The cast included Jonathan Hadary, Jonathan Hogan, Lou Liberatore, Ken Kliban and Claris Erickson. As Is portrays the effect that HIV, a relatively new epidemic in the 1980s, has on a group of friends living in New York City. The scene Kenny Burgess portrays is of a nude reclining sex worker.This play depicts a gay couple, Saul and Rich, who open the play with their relationship separation. Rich's decision to separate is reversed when he returns to Saul after contracting AIDS from his new lover. Seeking emotional support, Rich shows how people with AIDS were treated by the American family, doctors and friends. Their impersonal and detached attitudes lead Rich to recognize the importance of a partner for the gay individual."
