DESCRIPT: KENNY BURGESS  (1935-1989)
CROSSHEAD: Untitled (Male Nude).
TYPESET: '<p>Colored inks on cream wove paper. 279x355 mm; 10â…žx14 inches. Signed in
  ink, lower right. Provenance: Gifted from the playwright William Hoffman to producer
  John Glines; gifted to private collection, New York. Kenny Burgess''s <em>Untitled
  (Male Nude)</em> is referred to in the script of <em>As Is</em>, a play by William
  M. Hoffman. Directed by Marshall W. Mason and co-produced by The Circle Repertory
  Company and The Glines production company. The show opened on March 10, 1985, at
  the Circle Theatre, where it ran for 49 performances. The cast included Jonathan
  Hadary, Jonathan Hogan, Lou Liberatore, Ken Kliban and Claris Erickson. As Is portrays
  the effect that HIV, a relatively new epidemic in the 1980s, has on a group of friends
  living in New York City. The scene Kenny Burgess portrays is of a nude reclining
  sex worker. This play depicts a gay couple, Saul and Rich, who open the play with
  their relationship separation. Rich''s decision to separate is reversed when he
  returns to Saul after contracting AIDS from his new lover. Seeking emotional support,
  Rich shows how people with AIDS were treated by the American family, doctors and
  friends. Their impersonal and detached attitudes lead Rich to recognize the importance
  of a partner for the gay individual. Kenny Burgess designed the posters for the
  early plays of Cafe Cino, the West Village home of the Off-Broadway movement. Robert
  Patrick, William Hoffman, and Lanford Wilson are some of the successes from Cafe
  Cino. Burgess hid clues in the posters tipping off "in the know" audience members
  about the performances at Cafe Cino without alerting the NYC Police Department since
  Cafe Cino wasn''t licensed for live performances. He was the dish-washer at Cafe
  Cino and created the posters and artwork on the side. Many of his works are in the
  permanent collection at the New York Public Library, Billy Rose Theatre Collection.</p>'
