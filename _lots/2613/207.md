FOOTNOTE: "\"Arthur told me the story, I asked him to write it out, he gave me I think a typed unsigned page close writ on his idiosyncratic typewriter. I reproduced it in Straight Heart's Delight (Gay Sunshine) exactly as writ. But can't find his paper now, among 200,000 indexed items at Columbia U. Library special collections. Whitman scholar Miller asked for Arthur's original letter 10 years ago, I searched then, no luck. I suppose it'll turn up, hope so.\"From the collection of Jonathan Ned Katz."
