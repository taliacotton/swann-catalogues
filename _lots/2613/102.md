at-a-glance: ''
FOOTNOTE: '"The Queen" also featured Crystal LaBeija, who makes it the final round
  of the competition, and accuses the Flawless Sabrina of favoring the white contestants.
  Prior to the competition, LaBeija was one only a few African American drag queens
  to be awarded a "Queen of the Ball" title at a drag ball, and, deciding not to continue
  participating in a disciminatory system, she worked with another Black drag queen,
  Lottie LaBeija, to host a ball for Black queens. Their first event was the first
  to be hosted by a House, for which the term was coined. Cyrstal LaBeija would become
  the founder of the House of LaBeija and had a foundational role in the formation
  of "Houses" and underground ball culture.'
