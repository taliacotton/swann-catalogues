  sketches, four on a single sheet, include pink triangles on light blue, light green
  and black backgrounds along with two proposed text placements. "Silence is Death"
  was Johnston''s original contribution to the Collective''s search for an effective
  tagline for the poster (After Silence, p. 45), and during the design process "Oliver
  kept pushing for versions with brightly colored backgrounds" (ibid p. 47). </p><p>These
  recently re-discovered sketches were left in the home of Silence=Death collective
  member, Jorge Socarras, after the final 1986 Silence=Death collective meeting at
  which Johnston drew them. They shed light on a pivotal moment of the visionary design
  process involved in originating the Silence=Death logo.</p><p>Oliver Johnston was
  one of the original 6 members of the Silence=Death Collective. He was a graduate
  of Parsons and a graphic designer in his own right. He was the only member of the
  collective not to survive the AIDS era, he passed away from AIDS complications in
  1990.</p><p>with- Adhesive Silence=Death sticker in yellow and pink, issued in memoriam
