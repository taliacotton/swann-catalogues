Signed, Barry Bridgewood, dated, 2015, and inscribed as titled on verso. Barry Bridgwood attended The Art Institute of Boston from 1978-81 and the School of Visual Arts, NY from 1981-83. He emerged from school just as the short-lived art scene of Manhattan's East Village was in its boon. This was a vibrant time with youth culture vying for attention in the galleries, clubs and graffiti decorated walls of the city. Though much of the art in New York during the 1980s was socially charged realism, Bridgwood chose abstraction as his means of expression."
