  on masonite, 2015. Signed, Barry Bridgewood, dated, 2015, and inscribed as titled
  on verso. 425x368 mm; 16 3/4 x14 1/2 inches. </p><p>Barry Bridgwood attended The
  Art Institute of Boston from 1978-81 and the School of Visual Arts, NY from 1981-83.
  He emerged from school just as the short-lived art scene of Manhattan's East Village
  was in its boon. This was a vibrant time with youth culture vying for attention
  in the galleries, clubs and graffiti decorated walls of the city. Though much of
  the art in New York during the 1980s was socially charged realism, Bridgwood chose
  abstraction as his means of expression.</p>"
