Inspired by an earlier photo exhibition, this documentary presented inspirational stories of a cross section of Americans living with AIDS. It shows that life doesn't end with a positive test result.  \"A gay men's swim team provides a particularly potent image of health and vitality that seems entirely at odds with images of deformity, sickness, debilitation, and misery we associate with AIDS\" (tvguide.com)."
