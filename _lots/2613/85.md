FOOTNOTE: "Angus McBean was known as a mask maker and set designer before turning to theatrical photography full time. Innovative and prolific, his style became hugely influential, particularly as a celebrity portrait photographer. McBean was arrested in 1944 on charges of homosexuality and was imprisoned for two years. Nevertheless, after the war, McBean successfully resumed his career. His photograph of the Fab Four served as the cover of The Beatles' first album Please Please Me.\n\nToday McBean is also considered a cult figure associated with surrealism. In addition to his \"surrealized\" portraits of actresses such as Audrey Hepburn and Vivien Leigh, McBean created inventive tableuax that featured elaborate miniatures he designed and construced himself, spending weeks to achieve the desired effect. These images often served as McBean's Christmas cards, but this large, gorgeously hand-colored silver print is an usual and exceedingly rare oversized example of this work. In it, a nude male figure emerges from the sand under a dreamy pastel sky. In the background, a mysterious figure in gold underneath a tattered sail beckons."
