FOOTNOTE: "\"Your daughter has certainly inherited her mother's good looks, if she has half her mother's brains she should have a brilliant future in store for her. I will with pleasure do anything I can to help her, but your own influence is very great I need not say.\"At present, there is a provincial company doing Lady Windermere's Fan--if there should occur a vacancy, would she care, or you care for her to go with it? The part would be quite a small one, of course.\"Thanks for y'r wishes for my new play--I have settled nothing yet--but think of letting the Haymarket have it.\""
