  known for his peculiar homo-fetish art, much of which involves male bare feet, featured
  prominently in this drawing. His early cartoon work about the fictional company
  "Dumbrella" became a jumping-off point to the broader genre of underground erotic
  drawings and comics. An ambitious self-promoter, by his mid-20s, he developed his
  pseudonym of Palanca (which means "lever" or "gear shift"), moved to Los Angeles,
  and made connections in the erotic and gay art circles there, most notably through
  the Tom of Finland Foundation, who honored him with a Tom''s Award in 2007. </p><p>Palanca''s
  drawings have been published in European and American magazines including <em>FootScene,
  Sneerzine, Honcho,</em> and <em>Inches.</em></p><p>Provenance: Tom of Finland Foundation;
