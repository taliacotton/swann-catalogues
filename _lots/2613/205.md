FOOTNOTE: '"I am pleased that my essay from 1944 might be included in excerpt in your
  new edition of Gay American History. Was that essay in Politics the first public
  avowal of an author''s homosexuality? At the time, I knew of no other, and felt
  the obvious should be done."My view still remains . . . it is our humanity that
  is most difficult to remain true to. To affirm our commonality."That is the deep
  significant possibility I see in all Gay Liberation--. . . that there is a recognition
  that the entire range of sexual natures and of love relationships is essential to
  the strength and reality of the commonweal. . . ."From the collection of Jonathan
  Ned Katz.'
