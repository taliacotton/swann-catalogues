His works are owned by private collectors and museums including The Mount, Edith Wharton's home. Art critic James Cooper wrote in 2012: \"Howard's sculptures have content as well as exquisite form\". He is currently sculpting the National WWI Memorial, a 60 foot long bronze relief to be installed in Pershing Park, Washington D.C. In his studio, Apollo, Hermes, Aphrodite, and others all demonstrate the journey we trace from being fragmented to becoming complete. Howardâ€™s aesthetic is focused on timeless appeal and harmony."
