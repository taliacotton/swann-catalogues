  a lined, folded notebook sheet with a notary seal on cover and occasional fabric
  swatches for the realized costumes; contents hold Anderson''s costume drawings in
  watercolor, ink, and wash, the versos contain notations and signatures used in English
  legal court proceedings over the dispute between Anderson and Kassa''s playwright,
  John Luther Long (see note). Average measurement of drawings is 254x180 mm; 10x7¼
  inches; nearly all bear Anderson''s monogram. Lined notebook sheets measure 12¾x8
  inches. Presumed to be complete.</p><p>A fascinating archive of costume designs
  for a grand-scale, early 20th century stage production. Kassa was an Edwardian-era
  dramatization of the story of "the broken butterfly" from the ancient Hunnish book.
  Its author, John Luther Long, was a collaborator of the great theatrical producer
  and playwright David Belasco, who first adapted Long''s short story "Madame Butterfly"
  to the stage before Puccini adopted the libretto for what became his most famous
  opera. Kassa''s leading lady was Mrs. Leslie Carter, among the greatest actresses
  of her generation, nicknamed "The American Sarah Bernhardt." The play premiered
  at the New National Theatre in Washington, D. C. on January 4, 1909 before traveling
  north to Broadway''s Liberty Theatre for a short but well-attended run. </p><p>Anderson
  was a prolific and successful English stage designer of opera and musical comedies,
  best known for his long tenures with the Savoy Operas, D''Oyly Carte Opera Company,
  and His Majesty''s Theatre. Although focused on musical theatre professionally,
  socially Anderson also enjoyed the company of writers, artists and politicians,
  including Hamilton Aidé, Lord Ronald Gower and Hugh Walpole with whom he was closely
  associated. While Anderson''s work was more rooted in 19th-century tradition, his
  work can be seen as an important forerunner of the more famous Avant-Garde stage
  designers Leon Bakst, Claude Lovat Fraser, and Edward Gordon Craig. Kassa''s massive
  eighty-five member cast kept Anderson busy and the sheer number of designs in this
  archive display his dedication to the stylistic details demanded of the scenes and
  storyline. The attention to color, fabrics and finishes, historical style, accessories,
  and harmony of group attire are exquisite, each drawing enriched with his copious
  notes.</p><p>Due to a disagreement regarding payment and use of the designs, legal
  action was brought by Anderson against Long for non-payment of these designs. The
  archive contains a few documents relating to this case including: a series of seven
  Typed Letters Signed by Long in 1908 from Philadelphia, relating to the staging
  and production of Kassa, and stating that Mrs. Leslie Carter was responsible for
  payment to Anderson for the costumes, a Manuscript Letter Signed by Anderson to
  Carter, 1909, and the original mailing envelope with same notary seals as the folders,
  containing those contents, sent by Henry F. Walton, Esq. to the Court of Common
  Please in Philadelphia, stamped September 16, 1912.</p>'
