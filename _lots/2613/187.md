at-a-glance: ''
FOOTNOTE: 'The accompanying exhibition catalogue reads as follows: "The work is the
  first "PUNK" treatment of any of the existing object lines from the series ''My
  Latin Heritage.'' The ''My Latin Heritage'' series is a personal historical myth
  construction of the artist''s real and imaginary past. Here, the artist is seen
  in the bottom photo coupled with his regular photographer''s image seen above in
  portrait. An indication of the master/slave relationship: photographer to subject.
  Who''s on top? The graffiti advertises the FALN, a terrorist, Puerto-Rican liberation
  group; also it titles the top photograph of the artists'' photographer Jimmy DeSana,
  as El Cansearch Presidente. Cansearch, is a cancer research institute, founded by
  the artist, and the art objects, such as this one , and his films, videotapes, etc,
  is the actual research itself, in the direction of understanding cancer. The piece
  should have an urgency to it: a quick, easy blow up of a not-posed-looking mug shot
  situation; a rushing to Press: to sell the FALN story: a believable sympathy/identification
  with FALN and art/terrorism. Finally, the piece is a direct outgrowth of my involvement
  with the ESOTERRORISTS, a street gang (Anya Phillips, Duncan Smith & myself): we
  support the notion of PUNK JUNK ROCK CANCER SEND. Our target is: CORP. CANCER RECEIVE."
