DESCRIPT: SAMUEL STEWART (1909-1993)
CROSSHEAD: Untitled.
TYPESET: '<p>Watercolor and ink on wove paper, 241x374 mm; 9½x14¾inches.</p><p>Provenance:
  estate of the artist; acquired by the Johnny Cakes Books, Salisbury, Connecticut;
  purchased from above, 2014 by current owner, private collection, New York.</p><p>Raised
  in a Protestant household fearing sexuality, Samuel Stewart quickly realized he
  was attracted to other boys. Stewart attended Ohio State University and graduated
  with a Ph.D. in English in the early 1930s. He taught at Ohio State during his last
  year there and, after graduation, moved around to teaching positions at Carroll
  College in Montana, Washington State University, and Loyola University in Chicago.
  He arrived at Loyola in 1937, but left academia believing it didn''t afford him
  enough time for writing or his other passion, tattooing. He used the moniker Phil
  Sparrow in the early 1960s as a tattoo artist on Chicago''s notorious South State
  Street. Steward worked closely with Alfred Kinsey on his landmark sex research.
  In 1964, he took his tattooing skills to California when he relocated to the East
  Bay Area. He was the tattoo artist of the Hells Angels Motorcycle club. Stewart
  became an intimate friend of Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, and Thornton Wilder
  while maintaining a secret sex life from childhood on and documented these experiences
  in brilliantly vivid (and often very funny) detail.</p><p>Using the aliases Ward
  States, John McAndrews, and Donald Bishop, he was a prolific essayist in the first
  European gay magazines; as Phil Andros, he was the author of a series of popular
  pornographic gay novels during the 1960s and 1970s. He used drugs throughout his
  life and became addicted to barbiturates at the end of his life. He also struggled
  with his psychological health, suffering "through long periods of dark depression,
  loneliness and self-destructive behavior."</p>'
