  Jersey.William H. Littlefield spent his childhood at his mother's riding stable
  and attended Harvard in 1921, receiving an A.B. in 1924. The son of Samuel Horace
  Littlefield, a Harvard-educated medical doctor, he was known for his strength in
  drawing but did not practice fine art at university. He studied privately under
  Adeleine Wolever, Charles Woodbury, and Edmund Tarbell. In 1925 he met Nicholas
  Podiapolski, his future lover and muse that inspired his early practice. Littlefield
  became acquainted with Lincoln Kirstein and his circle in New England. In October
  of 1934, at Kirstein's request, Littlefield created the stage sets for <em>Serenade
  </em>and <em>Mozartiana,</em> the American Ballet of New York's first production,
  performed at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford.After the passing of his parents,
  he devoted himself to art criticism, painting, and arts administration in Provincetown
  and became a fixture in the local arts community, turning to abstractionism and
  set design until his death in 1969. Significant exhibitions include <em>William
