He worked from photographs, first shooting his models then creating fully formed compositions based on these images. Often they depict his friends and acquaintances, he even photographed himself as a model.  In addition to his artwork, he worked as a curator for many years before dedicating himself to his studio practice. He stated: \"The development of my art has paralleled my homoerotic exploration and as I discovered aspects of the gay world, I incorporated them into my paintings and drawings. My translation of the gay world to imagery, to art, defined what I was learning to myself, and each – art and lifestyle – became a part of the other.\""
