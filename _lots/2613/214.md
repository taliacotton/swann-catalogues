  Farm was a men''s summer camp located about 60 miles southwest of Ottawa in rural
  Ontario, Canada. They boasted of a staff of cabin boys, pool attendants, and massuers
  "hand picked from amongst the best physique stars and finest physique models." The
  brochure is illustrated with photographs of volleyball players and swimmers which
  emphasize the point. </p><p>While we have found no press coverage of Winterset Farm,
  they did run frequent help-wanted ads in the Ottawa Citizen from 1966 to 1969, seeking
  masseurs, musclemen, and bodybuilders. We trace no other Winterset material in OCLC
  or at auction, but the ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives at the University
  of Southern California does hold a folder of their marketing materials.</p>'
