FOOTNOTE: "Gifted by the artist to Robert A. Stefanotti, his gallerist, in 1974. DeSana moved to New York in 1973 and gifted several copies of this portfolio to friends and acquaintances who helped him get established in the city. \n\nThe grainy, flash-lit images in this portfolio, partially influenced by 1950s pornography, depict DeSana's friends and acquaintances posing nude in various domestic and suburban settings. Far from confrontational (indeed \"without eroticism,\" as DeSana himself noted), the nudity here is organized around an examination of conformity, consumerism, sexual liberation, and queer identity. Printed himself on a small press (the images could not be commercially printed, given the subject matter), the images also recall the influence of Surrealism on the photographer.\n\nDeSana was a part of the counterculture \"punk\" community of artists and musicians living in Manhattan's East Village in the 1970s and 80s. His work is both personal and subversive, and his voice and perspective as complex and revolutionary today as it was then."
