  Urvashi Vaid (October 1958 - May 2022) was an Indian-born American LGBTQ+ rights activist, lawyer, and writer. She was the author of two books and held a series of roles at the National LGBTQ Task Force, including leading the organization (then called the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force) during the height of the AIDS crisis. Many years before intersectionality became a common approach to activism, she insisted that freedom for gay men and lesbians meant fighting for gender, racial, and economic equality as well. She also argued against fighting for access to the mainstream, instead fighting for power to change and alter it, a progressive position that was completely unique. “My understanding of liberation did not come from the feminist and gay activists with whom I worked, but rather from movements working to end colonial occupation and white supremacy,” she wrote on the website OpenDemocracy in 2014.

  Sue Hyde was the co-founder and, for 30 years, the Director of NGLTF’s Creating Change Conference. She is currently Executive Director and Board Secretary of the Wild Geese Foundation.
