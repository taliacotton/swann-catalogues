Signed, numbered, and dated by Rapp \"90/100 / Bruce Rapp `86\" in pencil, lower margin; additionally signed in the plate. In addition to being used to advertise one of his own early exhibitions, Rapp's \"Boot\" was recently featured as part of the collection and appeared on the cover of the exhibition catalogue for All Together: A Group Exhibition from the collection of Tom of Finland Foundation. The show ran simultaneously in Venice and Paris from May through June, 2022. Rapp's artistic talent in several media led him to produce work for Drummer magazine, safe-sex-themed posters, and various commissioned works. He created a comic book in Spanish called Chicos Modernos, a comic book novella that featured young Latinos confronting HIV and AIDS. Before the disease claimed him in 1990, Rapp enjoyed a successful career; his work was supported by Tom of Finland, who encouraged his talent in depicting the gay leather genre."
