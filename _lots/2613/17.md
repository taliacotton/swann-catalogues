DESCRIPT: OTHO CUSHING (1871-1942)
CROSSHEAD: '"The Song of Higher Arthur."'
TYPESET: <p>Illustration to accompany Cushing's poem of the same name, published in
  Life Magazine, Volume 58, page 1092, 1911. Pen and ink on illustration board. 520x695
  mm; 20½x27½ inches. Signed "Otho Cushing" lower left image. Poem typed on small
  strip of partially cropped paper, mounted to upper right corner of verso.</p><p>Though
  an accomplished illustrator, cartoonist, and poster artist who studied and taught
  in the U.S. and abroad, there exists little biographical coverage of Cushing, much
  as a result of his heirs destroying evidence of his sexuality. Most prolific at
  the turn of the century when commercial illustration hit its stride in magazines
  and newspapers, he was influenced by his contemporaries J.C. Leyendecker, Aubrey
  Beardsley and his admittedly favorite illustrator, Lord Frederic Leighton. Art historians
  have remarked that across his body of work, a clear homoeroticism can be detected
  in the proportions and the haughty attitude of his young male subjects, evidenced
  here by the dance's onlookers.</p>
