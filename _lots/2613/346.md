FOOTNOTE: "Shelby Sharie Cohen has been a photographer in the San Francisco Bay Area for close to 40 years. Her recently discovered photographic archive offers a rare look at San Francisco's lesbian, BDSM, erotic, and queer communities during the Feminist Sex Wars and the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and 1990s. The Archive is represented by Bolerium Books in San Francisco and contains over 10,500 negatives and slides and more than 700 prints. These photographs, many of which were taken for the groundbreaking sex-positive magazine On Our Backs, document San Francisco's lesbian leather community and the rise of sex clubs during the Feminist Sex Wars, as well as the city's wider queer community as reflected in Theatre Rhinoceros, AIDS fundraisers, the Gay Games, gay weddings, music festivals, and political activism. Cohen currently lives in Northern California and focuses on portrait photography."
