FOOTNOTE: '21 May 1982 [from postmark]: ". . . I think an excellent counter-strategy
  in Academe is to prove that all the known fag writers (precious, marginal) were
  really totally hetero--Emphasize the uxoriousness of Oscar Wilde, father of two;
  show how he was rail-roaded into ''somdomy'' because of his socialism. . . ." 21
  July 1983 [from postmark]: ". . . I thought the Baldwin ''49 piece brilliant; I
  never knew it existed, which explains Jimmy''s nervousness with me at the time--''his
  panic'' is an excellent description of a state of mind which my characters, perhaps,
  shared though the author not. But I was a realist back then--if you succeed in driving
  a stake through those false nouns ''homosexual'' and ''heterosexual,'' statues will
  be built in y''r honor--or perhaps just a large stake to burn you at."2 September
  1988 [from postmark]: ". . . Lucien Price admired Messiah (''54) in the Boston Globe.
  This was a time when I was either not reviewed or strongly attacked. I got to know
  him during the decade (his last) when I could no longer publish novels so turned
  to theater, TV, etc. I read his book on Whitehead with fascination. He was also
  splended to talk to, an old-fashioned Platonist in his questioning style, not in
  his ideas about the state. . . . Anyway, we were as one in our detestation of Christianity
  and the moral mess that accompanies it like an acid rain. . . . True or false, he
  wsa a consistent philosopher, and lived in a glowing nativist past. . . ."4 September
  1989 [from postmark]: "Do you not fear the FBI? Such vileness as you reveal, as
  you life the flat rocks of the republic from the temple floor, may yet cause a hetero
  backlash--It is not enough that you include Abe & Josh in Sodom''s column but Buchanan
  as well . . . ."[11 April 1990]: ". . . In order to demonstrate that heterosexuality
  does not exist, one must first posit the blessed category & by so doing, fall into
  a semantical, sophistical trap. Artful dodging should help you in y''r demolition
  of this great non-sense, so useful to the rulers, and so perfectly evil."18 July
  1996 [from postmark]: ". . . [H]ad you let slip the dogs of ridicule, you would
  have been serious, & in our flat-earth society, solemnity is all-important. One
  can''t be stupid enough for our few dull readers--as for the rest, French horns,
  the triumph of the will, rally courtesy of Mike Eisner. Keep the war going."From
  the collection of Jonathan Ned Katz.'
