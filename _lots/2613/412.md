Signed and dated \"Chelseaboys.com / ©2002 Hanson & Neuwirth\" along right margin. The seventy-ninth strip of the wildly popular syndicated comic that followed the adventures of three gay roommates in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood in the late 1990s-mid 2000s. In this vignette, Sky and his boyfriend Chris express their love for each other after an intimate moment before Sky leaves for a weekend yoga retreat, only to be distracted by the handsome Ché (who was playfully modeled on Ethan Zohn, that year's winner of the TV show \"Survivor: Africa\")."
