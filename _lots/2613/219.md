  Reminder march. '

  said to bear the same text on verso; 4 staple holes with minor rust staining at
  edges, other minor wear and staining consistent with use. Not examined out of modern
  archival frame. [Philadelphia, 1969?]. </p><p>Annual gay rights marches were held
  in front of Philadelphia''s Independence Hall every year on the Fourth of July from
  1965 to 1969. These "Annual Reminder" days were among the first organized gay rights
  protests in the United States, with a focus on equal employment opportunity. The
  1969 march was the largest ever with 150 participants, drawing on the excitement
  of the previous week''s Stonewall Uprising. </p><p>Printed copies of this sign can
  be seen in the hands of picketers at the 1969 Annual Reminder Day in several photographs
  by Nancy Tucker held by the National Constitution Center and in the Barbara Gittings
  Collection at the New York Public Library. Two copies can also be seen in the 2004
  documentary "Gay Pioneers," which also shows Frank Kameny with his collection of
  Annual Reminder Day picket signs (although not this one). Provenance: Gift from
  the pioneering activist Frank Kameny (1925-2011) to the consignor.</p>'
