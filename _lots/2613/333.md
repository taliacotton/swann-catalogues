Conceived in the early 1990s as a \"fuck you\" response to Senator Jesse Helms's stance on banning obsence art from the NEA, Penny Arcade's show has been performed on and off ever since and is considered a \"joyful, sex-positive, queer carnival that asks us to get up from our seats and dance, even as it nurses our political and spiritual wounds.\" (https://www.intomore.com/culture/bitch-dyke-faghag-whore-the-united-states-of-penny-arcade)"
