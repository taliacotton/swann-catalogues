CROSSHEAD: Silence=Death mechanicals for poster.
TYPESET: '<p>Group of 5 paste ups, mechanicals, bluelines, proofs and overlays used
  to create a subsequent printing of the Silence=Death poster, Silence=Death Vote
  poster and typographic layouts in Spanish and French used to create foreign T-shirts
  and buttons bearing the iconic slogan. Sizes vary. Circa 1987-1988.An exceptional
  insight into the creative and technical processes used by the Silence=Death Collective
  in forming and executing their most famous image.</p><p>The font chosen to use by
  the Collective was Gill Sans Serif Ectra Condensed. "It was graphically on-trend
  at the time, but more important, it was chosen for its ability to maximize point
  size within the narrowness of the poster''s topography. The condensed font allowed
  for the increased vertical scale, giving maximum readability from a distance. It
  did, however, have kerning pitfalls. The space between the letters made for a very
  hard read. After the poster hit the streets, a few people asked us why science equals
  death. In the subsequent printing, we opened up the spaces between the I, L and
  E." (After Silence p. 47).</p><p>Provenance: consigned by the Silence=Death Collective.</p>'
