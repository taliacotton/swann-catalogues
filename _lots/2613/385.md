FOOTNOTE: "During the late 1970s, Armstrong became associated with the transgressive \"Boston School\" of photography, which included artists such as Nan Goldin, Mark Morrisroe, and Jack Pierson. Armstrong first received critical attention for his intimate portraits of men, either lovers or friends, whom he captured with an erotic gaze. In the 1990s, he began photographing cityscapes and landscapes in soft focus to contrast with the sharpness of his portraits."
