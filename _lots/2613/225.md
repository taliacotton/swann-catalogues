  Power set out to be bold and provocative. "First of all we must approach the subject
  from within. Whatever examples of gay power have been demonstrated thus far, whether
  it be through straight media or on the part of homosexuals themselves--it''s either
  met with some kind of legal or ignorant interference or too one-sided a picture
  has been presented. Variety is the spice of life and Gay Power is by and for all
  people. A people is what we shall exemplify first not in any ''half see how far
  we can get'' subtle way, but in the best entertaining and educational way"--from
  the mission statement introducing the first issue. Includes activist news and editorials,
  erotic stories and photographs, personal ads, poetry, and more.</p>'
