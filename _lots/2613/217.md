TYPESET: "Rainbow flier, 279x210 mm; 11x8Â¼ inches; minimal wear.  Berkeley, CA,  [April] 1969. More than two months before Stonewall, the Committee for Homosexual Freedom called this April 1969 protest in response to the firing of a gay San Francisco Steamship Lines Company employee. The group also protested the company's role in sending troops to Vietnam, and sought ties with the Black Panthers and the peace movement. In this flier, the attractive psychedelic art by Cooley catches the eye, but it requires a bit of work to see when and where the strike is taking place: \"Picket, Mon thru Fri, 12 till 7, 320 California St.\"--the headquarters of the San Francisco Steamship Lines Company."
