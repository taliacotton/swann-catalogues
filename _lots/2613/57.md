He settled in the Village due to his ideals of integration and a bohemian lifestyle that he saw fit for himself. Delaney painted portraits of friends, supporters, and public figures relevant to him. His social consciousness led him to portray his friends and associated with all racial and sexual backgrounds. He depicted both black and white people, and the hetero-normative and queer residents of the Village. Delaney lived a romantically solitary life as he chose not to express his underlying sexuality due to his strict religious upbringing and the politics of the era."
