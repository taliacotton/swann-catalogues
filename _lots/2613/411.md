TYPESET: "Original 14-panel comic strip, 1998.  Pen and ink with some graphite, on paper.  310x324 mm; 12¼x12½ inches, on 14x14½-inch sheet, mounted to board along verso top edge. Signed and dated \"©1998 Hanson and Neuwirth\" along right margin. The second strip of the wildly popular syndicated comic that followed the adventures of three gay roommates in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood in the late 1990s-mid 2000s. In this vignette, Nathan desperately tries to enjoy a Yankees game on TV in between interviewing a series of potential roommates, one more disappointing than the next, until muscular hunk Sky appears at his door, providing a second \"Grand Slam\" to his day. Chelsea Boys was carried first by Next magazine, and then syndicated throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, and South Africa. Its acclaim led to two book anthologies (Chelsea Boys. Alyson Books, 2003; Chelsea Boys Steppin' Out. Bruno Gmunder, 2006) and an exclusive art show (Chelsea Boys: Hung) at the Leslie-Lohman Museum in October 2003."
