FOOTNOTE: "This multiple was commissioned by the Peter Norton Foundation.\n\nMorimura, who is well-known for transforming himself into Western icons as a critique on gender and culture norms, has here appropriated the iconic Tom Kelley photograph of Marilyn Monroe (1949) that was published in Playboy magazine's very first issue in 1953. The fan as format allows the alluring nude figure to appear and disappear at will, implicating the gaze of the holder."
