  English writer, reformer and lifelong advocate of gay liberation. Disenchanted with
  what he perceived as the hypocrisy of Victorian society, he abandoned his life in
  Cambridge as a scholar and cleric and moved to northern England. Referred to by
  many in recent years as "the gay godfather of the British left," Carpenter''s radical
  politics and open relationship with his partner George Merrill influenced many activists
  and writers, including E.M. Forster, whose visit to the couple in 1913 inspired
  his novel "Maurice."</p>'
at-a-glance: ''
FOOTNOTE: This work on prison reform, prefaced by an excerpt from The Ballad of Reading
  Gaol" is inscribed to a close friend and activist, George Ives. Together with several
  others, they founded the progressive British Society for the Study of Six Psychology,
  which promoted both sexual liberation and education through a rational approach
  to sexual conduct. Ives also independently established the Order of Chaeronea, a
  secret society meant to provide refuge from the prejudices of Victorian society
  and further the cause of gay liberation (among others, Wilde was rumored to be a
  member). The text itself is marked and, in a few places, annotated or corrected
  in ink, most likely by Ives based on the initials "G.I." after one note, but possibly
  by Carpenter as well. Among the work's influences is Clarence Darrow, the American
  lawyer who also wrote extensively on penology and prisons. A French edition was
  published by Schleicher in 1907.
