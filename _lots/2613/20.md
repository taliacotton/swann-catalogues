Circa 1920s.With--A letter written by Jeff Schaire, a former editor-in-chief of Art and Antiques Magazine, describing some context of this work, which was supplied by Barnes to the American Academy of Arts and Letters upon her induction. The Pach Brothers studio was commissioned to create a new portrait of each inducted member, however apparently Barnes insisted on supplying her own image, which was then mounted to a Pach Brothers' board. Both Man Ray and Berenice Abbott photographed Barnes in the 1920s, but this image, featuring a striking high-necked polka dot blouse and hat, is uncredited."
