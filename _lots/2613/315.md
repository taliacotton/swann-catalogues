TYPESET: "Two photo offest posters,  sizes vary. [New York,] Circa 1992.This indelible, 1992 add campaign, which by some accounts increased Calvin Klein sales by 34%, came to an ignominious end in 1993 when Mark Wahlberg was attributed as the source of several homophobic statements. His contract expired in December 1993 and was not renewed. The images appeared in bus shelters and magazines catapulting the young rapper to a new level of stardom and simultaneously creating a fashion sensation and a new aesthetic."
