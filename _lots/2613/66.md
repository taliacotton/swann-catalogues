  Stephen Tennant cultivated a life of glamour if accomplishing little professionally
  during his life. As one of the most colorful members of London's "Bright Young Things,"
  the group of Bohemian socialites in the 1920s, he stood out for his flamboyance,
  beauty, and wit, among his more productive companions who included Harold Acton,
  Cecil Beaton, Evelyn Waugh, the Mitfords and the Sitwells, though he did inspire
  numerous characters in their novels. His own literary and artistic ambitions were
  fostered by such illustrious friends as Willa Cather, E.M. Forster, the Bloomsbury
  Group members, and Siegfried Sassoon, with whom he had a romantic relationship.
  </p><p>The majority of his surviving - and now coveted - writing and artwork was
  centered around his novel "Lascar," which remained unfinished at his death, despite
  several decades devoted to its creation. Some of the drawings for Lascar have come
  on the market and the ones offered here, which bear a strong resemblance to those,
  may also have been intended for the book.</p>
