TYPESET: "Screenprint. 445x597mm; 17½x23½. Circa 1975.A prominent fashion designer and illustrator, Volbracht was arguably most recognized for the two shopping bags he designed for Bloomingdale's in the 1970s (ironically he neglected to use the store's name on his design, and yet the images became advertising icons all the same). One of the bags featured a portrait of a woman on one side, and this portrait of a man on the oppposite side. Although never specifically identified it is believed the portrait is of Robert Yoh, a Zoli model."
