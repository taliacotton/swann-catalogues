  P. Verlaine."</p><p>Mes Prisons is an account of the various prisons endured by
  the great poet, beginning with the school "dungeon" where he was sent as a child
  for an incorrect Latin conjugation through several incarcerations for disturbing
  the peace as an adult. Most of this book is concerned with his two-year sentence
  to Mons prison (of which he served 18 months) for the murder of Arthur Rimbaud,
  his lover, in Brussels, on July 12, 1873. Verlaine discusses the shooting and the
  trial, his life in prison afterwards and the various psychic prisons he has since
  occupied.</p><p>Picard (1836-1924) was Verlaine''s lawyer in the Rimbaud affair
  and one of the poet''s closest friends. Also a distinguished journalist, playwright
  and patron of the arts, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in literature five
  times. A lecture Verlaine delivered on his prison experiences in Picard''s home
  was the basis of Mes Prisons. This lecture was arranged by Octave Maus, a Belgian
  art critic, writer and lawyer. His invitation to Verlaine asked for a presentation
  that would "have a little bearing on the law.... [I]t might be interesting to hear
  your account of your judicial dealings in Belgium.... My Prisons by Paul Verlaine-what
  an alluring title for a lecture" (cited in Richardson). This presentation was a
  notable event. According to Petitfils, it was attended by all of Belgium''s most
  important writers. Richardson, Verlaine 303. Petitfils, Verlaine 398-403.</p>'
