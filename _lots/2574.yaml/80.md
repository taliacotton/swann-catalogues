TYPESET: "Illustration for the cover of <i>Der Spiegel,</i> issue #50,  1999.  Oil on wood panel. 15¾x13¼ inches, 400x340 mm. Signed \"© Braldt Bralds,\" lower right. Archivally float-mounted in archival matte and silver metal frame measuring 28½x25 inches. <br><br>In 2004 this portrait of Einstein became the signature image used in all the publicity for <i>Der Spiegel's</i> traveling exhibition titled “Die Kunst des Spiegel” (The Art of Der Spiegel). The two-year tour celebrating the magazine’s cover art spanning fifty years began in Hamburg, Germany, visited major cities in Europe and Asia, and had its final showing at New York’s Society of Illustrators. <br><br>Bralds, a mostly self-taught artist from the Netherlands, has been a prolific and sought-after illustrator for several decades. He was launched into fame beginning in 1978 when he received his first commission with a cover for <i>TIME</i> magazine soon followed by his indelible image of the proud Morgaine on horseback gracing the cover of <i>The Mists of Avalon,</i> Marion Zimmer Bradley's 1983 women-focused historical fiction bestseller about Arthurian legends. Bralds' impressive client list includes such notable publications as <i>Newsweek, Omni Magazine, The Washington Post, Rolling Stone, Atlantic Monthly, Esquire, Playboy, Penthouse, National Geographic,</i> and more. His work has been featured in ad campaigns for Alfa Romeo, Atlantic Records, Grand Marnier, Gucci, IBM International, Kahlua, Levi-Strauss, Pirelli Brazil, among others. <br>He has designed three stamp issues for the United Nations Postal Service and the United States Postal Service. In the late 1990s, Bralds transitioned to a fine art career, displaying his work in exhibits and galleries throughout the world. <br> A long list of awards includes a Hall of Fame recognition from the Dutch Society of Illustrators, an Andy Award, and a Clio Award. From The Society of Illustrators, he has won several medals, the coveted Hamilton King Award in 1984 and, just this spring of 2021, was inducted into their prestigious Hall of Fame."
