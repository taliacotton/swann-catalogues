DESCRIPT: "EDWARD GOREY (1925-2000)"
CROSSHEAD: "Amphigorey: A Musicale. Three proscenium designs."
year: "1992"
TYPESET: "Three separate designs used in the various stage productions of <i>Amphigorey,</i> circa 1992-2000. Pen, ink, and correction fluid on paper. The most elaborate, measuring 280x330 mm; 11x13 inches, contains dragons entangled around heavily black-leafed vines spelling out \"Q.R.V.\"  Signed \"Edward Gorey\" in pencil, lower right, and with his measurements inked around the margins.  Float-mounted and archivally matted and archivally framed.<br>The other two, titled \"First Portal\" and \"Second Portal\" are simpler vining leaves measuring slightly smaller at 253x293 mm; 10x11Â½ inches each. Both signed and notated as dragon design.<br><br>These illustrations, based upon Gorey's work about the mysterious tonic Q.R.V., were reproduced as large, 8-foot panels that flanked the sides of the stage for various scenes. Shortly before his death, Gorey sold the artwork he had created for the 1992 Philadelphia Plays and Players Theatre production of Amphigorey, A Musicale to help raise funds for the 2000 production of The Gorey Details, the third and final incarnation of the play that began as Tinned Lettuce; or, the New Musical before it was reworked as Amphigorey, A Musicale and finally to The Gorey Details. This last incarnation of the play was in progress when he died and was produced posthumously."
