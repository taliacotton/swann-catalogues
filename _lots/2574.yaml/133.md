CROSSHEAD: "\"The Earth's Adoration.\""
year: "1911"
TYPESET: "Illustration for unknown publication. Pen, ink, and gouache on paper. 224x146 mm; 8¾x5¾ inches, on 12x9-inch sheet. Signed \"Petrezselyem M. Petersham\" in lower left image; possibly dated \"1911[?]\" and signed \"Petrezselyem\" again, in lower margin. Hinged to window matte; framed. <br><br>A beautiful, detailed drawing and among the earliest that we could locate signed with his Hungarian birth name. <br><br>Maud and Mishka Petersham were groundbreaking illustrators and publishers during the golden age of children's book publishing in America, producing over 100 books in a span of over five decades. This detailed drawing, very much in the manner of Harry Clarke and his fellow Hungarian and friend, the illustrator Willy Pogany, may have been done while he was a student at Budapest's Royal National School for Applied Arts or perhaps soon after his arrival in New York in 1912."
