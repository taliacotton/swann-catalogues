Rennert, The Poster Art of Tomi Ungerer, 13. <br><br>Ungerer was asked to create a series of anti-war posters in 1967 by staff and students of Columbia University, but the bureaucratic and logistical frustration of producing him forced him to walk away. With the aid of his friend, Richard Kasak, he privately printed as many posters from the sketches as as time and money would allow, including \"Prestige\" which was among the best known. They received worldwide distrubtion and attention, spreading his anti-Vietnam sentiments in a visceral and humanistic way."
