FOOTNOTE: "James Conway Farley (1855-after 1910) of Richmond, VA is regarded as \"the first prominent Black photographer in the United States\" (Encyclopedia of African American Business, page 296). After many years at other studios, he opened his own Jefferson Fine Art Studio in 1895 or 1896. According to the Richmond directories and newspapers, the Jefferson studio was at 523 East Broad Street through 1906. Farley worked at 627 East Broad in 1907 and 1908. He appeared as a photographer in Jersey City, NJ in the 1910 census before disappearing from the historical record. <br><br><br><br>None of these photographs is fully identified, though one of the portraits has a pencil inscription on verso: \"From Annabel to Fannie.\" We trace no other examples of Farley's work at auction."
