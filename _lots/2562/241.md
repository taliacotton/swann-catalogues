FOOTNOTE: "A pamphlet announcing the national annual celebration of Negro History Week beginning on 7 February 1932. It includes a lengthy bibliography of suggested readings, and an extended essay on the failure of the educational system to teach this history. On page 12, the 1932 bicentennial of George Washington's birth is discussed. The release of this pamphlet, and its discussion of the Washington bicentennial, are discussed in the New York Age of 12 December 1931. Versions of this pamphlet were issued annually from the first celebration in 1926, with variations in length and starting dates slightly altered to reflect a Sunday launch. This one advertises \"the second week in February beginning the 7th,\" which coincides with 1932. At 16 pages, it is much longer than the 1926 and 1927 editions."
