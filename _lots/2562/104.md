CROSSHEAD: "Pair of sample petitions to put community control of police on the ballot in Oakland and Berkeley."
TYPESET: "Each [6] pages, 14 x 8Â½ inches, staple-bound; minor foxing and wear."
at-a-glance: "Oakland and Berkeley, CA, circa 1969"
FOOTNOTE: "These two sample petitions detail a radical proposal to divide the police departments of Oakland and Berkeley into White and Black precincts, requiring officers of each to live in the precincts they serve, administered by elected neighborhood commissions. Each has a map showing the proposed boundaries, the full legal text of the proposed resolution, and 2 pages of blank petition forms. The completed petitions were to be returned to the National Committees to Combat Fascism, care of each city's local Black Panther Party office. Each was marked prior to Xeroxing: \"Example only, for other cities in America. All N.C.C.F. members, study thoroughly for decentralization of police.\" <br><br><br><br>Newspaper reports show that more than 15,000 signatures were collected on these petitions before October 1970, and that the Berkeley resolution made it to the 7 April 1971 municipal election ballot as Proposition One, where it was soundly defeated."
