FOOTNOTE: "Jeremiah Gunderway (1787-1875) spent his life in and near the Massachusetts coastal town of Scituate, south of Boston. He was a well-known river pilot, steering the town's distinctive gundalows full of salt hay to farms along the shore. He is discussed at length in Briggs's 1887 history of the town, \"History of Shipbuilding on North River,\" page 59, where this portrait is reproduced on the facing page. Among his accomplishments, Gunderway beat alcoholism, going without a drink for the last 40 years of his life, although he replaced that addiction with a raisin habit that sometimes exceeded half a pound a day."
