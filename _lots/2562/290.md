FOOTNOTE: "Ola A. Mayo (born 1918) was raised as one of 12 children in rural Moneta, VA, and by 1940 had moved to Washington, DC to work as a domestic. In 1941 she married Sheppard A. Brandon (1919-1977), who joined the army the following year. Sheppard appears just a couple of times, as a civilian. Several other relatives in uniform do appear, including brothers William, Edward, and Samuel Mayo, and brother-in-law Sergeant Willie F. Brandon. Ola also seems to have found new work during the war. One snapshot shows her standing in front of a school bus, captioned \"I am the driver.\" A small percentage of the photographs are post-war."
