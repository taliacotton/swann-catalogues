FOOTNOTE: "In April and May 1963, Martin Luther King led a major campaign to draw attention to Birmingham, Alabama, then known as the most segregated city in America. During this campaign, King was arrested and wrote his famous Letter from Birmingham Jail. Two weeks after his release, local students filled the downtown streets for another protest, which Sheriff Bull Connor dispersed with attack dogs and high-powered water cannons. Associated Press photographer Bill Hudson took this shot (the most famous image of his long career) of a German Shepherd lunging at student Walter Gadsden, which appeared on the front page of the next day's New York Times."
