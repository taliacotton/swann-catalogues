The circular is illustrated with the Danny Lyon photograph of 22-year-old John Lewis and other protesters kneeling in prayer at a segregated swimming pool in Cairo, IL in July 1962, as also seen in the poster \"Come Let Us Build a New World Together.\" <br><br><br><br>The circular was signed for the consignor by Congressman Lewis at a Martin Luther King commemoration in Kenosha, WI on 26 January 2013.
