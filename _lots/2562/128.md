FOOTNOTE: "The Black Liberation Army was an underground revolutionary organization with close ties and overlapping membership with the Black Panthers, active from at least 1970 to 1981. As described in these police bulletins, \"subjects are followers of Eldridge Cleaver and are . . . dedicated to killing police officers, attacking police stations, and the armed robberies of lending institutions.\" 64 members are listed, of whom 15 had active arrest warrants and 6 were already in custody. Photographs of each (mostly mug shots) follow the lists. Joanne Chesimard (Assata Shakur) is listed as \"wanted\" in the second bulletin; she remains of the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list. Little information regarding the Black Liberation Army has survived. Not only do we not trace any other examples of these bulletins, but the listed names do not appear to be readily available."
