FOOTNOTE: "The first biography written by a Black woman. Susan Paul (1809-1841) came from an activist family. Her father, Thomas Paul was a Baptist minister and an active member of the New England Anti-Slavery Society. She became a teacher and organized the Juvenile Choir of Boston composed of her students, ages 3 to 10, and was moved by the death of one of these little children to write a memoir of his short life. She recounts the \"incidents in the life of a little colored boy\" for a juvenile audience, addressing issues of color and prejudice through stories and parables. Afro-Americana Supplement 1660; not in Blockson. 7 in OCLC, and only one other example traced at auction, a worn example which appeared at a Swann sale, 27 March 2014, lot 109. With--the modern scholarly edition of the Memoir edited by Lois Brown, Harvard University Press, 2000. <br><br><br><br>Helpful tip for book scouts: another unrelated book was published in Boston in 1835 titled \"A Memoir of James Jackson, Jr., M.D., with Extracts from His Letters.\" That one is not worth quite as much."
