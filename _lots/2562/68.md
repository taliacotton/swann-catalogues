FOOTNOTE: 'The Black scientist and surveyor Benjamin Banneker (1731-1806) is best
  known today for the annual almanacs he published from 1791 through 1796. This is
  his scarce second almanac, which was published simultaneously in Philadelphia and
  Baltimore. It begins with a page-length biography of Banneker (it also appeared
  in his 1792 almanac), describing his background and education: "To struggle incessantly
  against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he has learned, however,
  he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome
  life, he availed himself of these." He also describes the astronomical calculations
  he presents in the almanac, which were "finished without the least information or
  assistance from any person . . . so that whatever merit is attached to his present
  performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own." <br><br><br><br>Typical of
  almanacs of this period, it also contains detailed monthly calculations on sunrise,
  sunset, and phases of the moon, as well as predictions on the weather. An engraving
  of "The Anatomy of Man''s Body, as said to be governed by the Twelve Constellations"
  appears on page 3. Other features include a list of feast days, a description of
  the coming eclipses, a table of compound interest, a lengthy court calendar, and
  longer text pieces such as Benjamin Rush''s "A Plan of a Peace-Office, for the United
  States." Several relate to the anti-slavery movement, including "Abstract from the
  Speech of William Pitt on the Motion for the Abolition of the Slave Trade" and "Extract
  from Wilkinson''s Appeal to England on Behalf of the Abused Africans." <br><br><br><br>Banneker
  had famously corresponded with Thomas Jefferson about his almanac in 1791. In this
  issue, he includes a long abstract from Jefferson''s "Notes on Virginia" in opposition
  to slavery, in which Jefferson hopes for "total emancipation . . . with the consent
  of the masters, rather than by their extirpation." Drake, Almanacs 10324; Evans
