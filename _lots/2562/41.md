at-a-glance: "Boston, 14 April 1865"
FOOTNOTE: "A hallmark issue of the great abolitionist weekly newspaper. Of course, the newspaper does not cover the shooting of the president, which took place late that evening. However, it was issued just as the war was coming to a close, with fascinating articles relating to the capture of Richmond and Lee's surrender. With the fall of the Confederacy, William Lloyd Garrison had announced plans for the discontinuation of the Liberator, as his life's work for the past three decades was now largely complete. Perhaps most poignant are the debates over the president's ongoing negotiations for a final peace which he would not live to enjoy."
