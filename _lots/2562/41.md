TYPESET: 4 pages, 25 x 18 inches, on one folding sheet; minor foxing and wear along

at-a-glance: Boston, 14 April 1865
FOOTNOTE: A hallmark issue of the great abolitionist weekly newspaper. Of course,
  the newspaper does not cover the shooting of the president, which took place late
  that evening. However, it was issued just as the war was coming to a close, with
  fascinating articles relating to the capture of Richmond and Lee's surrender. With
  the fall of the Confederacy, William Lloyd Garrison had announced plans for the
  discontinuation of the Liberator, as his life's work for the past three decades
  was now largely complete. Perhaps most poignant are the debates over the president's
  ongoing negotiations for a final peace which he would not live to enjoy.
