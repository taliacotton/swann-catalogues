FOOTNOTE: "The Hyers family were groundbreaking figures who brought Black musical theater to the general public. Singing and acting sisters Anna Madah Hyers and Emma Louise Hyers were managed by their father Samuel B. Hyers. \"Out of Bondage\" was their best-known production, a story of slavery and emancipation with a Black cast--here including the important actor Sam Lucas, in his first major role outside of the minstrel shows where he began his career. The performance advertised here offers an act-by-act synopsis of the plot for Out of Bondage and a full cast list. The play debuted in 1875 or 1876, but we find this cast (particularly Celestine Brown on piano) mentioned in newspapers only from May to November 1877."
