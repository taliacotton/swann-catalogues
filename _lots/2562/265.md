FOOTNOTE: "Author and educator Nellie Rathbone Bright (1898-1977) was best known for her work on the 1920s literary magazine Black Opals (see lot 264). A University of Pennsylvania graduate, she spent 17 years as a principal in the Philadelphia school system. Offered here are a wide-ranging variety of letters addressed to Bright over the course of her career, a few of them referencing her work on Black Opals. Highlights include: <br><br><br><br>Autograph Letter Signed from notable artist Laura Wheeler Waring (1887-1948). Addressed to the members of the Laura Wheeler Art Club at the Durham School where Bright taught, it thanks the students for a Christmas handkerchief. An additional personal note to Bright is inserted. The artist participated in the Harmon Foundationâ€™s first exhibition for African American art later that year. Westchester, PA, 7 January 1927. <br><br><br><br>A pair of Autograph Letters Signed from author Jessie Redmon Fauset Harris (1882-1961), former editor of the Crisis. In the first she writes after a visit to Bright: \"Everything in your home helped me--the lovely house, the fire, the rum, the lunch, and the good talk. I enjoyed those few moments of confidence between us.\" The second describes her pleasant vacation in Atlantic City, NJ: \"I don't imagine the board-walk has its equal anywhere. All along I kept thinking of what a lovely, spontaneous talk we had, and also of those poems. I hope you will finish them up.\" Montclair, NJ, 10 February and 9 July 1948. <br><br><br><br>Letter Signed from composer Alton A. Adams, a native of the Virgin Islands and the first Black bandmaster in the United States Navy. He reflects on the death of Black Lutheran minister Daniel E. Wiseman, and concludes with a discussion of his own work: \"Enclosed you'll find a picture of my band. . . . They are a fine bunch. We have a good band now. My work has been specially commended to the Navy Department by the command here. . . . I will organize and head a Virgin Islands navy band by authority of the Navy Department.\" He encloses a Real Photo postcard of his Virgin Islands Navy Band. Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 7 October 1942. <br><br><br><br>Letter Signed from attorney Raymond Pace Alexander, inviting Bright to a meeting with Carter Woodson to start a Philadelphia chapter of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. Philadelphia, 7 November 1927. <br><br><br><br>Pair of letters signed by James H. Young, Bright's collaborator on Black Opals. About a rival publication, he writes: \"I have seen Lightning . . . but as you say Black Opals undoubtedly will surpass it in every detail, at least I am sure everyone will catch our point of view.\" Germantown, PA, circa 1928. <br><br><br><br>Autograph Letter Signed from Black opera singer Florence Cole-Talbert (1890-1961), a mentor to Marian Anderson: \"I have received Black Opals. . . . I am happy to see the names of new young writers among your contributors. . . . I am to sing with the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra Jan. 28 and it will be broadcasted by KFJ.\" Los Angeles, CA, 7 January 1929. <br><br><br><br>Pair of Autograph Letters Signed by Black artist Frank J. Dillon. In the second he writes \"I have done quite a bit of painting including all branches, which has kept my funds in reasonably good shape. Mount Holly, NJ, 18 March 1929 and 22 November 1942. <br><br><br><br>Autograph Letter Signed by pioneering Black Bermudian golfer Louis Rafael Corbin, mentioning his most famous student: \"Joe Louis will make about $1000 per game while I will get about $750. . . . Will be in Philadelphia for the Negro Nat'l.\" Hamilton, Bermuda, 21 May 1947."
