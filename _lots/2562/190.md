FOOTNOTE: 'This volume bears a gift inscription by the Rev. Jeremiah R.V. Thomas (circa
  1835-after 1880), a significant African Methodist Episcopalian minister in the years
  following the Civil War, in Portsmouth and later in Baltimore and New Orleans. The
  book was given to John Wesley Cromwell (1846-1927), who had been freed from slavery
  as a young boy in 1851, graduated in 1864 from the Institute for Colored Youth in
  Philadelphia, and then in 1865 returned to the town where he had been enslaved,
  Portsmouth, VA, where he opened his own school. During this period, weeks after
  the close of the Civil War, Rev. Thomas inscribed the book "J. Wesley Cromwell,
  presented by Rev. J.R.V. Thomas, Portsmouth, Va., June 8, 1865." The subject, the
  recent history of abolitionist ferment in Kansas, would have likely been of interest
  to the aspiring young political activist and historian. Sabin 27338. '
