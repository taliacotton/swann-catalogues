FOOTNOTE: "This letter filled with family news discusses a former family servant: \"Do you ever hear from old Mammy often? She and sister keep up a regular correspondence. She always mentions Miss Mary. She seems to be quite uneasy about her free papers, lest she might be cheated out of them in some way. She is constantly harping upon them in her letters. She is coming down after Christmas.\" <br><br><br><br>The recipient Mary Allen Buckner Dorsey (1824-1852) married Richard E. Dorsey in Bunker Hill, IL in 1842. Other comments in the letter suggest that it was likely written soon after the birth of her first child Laura in August 1844."
