TYPESET: "23 AP and UPI wire photos, most 8 x 10 inches, one a bit larger and one a bit smaller, with typed captions in negative, and inked subject header and \"Examiner Reference Library\" stamps on verso; 2 cropped with crop marks and related clippings attached, minimal wear to the remainder."
at-a-glance: "Vp, 9 to 23 June 1966"
FOOTNOTE: "The March Against Fear began as a solitary march by James Meredith from Memphis, TN to Jackson, MS. Meredith was shot and wounded by a sniper on the second day of the march on 6 June. These photographs begin 3 days later as thousands of civil rights activists resumed the march in Meredith's name. These photographs focus on the rank and file marchers rather than leaders such as Martin Luther King and Stokely Carmichael, or the celebrity guests who joined them in Jackson. Several images show the police tear gas attack on the marchers' tent encampment in Canton, MS, and one shows demonstrators in Yazoo City with fists raised chanting \"Black power\" against the wishes of Dr. King."
