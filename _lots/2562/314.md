Among the dozens of smaller blurbs are bits on Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, Paul Robeson, Richmond Barthé, Richard Wright, Zora Hurston, and \"Nightclub Map of Harlem\" cartoonist E. Simms Campbell. Closing the issue is a wider-ranging piece titled \"Is There a Negro Society? A Negro Society Girl Writes What She Thinks.\" <br><br><br><br>Billed as \"Volume One, Number Two,\" but no other issues have been traced. It received a glowing review in the California Eagle of 1 December 1938, but the well-connected society editor could not \"for the life of me find anyone who knows when the first number came out.\" She concludes that \"Every Negro ought to own a copy.\" 6 in OCLC (this issue only); none traced at auction."
