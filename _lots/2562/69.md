FOOTNOTE: "An old-fashioned almanac issued by the Mme. C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company, with their large advertisement occupying the centerfold. The monthly tables of moon phases and sunrises include dates of historical significance. Oddly enough, 19 January is noted as Robert E. Lee's birthday, but August commemorates more recent race riots in Harlem and New Jersey. The rest of the volume is devoted to beauty hints, uplifting articles, and copious advertisements. 3 listed in OCLC."
