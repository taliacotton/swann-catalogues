  Chicago suburbs, to his friend Polly in college, enclosing these pamphlets and expressing
  skepticism: "Enclosed is a leaflet I picked up at the conspiracy office. It was
  a last-minute extra to the Chicago Seed. The journalism is bad. Dig the message,
  though. . . . The enclosed leaflet is biased because the Chicago Seed is an underground
  biased newspaper. Let us wait for the investigation by the Justice Department to
  end before we formulate opinions." [Skokie, IL], circa 3 January 1970 (per the postmark
  on the envelope and his "Late Happy New Year" comment).'
