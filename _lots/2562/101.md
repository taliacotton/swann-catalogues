[Chicago], 13 December [1969]. <br><br><br><br>Letter from a young man named Mike from the Chicago suburbs, to his friend Polly in college, enclosing these pamphlets and expressing skepticism: \"Enclosed is a leaflet I picked up at the conspiracy office. It was a last-minute extra to the Chicago Seed. The journalism is bad. Dig the message, though. . . . The enclosed leaflet is biased because the Chicago Seed is an underground biased newspaper. Let us wait for the investigation by the Justice Department to end before we formulate opinions.\" [Skokie, IL], circa 3 January 1970 (per the postmark on the envelope and his \"Late Happy New Year\" comment)."
