at-a-glance: Oakland, CA, 17 February 1968
FOOTNOTE: This poster advertised the first of many Free Huey rallies. It attracted
  a crowd of 5000 to Oakland Auditorium to hear Stokely Carmichael, Bobby Seale, Betty
  Shabazz, Eldridge Cleaver and H. Rap Brown (the latter two not named here). The
  famous portrait of Newton in the fan-backed chair is featured at center. The Oakland
  Tribune story on the rally the next day noted that "a wicker chair in which Newton
  was once photographed for a widely distributed poster was placed empty in the center
  of the stage." No other examples of this poster have been traced in OCLC or at auction.
  <br><br><br><br>The poster was designed by Lisa Lyons, whose work with the Panthers
  also included designing their famous logo. This copy came from her personal files,
  via a Thomaston Place auction, 14 February 2016, to the consignor.
