at-a-glance: 'Hartford, CT: Taylor & Huntington, circa 1890s (printed from a circa
  1864 negative)'
FOOTNOTE: This stereoview depicts 1315 Duke Street in Alexandria, VA, which in 1828
  became Franklin & Armfield, one of the largest slave-trading firms in the United
  States. Many thousands of enslaved people passed through these doors en route from
  Virginia to New Orleans and the booming cotton fields of the deep south. In 1858,
  the business was taken over by "Price, Birch & Co., Dealers in Slaves." James H.
  Birch, one of the partners, was a veteran Washington slave trader who had played
  a central role in the horrific kidnapping of Solomon Northrup (Twelve Years a Slave)
  but was never convicted. The business was evacuated shortly before Union troops
  took possession of Alexandria in 1861. Today the building is home to the Freedom
  House Museum. <br><br><br><br>We don't know who took this iconic photograph of the
  Price, Birch & Co. storefront, but the presence of several Black troops posed in
  front would suggest the closing years of the war. The extensive text on verso states
  that "more than a quarter of a century has passed away" since the conclusion of
  the war.
