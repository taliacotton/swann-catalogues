FOOTNOTE: "Despite the cover, this is not a comic book. The contents are an unusual mix: a personal memoir of the New York breakdancing scene by one of its key members; a serious history of the African and American roots of break-dancing; a photographic manual breaking down the components of key moves; a fashion guide titled \"The B-Boy Look\"; an illustrated \"who's who\" of the scene; a vocabulary list headed \"The B-Boy Glossary\"--and almost incidentally a promotional program to the eight-dancer crew who are profiled on the rear cover. This book has become a cult favorite over the years."
