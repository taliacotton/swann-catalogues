FOOTNOTE: "The Joe Louis Service Guild was a women's club founded in 1942 to support Chicago's Black servicemen, and became a general civic and charity organization after the war. The great boxer's on-again, off-again wife Marva Louis was a founding member, though no longer active in the club by 1946; she is featured on page 4. This program was issued for the club's \"Parade of Stars,\" which featured members and friends portraying famous film stars in scenes from current films: Ruth Toles as Lena Horne, Lloyd Washington as Charlie Chan, and dozens more. Marva Louis made a very special appearance as Marlene Dietrich. Much of the program is devoted to advertisements for Chicago's Black-owned businesses. None in OCLC."
