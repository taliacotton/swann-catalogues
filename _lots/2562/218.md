CROSSHEAD: Diary, photographs, and correspondence of modern dance legend Katherine
  Dunham.
TYPESET: '<p>Approximately 85 items in one box (0.4 linear feet); condition varies,
  moderate dampstaining to diary but generally strong.</p><p>This lot also contains
  43 photographs of Dunham and of her dancers. They include a postcard-sized photo
  signed and inscribed to her mother (illustrated); another signed by Dunham in East
  St. Louis circa 1969-70; a group shot of her with Jean Cocteau and Josephine Baker
  at an opening in Paris, 1950; one with Maurice Chevalier; a still from her film
  Stormy Weather, 1943; with her troupe being greeted off the airplane in Korea, 1956;
  and a 13 x 9-inch Life Magazine print, 1958. Skipping forward several generations
  is a pair of photographs of hip hop artist Wanda Dee, one of them in her touring
  role as Josephine Baker, both signed and inscribed warmly to Dunham as an elder
  role model, circa 2002. </p><p>Among the manuscripts found here are logistical correspondence
  and travel documents from her company’s 1953 tour of Europe; 2 unsigned carbon letters
  from a New York associate suggesting the closure of her dance school, December 1953;
  and a 9 January 1954 carbon of her letter to manager Wilfred Wyler in New York:
  “Could you advise me as to whether an actual lien has been made on the bank accounts?
  It looks as though I will have to stay out of America for some time! Anyway if we
  all keep trying surely something optimistic will happen.” On the business end are
  draft contracts for her performers, 1948 and 1950; “Notes for Investor’s Contract
  between Katherine Dunham, producer and Mr. Nat Goldstone” in 1947; and a draft promotional
  agreement with her manager Mr. Hurok, 1943. 6 cancelled checks are preserved with
  endorsement signatures by Dunham’s “Tropical Revue” dancers James Alexander, Gloria
  Mitchell, Wilbert Bradley, Dolores Harper, and most notably two by Eartha Kitt,
  1945-46; a clipped signature of Langston Hughes dated 8 April 1938 is part of this
  small autograph collection. Also included is a laminated manuscript plat map from
  her Haiti property dated 1972. </p><p>Rounding out the collection are a group of
  6 programs from the 1940s and 1950s, including her important “Tropical Revue”, “Bal
  Negre," and “Caribbean Rhapsody" tours. An undated broadside advertises an early
  show at the Palacios de Bellas Artes in Mexico. The earliest item is a 1935 steamship
  passenger list listing Miss K. Dunham as a first-class passenger. </p><p>Manuscript
  diaries from cultural figures of Dunham''s significance are not often seen on the
  market. This one is not only intellectually vigorous and deeply personal, it is
  also embellished by the context of photographs, letters, and other documents. A
  more detailed inventory is available upon request.</p>'

FOOTNOTE: 'At the heart of this lot is her 42-page personal diary, mostly kept in
  1958 while in Tokyo writing her memoir. It is a mix of traditional diary entries
  with bits of memoir and literary reflection. Typed passages from earlier volumes
  and other memoranda are frequently taped, stapled, or laid in. The entries range
  from lyrical landscape descriptions, to anthropological observations on Japanese
  culture, to bracingly frank comments on her personal life. Two recurring characters
  are her Japanese maid and the maid''s boyfriend, a rockabilly enthusiast who absconded
  with a small sum of money. Dunham attended a Japanese rockabilly concert and reflected
  on its layers of cultural appropriation: “Rockabilly show at Nichegeki with teenagers
  like reeking wet sardines throwing streamers and walking on stage embracing match-stick-legged
  performers in heavy ankle-high white rubber-soled moccasins . . . . Imitating Presley
  who imitates every blues shouter there ever was. I think of Joe Turner and Kokomo
  and Winona of Central Avenue when the big-busted oily-haired sisters walked onto
  the floor in ecstasy and put their dollar bills earned in Hollywood cleaning up
  after all-night brawls at Turner’s and Winona’s feet, real ecstasy rocking their
  bodies & shining their eyes. This is so puerile" (2 June 1958). In a similar vein,
  she wrote “When all else has come & gone the Blues will remain deeply, securely
  embedded in the substratum of American culture. Constant reminder of Black races.
  Triumph” (5 February). The blues remained on her mind in Tokyo: "The workmen sound
  like Josh White singing a work song. It will help them through the night" (11 February).
  Among the bits of memoir interweaved into the text, she recalls serving as a flower
  girl at countless funerals in Joliet; discusses writing a disturbing passage on
  her father ("I left off at eleven last night unravelling Albert Dunham’s incestuous
  desire for his daughter"); and proclaims “The aggregate of Israelites evacuating
  the land of the pharoas could have felt no greater relief or keener joy than I did
  when I at last left Joliet for good.” Her complex marriage to John Pratt is discussed
  at length in one passage written on 2 November while in Haiti. <br><br>In moments
  of intellectual detachment came more abstract observations: “Only upon the historian,
  the biographer falls the task of accuracy. The rest of us write things as we see
  them, or as we remember them to be. To make them believable, to live. Herein lies
  our artistry" (21 April). Typed passages reflect on her philosophy of dance: “For
  a dancer the association must be voluntary, the spirit free, and the flesh willing;
  the aims multiple and common. . . . Perhaps because there is no actual necessity
  for tools, material, artifacts, the dance was perhaps the earliest artistic expression—and
  its psychokinesthetic usage gave it real urgency beyond other creative arts. . .
  . My mission is not to present beauty but to present truth. If the two go hand in
  hand, how fortunate I am.” <br><br>'
