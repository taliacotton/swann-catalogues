FOOTNOTE: "Jeff Donaldson (1932-2004) is best known as a visual artist and as a founder of the AfriCOBRA group. Early in his career he also produced this satirical work, in which he lampoons every \"type\"--conservative and militant civil rights leaders, the Southern chief of police, Northern liberals, and more. In the true spirit of the equal-opportunity offender, the final illustration is a mocking self-portrait of the artist at his easel, with one eye reading \"Freedom Now\" and the other with a dollar sign."
