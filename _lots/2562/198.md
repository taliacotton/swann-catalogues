FOOTNOTE: The 2015 reference book Picturing Frederick Douglass includes 160 known
  photographic portraits of Douglass, who was the most photographed American of the
  19th century. This handsome profile portrait, however, is not included. Another
  portrait by the same photographer, also dated 1878, appears to be from the same
  sitting. Only one other example of this portrait is known, an unsigned copy which
  brought $18,750 in Swann's 28 March 2019 auction. <br><br>The photographer Samuel
  Montague Fassett (1825-1910) first photographed Douglass in 1864. Fassett's wife
  Clara was an artist. In 1879 she painted "The Florida Case in Open Sessions Before
  the Electoral Commission, February 5, 1877," with Frederick Douglass appearing in
  the lower right. She depicted him in a similar profile view, possibly using this
  pose as a reference.
