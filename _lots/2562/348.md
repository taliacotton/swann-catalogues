Raised in poverty in Massachusetts, she and her husband Nero Prince moved to Russia, where he served as a footman in the czar's court and she ran a boarding house. She later did a missionary stint among the recently emancipated Jamaicans, experiencing close encounters with slavery in Florida and New Orleans on her voyage home. Afro-Americana 8486 (this edition); Blockson 269 (third edition); not in Clark's Travels in the New South."
