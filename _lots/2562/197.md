It is most notable for its ownership signatures, most notably the author's contemporary and fellow writer John Wesley Cromwell, who was born into slavery and went on to law school and an influential career as an activist. Some of the marginal notes are substantial, some correct factual errors, and at least one is personal: when Williams references the Institute for Colored Youth on page II:176, Cromwell writes \"My alma mater.\" <br><br><br><br>Provenance: family of John Wesley Cromwell (1846-1927) through his daughter Otelia Cromwell (1874-1972), a noted literary scholar; and granddaughter Adelaide M. Cromwell (1919-2019), an important sociologist."
