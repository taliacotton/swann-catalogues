FOOTNOTE: "One of the more important single issues of William Lloyd Garrison's Liberator, with the entire first page and beyond devoted to the text and analysis of the 6 March Dred Scott v. Sandford Supreme Court decision which shook the abolitionist movement. It begins under the headline \"Refuge of Oppression\" with a lengthy summary and extract of the court's majority opinion as issued by Chief Justice Taney, followed by the editorials issued elsewhere by the national press. The New York Tribune declared \"America the slave breeder and slaveholder!\" Much of page 2 is devoted to a long extract from the noble-minded dissenting opinion of Justice Curtis."
