CROSSHEAD: Group of 14 photographs of early Jacob Lawrence paintings, most of them
  now lost.
TYPESET: 14 black and white photographs, each 7 x 9 or 8 x 10 inches, each with various
  period stamps and labels on verso; minor wear.
at-a-glance: New York and Washington, circa October 1944
FOOTNOTE: 'Jacob Lawrence (1917-2000) first came to national prominence as an artist
  in 1941 with his 60-panel Great Migration series. He was drafted into the Coast
  Guard in 1943 and served in public affairs aboard the ship Sea Cloud, the first
  integrated warship in the United States since the Civil War. Lawrence produced approximately
  48 paintings for the Coast Guard during this period, capturing the spirit of men
  at sea. In October 1944, the Coast Guard collaborated with the Museum of Modern
  Art in New York on a Jacob Lawrence exhibition, which featured the entire Great
  Migration series and 8 of his new Coast Guard paintings. Almost the entire body
  of his Coast Guard output is now lost. <br><br><br><br>Offered here are 14 promotional
  photographs of these Coast Guard paintings. Most notable are photographs of 5 paintings
  which did not appear in "Jacob Lawrence: Paintings, Drawings, and Murals, a Catalog
  Raisonn√©" by Nesbett and Dubois in 2000--in other words, their existence was not
  then otherwise known to Lawrence scholarship, although a file has since been located
  at the National Archives. These are titled "Checker Game," "Handling Line," "Machinist
  Mate," "Worship," and "Wrestlers." Of these 5, one ("Handling Line") was later reproduced
  in John Ott''s article "Battle Station MoMA: Jacob Lawrence and the Desegregation
  of the Armed Forces and the Art World" in American Art 29:3 (Fall 2015). These five
  paintings do not appear to have been included in the MoMA exhibition. Each had a
  typed caption from the Coast Guard''s Public Information Division laid down on verso,
  with a few sentences of description interpreting the painting and extolling Lawrence''s
  importance. For example, the caption for "Machinist Mate" (illustrated) reads "A
  Coast Guard machinist''s mate solders wire in the engine room of a Coast Guard-manned
  troop transport in this impressionistic watercolor by Coast Guard Combat Artist
  Jacob A. Lawrence of Brooklyn, N.Y. The brilliant young Negro artist has caught
  the cramped working conditions and the feeling of machinery in this bold depiction
  of life aboard ship." "Handling Line" similarly shows Coast Guardsmen examining
  their lines for signs of wear. "Worship" depicts a "service in the Jewish faith
  aboard a Coast Guard-manned troop transport. His pulpit is marked with the Star
  of David." "Checkers" and "Wrestlers" depict recreational activities to break the
  shipboard tedium; one of the checker players sports a prominent tattoo and has his
  cigarette precariously balanced on a stack of game pieces. <br><br><br><br>Even
  more than with most artists, a Jacob Lawrence reproduction without color is hardly
  a substitute for the original--but for some of these paintings, it may be all we
  have. <br><br><br><br>7 of the photographs ("General Quarters," "Holy Stoning the
  Deck," "Officer''s Steward," "Prayer," two different paintings titled "Recreation,"
  and "Signal Practice") have shorter title labels from the Coast Guard, short exhibit
  labels from the Museum of Modern Art, and stamps indicating that the photographs
  were shot by MOMA staff photographer Soichi Sunami, presumably to publicize the
  October 1944 exhibition. These are 7 of the 8 Coast Guard paintings which were displayed
  at MoMA, although in these cases at least reproduction images survive elsewhere.
  Similarly, photographs of "Anchor on Cart" and "Bakers" show paintings which have
  been reproduced elsewhere, even if the originals is unknown.'
