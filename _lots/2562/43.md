FOOTNOTE: "Slavery came to the Cape of Good Hope in 1658 under the Dutch East Indian Company, with slaves imported widely from elsewhere in southern Africa as well as the Indian subcontinent and Indonesia. The British continued slavery after occupying the Cape in 1795, until its abolition throughout the empire in 1834. These documents show the sale of a 21-year-old housemaid named Dina by the vendue master of Cape Town to Edward George on 29 July 1817, and then again the following day from George to Jacob Van Reenen, as recorded by the Office for the Enregisterment of Slaves."
