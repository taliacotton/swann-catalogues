FOOTNOTE: "Uel Merrill Fisk (1823-1911) was a white Universalist pastor and lecturer on the radical abolitionist lecture circuit in the years leading up to the war. Though he was not a household name in his day, he was an active soldier in the good fight. The lectures seen here are remarkably direct and strident, and offered his audiences a clear vision of the institutional roots of slavery, inspiring in them a sense of immediacy for the complete defeat of slave power. He did most of his work in western New York, other than a short stint as pastor in Taunton, MA in the late 1850s. In 1872, he removed to rural Galena, MO, where he spent the remainder of his long life.<br><br><br><br>\"Review of the Recent Strife between Freedom and Slavery, and the Indications of the Future,\" parts 1, 2 and 3. [51], [41], [57] pages in 3 volumes. A series of lectures which provides a detailed history of the anti-slavery movement from the 1830s through 1850s, and of the powerful institutional forces which suppressed it; also foresees the inevitable Civil War more than 4 years before Fort Sumter. First delivered at Potsdam, NY on 7 and 14 December 1856, and then in whole or part on 6 occasions in 1857-59 and 1866. <br><br><br><br>\"Secession No. 3: The True Foundation of Government.\" [56] pages. First delivered in Taunton, [MA?], May 1861, and then on 4 other occasions through 1864. <br><br><br><br>Fragments of two different lectures discussing the recent Emancipation Proclamation. [35] and [19] pages, circa 1863. <br><br><br><br>Untitled lecture beginning \"Ladies and gentlemen, I come before you tonight with some embarrassment.\" [87] pages, delivered in LeRoy [NY?], October 1864. <br><br><br><br>Fragment of a lecture, beginning \"I said the rebellion of Jereboam against the tyranny of a base king was right.\" [35] pages, circa 1864. Includes a passage which gives a good sense of Fisk's rhetoric: \"They revolted from the most liberal government ever established, a government in which they had more than their equal share, they revolted for the sole purpose of maintaining their political ascendancy, and retaining the power to hold a weaker race in bondage. . . . This is not a rebellion from oppression, but for the purpose of oppression; not to secure a right, but to retain the power to rob others of their rights.\" (pages 17-19). <br><br><br><br>Untitled lecture on the upcoming November 1868 election, beginning \"The time is rapidly approaching when the Constitution of our country will call upon us to elect our rulers.\" [128] pages in 3 loosely stitched gatherings. Argues near the end that \"if any man ever earned the right to the ballot, it is the black men of the south.\""
