FOOTNOTE: "First edition. This Andrew Jackson (most definitely not the president) was legally born free to an enslaved father and a free mother in Kentucky, but was nonetheless raised in slavery and did field work until his eventual escape as a young man. He made his way to Wisconsin and did some lecturing for the abolitionist cause. This memoir was \"narrated by himself, written by a friend,\" and concludes with 3 abolitionist \"Songs of Freedom\" by other authors. The friend was likely John N.T. Tucker, an author, newspaperman and abolitionist activist who was a Syracuse resident at the time. The Preface is signed \"T\", and one of the poems, titled Fugitive's Triumph, is by \"J.N.T.T.\" <br><br><br><br>Sabin 35392 and Work, page 312 (both noting only the 1847 edition); not in Afro-Americana or Blockson; see also Jackson's entry in the Kentucky African American Encyclopedia. Only one in OCLC (State Library of Pennsylvania, in worse condition than this one), and none traced at auction; a much longer 1847 second edition (\"Narrative and Writings\") followed."
