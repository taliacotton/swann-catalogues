at-a-glance: "New York and Atlanta, GA: various publishers, 1964 copyright"
FOOTNOTE: "A large portrait of Dr. King is juxtaposed with the entirety of his 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech, with a small outline of Africa below. This poster has perhaps the most complicated credit lines we have ever seen, including (but not limited to) the School of African-American Arts, Blackness Incorporated, Great Great Grandchildren Publishing Co., African-American Art International Publishing Company (New York), and Culture Task Force (Atlanta). The designer and copyright holder Richard McCrary also did a popular Angela Davis poster, \"I Am a Black Woman!\", in 1971. The copyright here is given as 1964, but the design and lettering look more like a 1970s production."
