Each bears a Hansen inked stamp on verso. 3 of them are addressed \"232 West 135th Street, New York 30\" before the 1963 introduction of ZIP codes; 3 have the same address with a 10030 ZIP code (one of them dated 1984); and the remaining 4 are addressed \"1974 Belmont Avenue, Bronx, N.Y. 10457.\" These last 4 are all group portraits taken in the same room, apparently a church basement.
