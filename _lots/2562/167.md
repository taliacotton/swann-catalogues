at-a-glance: "Atlanta, GA: Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, [August 1963]"
FOOTNOTE: "This petition was issued to defend the \"Albany Nine,\" who faced long prison sentences in southern Georgia for daring to picket a segregationist store owner. The struggles of these Georgia activists are described in detail. The boldfaced title, \"Marchers for Jobs and Freedom,\" suggests that a march was planned in Georgia. Actually, this petition was handed out in conjunction with the 28 August 1963 March for Freedom in Washington. An article of that date in the Knoxville News-Sentinel describes its distribution aboard a trainload of marchers headed north from Florida: \"As the train moved north, a white girl wearing glasses--one of a dozen white persons aboard--circulated a petition demanding that the federal indictment against the Albany Nine be dropped.\" None traced in OCLC or at auction, though one is held among the Eliza Paschall Papers at Emory University."
