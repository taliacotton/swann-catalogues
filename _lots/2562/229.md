at-a-glance: "Newark, 29 October [1880] (printed in New York by Richardson & Foos)"
FOOTNOTE: "This performance featured Mrs. G.C. Howard in her original role as Topsy, and Mr. Howard as St. Clair. The Howards created these roles in 1852 and continued to play them for more than 30 years. Uncle Tom was played by \"Cool White\", the white minstrel performer John Hodges, who performed with the Howard company from 1879 and 1882. Among the supporting cast were \"genuine Southern Colored Folk--Men, Women and Children\"--most of whom were slaves in Georgia, Alabama and Virginia prior to the war,\" as well as the \"Virginia Colored Slave Troupe of Jubilee Singers.\" The performance took place at the New Park Theatre in Newark, presumably Delaware rather than New Jersey--the troupe performed in nearby Wilmington the night before."
