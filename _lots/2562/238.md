FOOTNOTE: "The Unity Club was founded in Boston as a social and mutual benefit association for young Black men. This program serves as their yearbook, including a history, list of members, frontispiece portrait of their president, words to their theme song composed by Eugene Alexander Burkes, exterior and interior views of their clubhouse at 228 West Canton Street, and copious illustrated advertisements for local businesses. Although it was apparently a large and successful organization, we find none of its materials at auction or in OCLC, and it seems to be largely forgotten today."
