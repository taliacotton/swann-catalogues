FOOTNOTE: "For this performance at an historically Black university, Robeson delivered a diverse program including Russian folk songs, \"Negro melodies,\" a \"Chassidic chant,\" and the patriotic cantata \"Ballad for Americans.\" His selections alternated with pieces performed on the theremin (an eerie-sounding electronic instrument) by its first and only notable virtuoso, Clara Rockmore. <br><br><br><br>The local Newport News Daily Press (4 October 1941) described this as Robeson's first-ever performance in the South, a bold and surprising claim, as Robeson had been performing internationally for decades by that point."
