TYPESET: "Photograph, 8 x 10 inches, signed \"Big Sid Catlett\" at left, \"Earl 'Fatha' Hines\" at top center, and \"To Nelson, Louis Armstrong\" just below; signatures somewhat faded, minimal wear, tape remnants on verso, uncaptioned and uncredited."
at-a-glance: "Np, [1948-49]"
FOOTNOTE: "Earl Hines and Louis Armstrong first collaborated early in their careers circa 1927, but this photograph dates from the period after Hines joined Louis Armstrong and His All-Stars in 1948. Hines is not fully visible in the photo, but is wedged in to Armstrong's right. Also visible on the small stage are drummer Sid Catlett (who left the group in May 1949), clarinetist Barney Bigard, Jack Teagarden on trombone, and bassist Arvell Shaw. Two other shots from this same gig are held at the Louis Armstrong House Museum."
