FOOTNOTE: "The Lincoln Settlement was established in 1908 to provide services to poor families in Brooklyn, including a day nursery and kindergarten to support working mothers, plus a variety of classes and clubs for older children. Their building was at 105 Fleet Place between downtown Brooklyn and Fort Greene Park. Its founders were Verina Morton-Jones, a Black physician who left her practice in 1914 to provide daily leadership to the Settlement (as discussed here), and Mary White Ovington, a white crusader for racial justice, listed here as the Settlement's president. Both women were also among the key founders of the NAACP. The Settlement was later absorbed into the New York Urban League. This is the earliest publication of the Lincoln Settlement listed in OCLC, which traces just one copy."
