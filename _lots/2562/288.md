FOOTNOTE: "Margaret Perkins Simmons (1921-1996) was born in Texas and was living in Washington, DC in late 1943 when she enlisted in the Women's Army Corps. She served in the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion--the only overseas battalion composed entirely of Black women. This collection consists mostly of photographs, including 4 English press photos of her battalion marching in formation in Birmingham, England, [1945]; 7 postcard-sized photographs of the battalion marching in formation; 2 formal color portraits of Simmons (one of them signed by Congressman Adam Clayton Powell); and 39 other personal photographs of Simmons and her fellow WACs and their wartime travels in Europe. Among the war-related ephemera is a letter of thanks from President Truman with his printed signature; and a clipping naming Simmons as guitarist in a 10-piece WAC orchestra. Among the numerous civilian papers are a card issued to Simmons by the New York Institute of Photography in 1939; and a group of 16 entertainment-industry publicity photographs of minor celebrities, some signed, and at least one with a \"Photo by Simmons\" stamp. As Margaret Fouche, she settled in the San Francisco area after the war."
