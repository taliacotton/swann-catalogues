He carries a suspicious spirit against the men who have best served the republic. He only dreams of plots, gatherings, and uprising\").

Ils seront toujour bons, humains et amis des lois\" (\"the Blacks received their former masters with open arms, and will always be good, humane and friends of the law\").
