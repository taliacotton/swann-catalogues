  Wheatley (circa 1753-1784) was born in Senegal and sold into American slavery when
  she was about eight years old. She was permitted an unusual degree of formal education
  by her owner, a Boston merchant named John Wheatley, who encouraged her literary
  efforts. On a visit to England in 1773, she arranged the publication of this volume
  of poems, and was given her manumission shortly afterward. Her poetry came to the
  attention of George Washington, Thomas Paine, John Paul Jones, and Thomas Jefferson,
  but she nonetheless worked as a scullery maid to pay her bills, and died in poverty
  at the age of 31.</p><p>This volume includes, in addition to Wheatley''s poems,
  a dedication to the Countess of Huntington who had sponsored the publication, Wheatley''s
  two-page preface, and an endorsement by her owner John Wheatley. It also includes
  a remarkable endorsement by a board of 17 distinguished Bostonians including Governor
  Thomas Hutchinson and future governor John Hancock, announcing that "we whose names
  are under-written, do assure the World, that the Poems . . . were (as we verily
  believe) written by Phillis, a young Negro Girl, who was but a few Years since,
  brought an uncultivated Barbarian from Africa, and has ever since been, and now
  is, under the Disadvantage of serving as a Slave in a Family in this Town." </p><p>The
  iconic frontispiece portrait of Wheatley is present and well-preserved. It is often
  credited to Scipio Moorhead, who much like Wheatley practiced his craft while in
  a state of slavery in Boston. A poem in this volume is dedicated to him: "To S.M.
  a young African Painter, on seeing his works" (pages 114-5).</p>'
