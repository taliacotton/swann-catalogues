FOOTNOTE: "The activist James Meredith was hit with a shotgun blast on the second day of his March Against Fear from Memphis to Mississippi. In the first of these images of the shooting, the assailant Aubrey James Norvell can be seen in the roadside shrubbery to the far left. For the second image, the photographer Jack Thornell has apparently run directly toward where the assailant had been, spun around, and caught Meredith dragging himself toward cover. Thornell won the Pulitzer Prize for these photographs. <br><br><br><br>Meredith survived the attack. Martin Luther King and others completed the march on his behalf, and Meredith was able to join them in Jackson nineteen days later."
