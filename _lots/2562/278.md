FOOTNOTE: "The author of this series, Dr. Edward Bliss Foote (1829-1906) was a white physician, birth control and public hygiene advocate, and civil rights advocate. This very unusual series introduces children to medicine and anatomy via a young Black man and his pet, a \"troublesome monkey.\" Foote covered some difficult territory in Volume 5, which bears a preface that some may find it \"unsuitable to children.\" The female and male reproduction systems are shown in graphic (but not very erotic) cutaways on pages 180½ and 180¾ (\"this leaf can be cut out if thought advisable\"). Yet more controversially, Sammy is described as escorting young Miss Julia Barkenstir to her home, where he gave her a not very platonic kiss goodnight in the doorway--shown here in a half-page engraving on page 203. It is believed to be the first interracial kiss depicted in the United States. The \"Publishers' Announcement\" on pages 228-230 of Volume 1 reveals that the numerous illustrations throughout the volumes are mostly from original pen-and-ink sketches by prominent illustrator Henry Louis Stephens.
