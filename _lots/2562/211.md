at-a-glance: "Washington, 1911"
FOOTNOTE: "This group photograph shows 5 instructors and 10 graduates (each named with their home states). The original 15 portraits and campus view were presumably done by Addison N. Scurlock (1883-1964), Washington's seminal Black photographer, who had just opened his first studio in 1911. They were then mounted as a collage with original artwork by Horace G. Anderson (1885-1971), a little-known Black artist who attended Howard and later exhibited in one of the Harmon Foundation shows in 1930. Finally, the collage was photographed and reproduced for the graduates by Scurlock, whose stylized signature \"Scurlock, photo\" appears in the negative."
