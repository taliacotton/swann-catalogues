FOOTNOTE: Charles White expressed his support for the imprisoned activist Angela Davis
  in several ways, most prominently by authorizing the reproduction of his recent
  lithograph "Love Letter 1" in this appeal by the National United Committee to Free
  Angela Davis and All Political Prisoners. The card was intended to be filled out
  as a sort of petition to California's governor Ronald Reagan. It reads in part "Dear
  Governor Reagan . . . Because we truly believe that she is being denied the presumption
  of innocence and equal protection under the law . . . we ask you, as Governor, to
  intercede for the release of Angela Davis on reasonable bail." Ironically, the card's
  beauty probably undercut its effectiveness, as this and other copies were saved
  rather than mailed in. Beegan & Gustafson, Angela Davis pages 54, 56.
