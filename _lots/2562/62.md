TYPESET: "4 pages, 7 x 5 inches, printed in black and red on one folding sheet; minimal wear. With original printed envelope addressed to Governor Reagan."
at-a-glance: "San Francisco, CA, 1971"
FOOTNOTE: "Charles White expressed his support for the imprisoned activist Angela Davis in several ways, most prominently by authorizing the reproduction of his recent lithograph \"Love Letter 1\" in this appeal by the National United Committee to Free Angela Davis and All Political Prisoners. The card was intended to be filled out as a sort of petition to California's governor Ronald Reagan. It reads in part \"Dear Governor Reagan . . . Because we truly believe that she is being denied the presumption of innocence and equal protection under the law . . . we ask you, as Governor, to intercede for the release of Angela Davis on reasonable bail.\" Ironically, the card's beauty probably undercut its effectiveness, as this and other copies were saved rather than mailed in. Beegan & Gustafson, Angela Davis pages 54, 56."
