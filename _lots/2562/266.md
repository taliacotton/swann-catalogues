FOOTNOTE: '"Fire!!" was a controversial and extremely short-lived literary magazine
  edited by Wallace Thurman (1902-1934). Ahead of its time for its frank discussion
  of interracial romance, prostitution, and homosexuality, it met with a hostile response
  from the old guard of the Black press, and folded shortly after the release of its
  November 1926 first issue when its offices burned. <br><br><br><br>This circular
  letter, sent in the brief window between the first issue and the magazine''s demise,
  seeks donations and/or subscriptions. Listed alongside Thurman on the editorial
  staff are a cavalcade of heavyweights: Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Gwendolyn
  Bennett, and Aaron Douglas (who may well have done the art for this letterhead).
  Thurman writes: “Dear Friend: The first issue of FIRE has blazed its way into the
  historic annals of the American Negroe literary movement. . . . FIRE was and is
  a literary experiment. . . . You have no doubt seen the first issue, and have been
  either flabbergasted, shocked, surprised, or pleased. At any rate you have been
  provoked to some emotion. . . . Now won’t you do your share and send us either a
  subscription or a patron’s check?”'
