FOOTNOTE: "Charles J. Jack (1812-1873) was a Brooklyn liquor store owner, often referred to in the press as \"Colonel C.J. Jack.\" He had been an active nativist in Philadelphia in the 1840s, and then became involved in New York politics. This is the original manuscript of an anti-slavery speech he gave shortly before the Civil War. While stating emphatically that he is no abolitionist, Jack emphasizes the importance of preserving the Union. This speech contains none of the rhetoric usually found in the anti-slavery arguments. Sabin 35336 (the published speech)."
