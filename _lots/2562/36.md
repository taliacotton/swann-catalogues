Posey and several other men from Indiana where this book was published. The region was generally pro-slavery, and the Anti-Slavery League was established there to aid runaway slaves in an organized manner, rather than, in the author's words \"the haphazard way it was being done.\" Not in Afro-Americana or Blockson."
