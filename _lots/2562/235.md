FOOTNOTE: "Matthew Henson (1866-1955) was Robert Peary's second in command on several polar expeditions, and most notably was one of the party of six which claimed the North Pole in April 1909. He is here shown in later life, a middle-aged man in a suit filing papers at the New York Customs House, with scenes of Inuits, icebergs, and dogsleds still dancing through his mind. The caption explains that a local Congressman was pushing through a bill to honor Henson with a medal in \"belated recognition of his heroism\" as \"the only member of his race to have ever reached the North Pole.\""
