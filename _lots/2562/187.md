White Christian hypocrisy, capitalism, and open immigration are dismantled in turn.

Work, page 88; not in Afro-Americana or Blockson. <br><br><br><br>Provenance: family of author and activist John Wesley Cromwell (1846-1927) through his daughter Otelia Cromwell (1874-1972), a noted literary scholar; granddaughter Adelaide M. Cromwell (1919-2019), an important sociologist."
