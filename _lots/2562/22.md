FOOTNOTE: "This certificate was issued to Anthony Willis, described as \"a black man . . . about the age of twenty eight years, and was born at Suffolk County in the State of New York . . . about five feet six inches, has dark eyes and black hair.\" In this two-part document, Peter Connor testifies that he has known Willis for two years, and that during that time Willis \"hath been reputed and considered to be free, and hath continually acted as a free man during the said time, and that the said Anthony was born free.\" Below, judge and alderman Charles Dickinson certifies \"I am of the opinion, and do adjudge that the said Anthony is free according to the laws of this State . . . and that he was born free.\" The heavy wear to this document suggests that Willis may have carried it on his person at all times for many years."
