Many of the poems in this collection relate to Reconstruction; also included is a short story, \"Shalmanezer, Prince of Cosman.\" \"Mrs. Harper's verse is frankly propagandist, a metrical extension of her life dedicated to the welfare of others. She believed in art for humanity's sake\"--Joan Sherman, Invisible Poets: Afro-Americans of the Nineteenth Century, page 67. This edition not listed in Porter, North American Negro Poets, page 43; one copy of this edition listed in OCLC, at Temple University. No copies of any edition traced at auction since 2004.

Crosby (1828-1921) was a prominent Iowa attorney and advocate for \"education of the negro\" according to his obituary; purchased by the consignor at a Crosby family estate sale, 2016."
