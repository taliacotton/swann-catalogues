In the room-by-room inventory, they were listed in the section headed \"Kitchen Furniture,\" followed by \"9 common Windsor chairs\" and a small table. <br><br><br><br>New Jersey passed a \"Gradual Abolition Act\" in 1804, but it was even more gradual than in most northern states. The state's 16 final remaining enslaved people were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865."
