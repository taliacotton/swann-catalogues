FOOTNOTE: "Sancho escaped from a Mississippi plantation and was presumed to have made his way north. His owner ran this advertisement in distant Boston, offering a reward of up to $100 for his return. Sancho is described as \"a Negro man, thirty years of age, about 5 feet high, very black complexion . . . & a fast walker.\" Sancho was said to be a skilled barber and \"was born and educated in his Master's house\"; he was thought to be so loyal that he must have \"been inveigled away by some artful villains for their own use.\" Winthrop Sargent (1753-1820), who wrote and submitted the notice, was a Massachusetts native and former Revolutionary War officer who had served as governor of Mississippi Territory and then settled down to operate a plantation in Natchez, MS. While runaway ads were common in newspapers of this era, few were illustrated. This particular ad, which ran for a few days in late September and early October of 1807, is one of the better-known ones. The National Portrait Gallery acquired one, giving Sancho a permanent home among the nation's most famous faces."
