FOOTNOTE: "This newspaper was an unusual collaboration between radical German student groups and Black GI's stationed in Germany, in an attempt to forge revolutionary solidarity across racial and national lines. The content draws heavily from Black Panther news gleaned from back in the States, but also has extensive information about the unique problems faced by the soldiers, including disciplinary hearings or abuse of soldiers who spoke out against racism. A 10-point manifesto printed in several issues mainly relates to the soldiers' grievances, including a call for abolishing the Uniformed Court of Military Justice, freedom for war resistors, and an end to the military caste system. The newspaper was not popular among the officer ranks, and each issue bore a disclaimer along the lines of \"This paper is legal, but the pigs will probably bust anyone caught reading it.\" The first three issues have a printed slip tipped to the front page, dated 14 May 1971 and protesting the recent arrest of co-editor Larry Barnes."
