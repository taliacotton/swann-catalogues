FOOTNOTE: "The great abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison began his publishing career in Baltimore in 1829, and quickly got into hot water by calling Francis Todd and Captain Nicholas Brown \"highway robbers and murderers\" for shipping 75 slaves in chains from Baltimore to New Orleans. He was successfully sued for libel in Maryland court, refused to pay the fine, and spent seven weeks in prison. This helped launch Garrison to national prominence in abolitionist circles, and became a well-known episode in his biography. An unnamed party in Baltimore apparently got sick of hearing that his arrest was due to the slavery-loving people of Maryland, and produced this pamphlet many years after the trial. It sets out to demonstrate with long excerpts from the trial that the jurors were actually opposed to slavery, and that Garrison was convicted because he had actually libeled the two slavers. Sabin 26710. None traced at auction."
