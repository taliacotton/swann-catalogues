FOOTNOTE: "Poster from a short-lived but important all-female jazz orchestra which toured the United States in the mid-1940s. A month before this performance, the band's bassist Toby Butler was arrested in Milledgeville, GA for breaking segregation laws, for performing as a white woman in an otherwise all-Black band. Band leader Jessie Turner remarked that \"she didn't see why a few women from Mars would matter as long as the band is a good one\" (Birmingham Weekly Review, 13 July 1946)."
