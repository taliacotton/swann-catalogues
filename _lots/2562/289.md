FOOTNOTE: "An interesting grouping from a touring show staged by and for Black servicemen across Hawaii. The director was Corporal Milton J. Williams, who had acted on Broadway in \"Cabin in the Sky.\" The actors were a mix of servicemen and local talent, including actress Betty Balingit, billed as \"Hilo's Shirley Temple.\" A manuscript sheet (apparently used for introductions) gives the credentials of the Harlem Sultans sextet, featuring a veteran of Fletcher Henderson's orchestra. The photographs show the band and actors at work, as well as a crowd of uniformed soldiers watching from their mess hall benches."
