FOOTNOTE: "An entertaining little cartoon book with unexpected heft. Alice Crolley Browning (1907-1985) was an author, editor, founder of the International Black Writers Conference, and longtime Chicago elementary school teacher. This small pamphlet is unsigned, but also appears in her papers at the Chicago Public Library. Described as \"Tiny Giants Series #2,\" it was a sequel to the author's even scarcer \"It's No Fun to Be Black\" from 1972. The language is hipper and more militant than one might expect from a retired teacher. Vignettes include \"It's fun to go to the Loop and see Black Panthers slinking all over . . . selling Black Panther News\" and \"It's fun to see all the Black mayors and realize that there will be a Black president of the U.S.A., one of these days.\" She also name-checks poet Sam Greenlee, James Brown, Dick Gregory, and Jesse Jackson. The lively illustrations are signed \"RTMc.\" 5 in OCLC."
