Even bigger than the President at that point in history was boxer Muhammad Ali, who visited the troops in South Korea for an exhibition performance on 27 June 1976. He is here seen sparring with Private First Class Larry D. Price in a makeshift hillside ring. <br><br><br><br>The other 17 photographs are less dramatic, but most show an Army soldier named Johnson (his nametag is visible in one shot) relaxing with friends; two show baseball practices and two others show locals drinking in a bar."
