at-a-glance: "Tuckahoe, NY, 9 July 1944"
FOOTNOTE: "Cullen writes: \"I have read the article you sent me and find it very provocative but I do not feel that I want to tackle the job myself. Criticism is not one of my strong points. You might try sending it to Professor Sterling Brown at Howard University, Washington D.C. He is both a good poet and a good critic. I imagine he would be interested in doing such an article for you.\" The letter's recipient was likely the influential drama critic and editor Joseph T. Shipley of The New Leader, with whom Cullen has previously corresponded in 1933."
