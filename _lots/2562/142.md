FOOTNOTE: "Two evocative images of early 20th-century barber shops staffed by Black barbers. What seems to be the earlier of the two images shows 4 barbers standing at their chairs, and an assistant (bearing a whisk broom). In the background can be seen a sign for Rapides Bank and the store of Jonas Rosenthal, placing the scene in Alexandria, LA. The later image shows 3 barbers at their chairs, with one of the chairs holding a young White boy as a customer. The window sign reads \"George's Barber Shop.\" The barber in the foreground of this photograph is almost certainly the same man at the rear chair in the earlier image. <br><br><br><br>George's Barber Shop at 1210 2nd Street was in operation from at least 1922 to 1941. It was managed by George W. Moore (circa 1883-1942), a Black man who operated a \"white shop\" according to the Alexandria Town Talk of 10 August 1933. City directories show that prior to launching George's, Moore was a barber at the Rapides Hotel from at least 1912 to 1914; perhaps the earlier image was taken at the hotel."
