FOOTNOTE: "Brothers William Hinde (1773-1834) and Samuel Hinde (1778-1840) of Liverpool
  were sons of notorious slave trader Thomas Hinde, and as this letter shows, continued
  to pursue those profits after their father's 1799 death until the bitter end. This
  letter is addressed to their agent in the Caribbean. They quote their own 14 July
  letter advising him that \"you will be able to effect advantageous sales, either
  there or at Tobago, where slaves are much liked. The late measures adopted by the
  legislature here for limiting the numbers of ships employed in the trade to those
  already engaged in it, and the pledge entered into by both houses to abolish the
  trade next sessions, are circumstances which in our opinion must tend to advance
  the prices with you.\" \n\nStill waiting for a reply, they clarified their instructions
  a month later. They urged Lucas to bring home \"the ship to this port with quick
  dispatch, in order that we may get her cleared if possible on another voyage prior
  to the Act of Abolition being passed. It is of great consequence in a new and burthensome
  vessell like the Trafalgar that she should have a full freight\" or \"she will not
  make one farthing, owing to the very heavy expences on new ships, and the high rate
  of insurance paid on African risques.\"\n\nThe Slave Trade Act would indeed be passed
  in March 1807, banning any British ship from leaving on a slaving voyage after 1
  May. This letter shows that the brothers Hinde were eager to squeeze every last
  drop of profit from this trade before it became illegal."
