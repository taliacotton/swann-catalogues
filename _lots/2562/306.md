FOOTNOTE: "This concert took place just as these three acts were exploding on the national scene, making hip hop an MTV phenomenon. Run-DMC had been recording and performing since 1983. Their popular third album Raising Hell had been released 6 days earlier. The album's \"Walk this Way\" from the album would drop as a single on 4 July and become an enormous rock-rap crossover hit. Opening act Whodini had been recording since 1982 and was at the peak of their popularity. LL Cool J's first album had just been released the previous November, and on 1 March he had become the first hip hop artist on American Bandstand. He received third billing for the concert. This 21 May 1986 show at the Municipal Auditorium in Columbus, Georgia was the opening night of the legendary tour, here described as the \"Raising *ell Tour.\""
