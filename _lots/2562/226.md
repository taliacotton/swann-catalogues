FOOTNOTE: "Ira Frederick Aldridge (1807-1867) was an African-American actor who was born in New York but emigrated in 1824 in search of greater opportunities. He slowly worked his way up through the regional theaters of Great Britain and Ireland, often billing himself as a native of Africa. He was brought in to play Othello at Covent Garden's Theatre Royal for his first opportunity at one of London's leading theaters. His engagement as Othello lasted for only two performances, but he went on to a long career as one of England's leading actors. He is the only actor of African descent to be honored with a plaque at the Shakespeare Memorial Theater. <br><br><br><br>This playbill advertises Aldridge's groundbreaking first Covent Garden appearance as Othello. It promises a performance two days hence of \"Shakespeare's tragedy of Othello, the part of Othello by Mr. Aldridge, known by the appellation of the African Roscius, who has been received with great applause at the Theatres Royal, Dublin, Edinburgh, Bath, and most of the principal provincial theatres. (His first appearance on this stage.)\" See Hovde, \"Ira Aldridge Takes the Stage,\" on the Folger Shakespeare Library blog, which is illustrated with a 10 April playbill. A pair of double-sized broadsides from Aldridge's Covent Garden performances appeared in Swann's 28 March 2019 auction; we are aware of none others at auction."
