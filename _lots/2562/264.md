FOOTNOTE: "A complete run of the important run of Philadelphia's short-lived but influential literary magazine, \"Black Opals,\" closely tied to the Harlem Renaissance. Subtitled \"Hail Negro Youth,\" it featured work by leading \"New Negro\" authors including Alain Locke, Jessie Redmon Fauset, and Langston Hughes. These were the personal copies of Nellie Rathbone Bright (1898-1977), who served on the journal's 4-person editorial team. Each one is inscribed by her on the front wrapper. Other key figures were co-editor Arthur Huff Fauset (1899-1983), and artistic director Allan Randall Freelon, whose etching graces the first three covers. Gwendolyn Bennett served as guest editor of issue #2. The final issue has 3 full-page illustrations, by Smith McGlinn, Lo√Øs Mailou Jones, and James Lesesne Wells (who also did that issue's cover illustration). <br><br><br><br>Interest in Black Opals remains strong. In 2017, an event at Philadelphia's Rosenbach Library was dedicated to its influence. Not in Lomazow's American Periodicals. We trace 13 American institutions which hold scattered issues of Black Opals, but only two (the Schomburg Library and the Free Library of Philadelphia) which hold a complete run of all four issues. Additional details on the contents are available upon request."
