FOOTNOTE: "The title quote is from Malcolm X. At bottom is a quote from the Bissau-Guinean revolutionary Amílcar Cabral: \"The colonialists have a habit of telling us that when they arrived they put us into history. You are well aware that it's the contrary--when they arrived they took us out of our own history. Liberation for us is to take back our destiny and our history.” The poster is illustrated with images celebrating African culture. Other examples, including one at the University of Michigan, have a Black Liberation Press imprint in the lower right margin."
