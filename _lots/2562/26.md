FOOTNOTE: The Hutchinson Family Singers emerged from New Hampshire to become the nation's
  most popular singing group of the 1840s. Overtly political, they did much to advance
  the cause of white abolitionism. This sheet music for "Get off the Track" features
  the "Immediate Emancipation" train pulled by the Liberator locomotive. "Emancipation
  soon will bless our happy nation. Huzza! Huzza!! Huzza!!!" Every generation could
  use more pop stars like these.
