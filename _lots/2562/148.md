CROSSHEAD: "Dallas bus segregation sign."
TYPESET: "Metal and enamel sign, 7 x 12 inches, with original metal mounting holes; moderate staining and soiling."
at-a-glance: "Dallas, TX: Texlite-Dallas, circa 1936-56"
FOOTNOTE: "\"Notice: it is required by law, under penalty of fine of $5.00 to $25.00, that white and negro passengers must occupy the respective space or seats indicated by signs in this vehicle.\" Texas had long segregated their public transportation, but it was not until 1936 that the state penal code dictated that all public carriers must be segregated, as stated here. Getty Images holds two photographs showing this same sign design, taken shortly after a 1956 Supreme Court desegregation ruling. One shows a city worker removing one of these signs in compliance with the ruling, and in another, five smiling Black women are seen ignoring the sign's now obsolete instructions."
