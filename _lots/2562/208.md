FOOTNOTE: "An account of a \"school for the colored people\" opened in an old hotel downtown Quitman, GA by northern missionaries. Even as the building was prepared for students, the staff endured a steady stream of abuse from the locals, including bullets fired through the principal's window at night. The school managed to open in early October 1885. On 17 November, it was set on fire. Although located one block from the local fire department, no effort was made to save the building, only to protect the neighboring buildings from falling cinders. No lives were lost, but the staff and students fled town. In a final insult, the principal was charged with arson. <br><br><br><br>This article was later published in the January 1886 issue of The American Missionary, pages 2 to 6. OCLC lists only one other example of this leaflet printing, at Harvard."
