FOOTNOTE: "The author Zora Neale Hurston was an outspoken Republican and came out against the Brown vs. Board of Education desegregation ruling. She argued that it was undignified to beg for inclusion in white institutions, and that efforts to improve Black schools would be more fruitful. Her arguments, as published in the Richmond Times-Dispatch, were music to the ears of the white strict segregationists who called themselves the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties. They published this flier, which consisted of two clippings on Hurston's views, and their short note at the end: \"It is our sincere belief that the feeling of this noted Negro authoress is shared by millions of other fine people, both Negro and white.\" <br><br><br><br>With--two similar fliers issued by the same organization in 1955: \"Negro Editor Urges His Race to Put First Things First\" and \"A Negro Attacks Integration.\""
