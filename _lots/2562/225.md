She was still acting and had just published her memoir when she passed earlier this year at the age of 96. <br><br><br><br>This tribute was penned by Walter Leonard (1929-2015), who had launched Harvard's affirmative action program and later served as president at Fisk: \"As Jane Pittman, she moved the art of acting to new heights. . . . She has given much to us. In an age of defeat and retreat, neglect and oppression; she is a symbol of strength, an embodiment of beauty and evidence of sterling achievement.\" None others traced in OCLC, at auction, or elsewhere."
