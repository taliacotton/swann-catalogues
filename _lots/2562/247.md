at-a-glance: Atlanta, GA, 17 January 1968
FOOTNOTE: 'Any piece of oratory by Dr. King is a part of the nation''s heritage, but
  this is not just any speech. It was given at a planning meeting for the last of
  his great protest movements: the Poor People''s Campaign. The audience was a large
  group of leaders and staff of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference which
  he had founded and led for ten years as his primary vehicle for activism. Here before
  his most loyal followers, we can hear shouts of affirmation and rueful laughter
  from the audience. <br><br>The stakes were high; the Poor People''s Campaign would
  soon be publicized and launched, but the group was still debating its tactics and
  list of demands. King told the Atlanta Constitution that an "idea task force" was
  presently preparing demands for Congress, adding that "we''re trying to provide
  an alternative to the long hot summer" (17 January 1968). <br><br>King''s central
  argument was the need to reach Washington on the side of justice, without getting
  slowed down by the details: "We are moving around the right issue. It’s a simple
  thing. Jobs are income. , , , We are talking about bread now. We are talking about
  the right to eat, the right to live, this is what we''re going to Washington about.
  . . . The nation needs this. We don’t have to worry about just jobs or income. Let’s
  get to Washington. And after we get there, and stay a few days, call the peace movement
  in. . . . I don’t know what Jesus had as his demands, other than ‘Repent, for the
  Kingdom of God is at hand.’ My demand in Washington is Repent, America!"<br><br>The
  power of demonstrations, if channeled to non-violence, is discussed at length: "The
  nation needs a movement now. . . . and I say to you that many of our confusions
  are dissolved, they are distilled in demonstrations. . . . They have served the
  purpose of giving people new senses of dignity and destiny." Apparently motioning
  to SCLC staff member Lester Hankerson, a former street gang leader, he said "Lester
  wouldn’t be here today if there hadn’t been some demonstrations around Savannah,
  he’d probably be out there in jail somewhere, not for demonstrations but for other
  reasons. But Lester became a man, and a person committed to moral purposes, through
  demonstrations. The sociologists don’t write about it much, but whenever you have
  demonstrations in a community, the crime rate goes down." Demonstrations were King''s
  tool and he had clearly thought through their impact: “In dangerous moments, people
  begin to hold hands that didn''t know they could hold them. The question of black
  and white goes out in a demonstration. We will argue it philosophically, but out
  on that line, black folk and white folk get together in a strange way. And I’m saying
  many of the things we argue about, segregation or integration, will be dealt with
  in demonstrations. . . . The nation needs a movement. And the questions we argue
  about, violence and non-violence, will be dealt with in a demonstration. . . . Hope
  is the final refusal to give up. In this sense it has a medicinal quality. . . .
  As we go into these communities, we go with the hope that we can move this sick
  nation away from at least a level of its sickness."<br><br>King also uses a series
  of analogies and parables to make his points--some religious, some not. He calls
  upon the national religion of baseball by recounting a rousing walk-off victory
  by his beloved Brooklyn Dodgers, who he had rooted for since Jackie Robinson''s
  arrival in 1947. Oddly enough, his central parable is about the great 19th-century
  Norwegian violinist Ole Bull, who is said to have broken his A string just after
  the intermission of his performance. Rather than give up in despair, Bull improvised
  a transposition of the whole performance to the three remaining strings and finished
  flawlessly. You might not be able to turn a story about a long-dead Norwegian violinist
  into a powerful metaphor, but you are not Martin Luther King. He reflected upon
  the victories and stumbles of the SCLC over the past seven years: "We don''t have
  much. The people we are going to be recruiting don''t have much. Their A strings
  have broken. We in this movement have had our disappointments, we’ve had our failures,
  we’ve had our moments of agony. Our A strings are broken. We went to Albany, Georgia
  and things didn’t come out like we wanted to see them come out, and everybody said
  SCLC is finished, movement is finished, the A string broke down in Albany, but we
  transposed the composition in Birmingham and finished on three strings. Some people
  say we failed in Chicago. I haven’t concluded that, but we certainly didn’t do everything
  in Chicago that we set out to do. And I never will forget one day an agreement was
  reached, and Chicago didn’t live up to that agreement. A string broke, I look back
  over, and I wish we had gone to Cicero now, but don’t worry about these things,
  you make mistakes, in any game. If you run your football down the goal, don’t be
  upset about fumbling the ball, just try and recover it. We are going to Washington
  and we are going to transpose the composition." King apparently saw the Poor People''s
  Campaign as a way to redeem the Chicago Freedom Movement, which had ended with a
  fizzle in 1966 when some of his more radical supporters had instead wanted to march
  on the white suburb of Cicero. <br><br>King drives toward his conclusion with a
  series of rhetorical flourishes like a fireworks display: "That is a law in this
  universe: when it is dark enough, you can see the stars. There is a law in this
  universe, no lie can live forever. There is a law in this universe, truth crushed
  to earth will rise again. . . . I go away with this faith. I don’t know if I’ll
  see all of you before April, but I send you forth as Jesus said to his disciples
  as sheep amid wolves, be ye as strong and as tough as a serpent and as tender as
  a dove and we will be able to do something that will give new meaning to our own
  lives, I hope new meaning to the life of the nation. I may not see you before, but
  I''ll meet you in Washington." King never made it to Washington to see the launch
  of the campaign. <br><br>This tape has 23½ minutes of King''s speech, beginning
  in mid-sentence but apparently near the beginning of his remarks. The remarks are
  repeated twice on the tape, with the second appearance much clearer in sound. More
  extensive notes transcribed from King''s remarks are available upon request. A digital
  audio file of King''s remarks will be provided to the winning bidder. '
