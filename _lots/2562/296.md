CROSSHEAD: "\"The Jubilee,\" promoting the current touring season of the Jubilee Singers from Fisk University."
TYPESET: "4 pages, 12 x 9Â¼ inches, on one folding sheet, with local concert information overprinted in red at base of final page; missing a 2-inch chunk from lower inner corner just touching text, otherwise moderate wear."
at-a-glance: "Albion, NY: 24 March [1883] (overprinting)"
FOOTNOTE: "Includes introductions of the 12 members of the Jubilee Singers and press reports on recent performances. Their audiences had included Presidents Grant, Hayes, Garfield, and Arthur, as well as Queen Elizabeth. The most unusual endorsement comes from ex-Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, by then a quite frail invalid, who invited the singers to perform in his parlor. No other examples of this 1882-1883 edition traced, though Brown University has the 1879-80 edition."
