DESCRIPT: Masood Ali Wilbert Warren
CROSSHEAD: Archive of sketches, correspondence, and other papers.
TYPESET: '<p>Well over 1,000 items (1.6 linear feet in 3 boxes), including: more than
  920 drawings, most on loose sheets of about 12 x 9 inches executed in conté crayon,
  graphite or felt tip pen, many dated (the bulk from about 1958 to 1989), a few with
  "M.A.W." inked stamps on verso, few of them signed or captioned, plus more than
  50 letters and more than 70 photographs; some with moderate wear, a few with moderate
  dampstaining.</p><p>Warren is known primarily for his portrait busts and other sculptural
  work, but as seen in this archive, he was also a prolific sketcher. The bulk of
  the pieces in this lot are candid portrait sketches of unidentified people, usually
  alone or sometimes in pairs, many of them Black but spanning a wide range of ethnicities.
  His subjects are often depicted on park benches, strolling down sidewalks, or sitting
  at lunch counters, evoking the streets of New York in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.
  A few are arranged by subject matter, with folders devoted to musicians, nudes,
  and animals. Most of the pieces are about 12 x 9 inches; a portfolio box contains
  17 larger sketches of nudes, about 18 x 12 inches, as well as a 17 x 14 watercolor
  portrait dated 1979.</p><p>In addition to the original sketches, this lot includes
  more than 50 personal and professional letters to Warren, 1940–77, including letters
  from Congressman Charles Rangel, Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton, numerous
  letters regarding employment and commissions, and some relating to his Muslim faith.
  More than 70 photographs are included, many of them official Air Force photographs
  documenting his sculptural work, or of the artist in uniform and/or at work. Also
  included are portraits inscribed to Warren by singers Lena Horne and Kay Starr in
  1948. Two large panels with mounted photographs are proposals for large sculpture
  projects—a monument to World War Two ace pilot Thomas McGuire which was given a
  prominent place at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, and another to the lost
  submarine SSN Thresher.</p>'
