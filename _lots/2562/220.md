FOOTNOTE: "The New York Negro Ballet Company was founded late in 1956. In August 1957, they embarked on a tour of Great Britain, but their top financial backer passed away before they could continue to continental Europe; they continued to perform stateside through 1959 as Ballet Americana. Most of these photographs are professional shots of the dancers on stage; two show them posed on a steamship en route to Europe."
