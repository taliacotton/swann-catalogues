FOOTNOTE: "First edition of an early prize-winning play by an important Harlem Renaissance female writer. She was born on Nevis in the West Indies and raised in Harlem and Brooklyn. This was her third play, produced by W.E.B. Du Bois's Krigwa Players Little Negro Theatre, with sets by Aaron Douglas. It won the Samuel French Prize for \"Best Unpublished Play,\" but a dispute with Du Bois over the $200 prize money (and Spence's lack of an overt political agenda) led to the dissolution of the Krigwa Players. None traced at auction."
