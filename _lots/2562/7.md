FOOTNOTE: "A second-generation print of one of the most iconic images of slavery. After repeated beating and whippings at a Louisiana plantation, Gordon escaped from slavery and made his way to a Union camp at Baton Rouge, where he joined the army as a private. A camp photographer took a series of photographs which graphically demonstrated the brutality he had endured. The present photograph was the best known. It was engraved for the 4 July 1863 issue of Harper's Weekly, where it ran over the caption \"Gordon Under Medical Inspection.\" <br><br><br><br>This example seems to be copied from one printed by Chandler Seaver in Boston, as the original mount with double-ruled border can be seen in the photograph, above a caption repeated from the verso of Seaver's version, as seen at the National Gallery of Art: \"Copy of a photograph taken from life at Baton Rouge, La. April 2 1863.\""
