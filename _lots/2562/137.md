FOOTNOTE: "Many of the posters of this era were produced by small and short-lived operations. Hiatt Enterprises began running classified ads in the Atlanta newspapers in 1969, looking to buy gold and silver. They kept taking out the classified ads, but moved into selling wholesale posters, patches and incense in October 1970. Their distributor, 24th Century Distributors of 155 Forsyth Street in Atlanta, came to an end later in 1972. The Atlanta Constitution ran a classified ad for a 23 August 1972 bankruptcy sale at that address, selling \"clothes, desks, fixtures, 8-track tapes, and assorted merchandise.\""
