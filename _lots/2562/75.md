CROSSHEAD: "A young man raises funds for the Black Panthers, a month before Newton and Seale launched their group."
TYPESET: "Photograph, 7Â½ x 10 inches, with United Press International inked stamp and mimeograph caption label on verso; minimal wear."
at-a-glance: "Berkeley, CA, 23 September 1966"
FOOTNOTE: "A quiet sunny day on the University of California campus in Berkeley. A young man sits at a folding card table with tidy stacks of freshly printed Black Panther publications behind a sign reading \"Support the Black Panther Party!\" He is reading the 18 September issue of the early underground newspaper, the Berkeley Barb. The caption on verso presents the scene as a campus radical freak show, giving equal billing to the \"coed wearing dungarees and a turtleneck sweater.\" These are not the Black Panthers we know from other images. <br><br><br><br>Stokely Carmichael had been working with the Lowndes County Freedom Organization in Alabama, which had developed the iconic Black Panther logo to help with their voter registration drive. This young man was likely raising funds to support the Alabama project. The Black Panther name and logo were becoming popular in rallies on college campuses and other radical hotbeds, and a New York group had already adopted the name. However, not until late October 1966--a month after this photograph was taken--did Huey Newton and Bobby Seale launch a new organization in nearby Oakland, which they called the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense."
