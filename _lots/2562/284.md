FOOTNOTE: "This muster and pay roll lists the 86 enlisted men of Company D, their dates of enlistment, and other notes covering July and August of 1863. Private Kenian Williams is recorded as having died in the hospital on 30 July. A later note in red pen shows that his back pay was finally awarded to his heirs in 1890. Similarly, a soldier who had been discharged for disability was paid in 1871; many others are noted as having been given a certificate of service in 1866. Several soldiers are listed as having performed \"extra duty\" as carpenters and blacksmiths. Almost all of the soldiers signed the pay roll by mark, but sergeants Charles Taylor and Samuel Thomas and musician George W. Weeks signed their own names. The regiment was later known as the 2nd Regiment, Corps d'Afrique, and then the 74th United States Colored Troops."
