FOOTNOTE: "From the introduction: \"This collection of graphic collages has been created specifically as a memento for those who participated in the historic March on Washington for Freedom and Jobs on August 28, 1963. It depicts man's inhumanity, his cruelty to his fellow human being. This memento, we believe, will inspire us to assert man's decency and goodness through an understanding of anguish.\" The introduction is signed in facsimile by the march leaders including Martin Luther King Jr., A. Philip Randolph, James Farmer, Roy Wilkins, and Whitney M. Young Jr. <br><br><br><br>This is the most pristine example of the portfolio we have handled. It is accompanied by two additional insert cards: an uncompleted card to pledge commitment to the ideals of the March; and a card offering a parable of racial prejudice titled \"An Indian Lesson,\" produced by the \"6200 Champlain Avenue Block Club\" [Chicago]."
