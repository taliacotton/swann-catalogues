  Platonists, in the late 17th century. "The Platonists constructed a natural theology
  supporting the concept of free will, and opposing the materialism of Thomas Hobbes.
  To its members, there was no natural divide between philosophy and theology. Reason
  could, therefore, sort out rival theological and ethical claims without the violence
  that had troubled their generation.'' (see <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/cudworth/"
