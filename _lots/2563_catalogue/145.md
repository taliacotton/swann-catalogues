TYPESET: "<br><br>Leiden: Apud Joannem & Hermannum Verbeek, 1747.<br><br>First edition,
  oversized folio, engraved vignette to title, full-paged engraved dedication leaf;
  four leaf author's preface; illustrated with forty full-paged anatomical engravings
  by Jan Wandelaar (1690-1759), with typographical leaves of explanatory text accompanying
  each plate (or pair of plates) the first twenty-four images in pairs, in which the
  same subject is presented in two forms: as an outline with numbered parts; and fully
  shaded with backgrounds; bound in modern half leather and marbled paper boards,
  27 1/2 x 19 1/4 in.<br><br>Albinus and Wandelaar worked jointly on this work, which
  was largely funded by Albinus himself. For accuracy, the collaborators used grid
  scaling to produce precise images. Clara, an 18th century rhinoceros who was touring
  Europe in 1741, makes two appearances in the creative backgrounds employed by Wandelaar."
