TYPESET: "<br><br>Naples: Ignazio Russo, 1753.<br><br>First and only edition, quarto, woodcut emblem to title, illustrated with fifteen folding engravings illustrating the use of the proportional compass, and related tables; bound in contemporary parchment over stiff boards, title tooled in gilt directly on spine, very old ms. library shelf locations, 9 x 6 1/2 in.<br><br>The proportional or reduction compass is a device that facilitates the reduction, enlargement, or division of distances based on a set ratio. It has two legs, like a normal compass, but the pivot point can be adjusted by moving it along a channel cut in each leg. Once set, the change in size of a set figure can be made by consulting the needle points on the other end of the compass. A practical instrument for sculptors, craftsmen, and astronomers alike, its invention has been credited to Galileo, Hulsius, Jost BÃ¼rgi, and Fabrizio Mordente, although it was certainly used in antiquity, as one has been discovered in the charred remains of Pompeii.<br><br>Sotheran 12897; Honeyman Collection 2392."
