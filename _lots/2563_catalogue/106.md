Coignard, 1742.<QL<br>First edition, octavo, A-B8, C4, half calf, marbled paper boards, 7 1/4 x 4 1/2 in.<br><br>This catalogue advertises Cardinal Polignac's (1661-1742) great collection of ancient marble art, which included colossal, life-size, and half life-size statuary, busts, bas-reliefs, urns, columns, carved inscriptions, and other Greek and Roman antiquities. Polignac acquired these objects as he dabbled in archeology in Rome in the 1730s. The auctioneer, Coignard, states that the collection may either be sold in parts as a whole. From what this cataloguer could gather, Frederick the Great (1712-1786) purchased the collection outright."
