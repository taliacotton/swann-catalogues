  beautifully hand-colored and fascinatingly arranged compositions, engraved after
  his own drawings, were inspired by the collection of natural history specimens in
  Bayreuth belonging to the Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. Perusing
  the book, one recalls the childhood excitement of viewing samples under magnification
  for the first time. From butterfly wings, crystals, minute seashells, microscopic
  waterborne life forms, fabric, and botanical samples, to the human fingerprint,
  fleas, houseflies, and lice, all can be found in this volume, in vivid hand-color.
  Our guide to this miniature world also provides practical advice for building microscopes,
  and different ways of viewing slides and projecting images from the microscope for
  others to view.<br><br>Wellcome III 472."
