When the Japanese occupied the Shanghai Consulate in December of 1941, Helmick was taken prisoner and held for about six months before being returned to the States. After the U.S. relinquished its rights to territories in China, his position was effectively eliminated, but he returned to China in 1944 to familiarize himself with China's new legal system. He remained there, working for Standard Vacuum Oil in Shanghai until 1951. In the mid-1950s, he served as a Judge in North Africa, and ultimately retired to San Francisco."
