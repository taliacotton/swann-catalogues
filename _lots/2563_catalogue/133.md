  the most notorious forger of fine early modern bindings. He worked for a time at
  the London bookbinding firm of Zaehnsdorf’s, as well as privately for the Duke d’Aumale,
  restoring his library. By the early 1860s, then living in Brussels, it apparently
  occurred to him to try his skills against the ultimate test: attempt to pass his
  bindings off as authentic." (For more, cf. Elizabeth DeBold''s article in <i>The
  Collation</i>, "Under Cover: Forged Bindings on Display at the Folger," July 19,
