  Private collection, New York. <br><br>Published: O''Connor and Liu, Unseen Warhol,
  Cologne: Taschen, 1996, page 120 (another example illustrated); Frei and Printz,
  The Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonné of Paintings and Sculptures 1964-1969, London:
  Phaidon, 2004, vol. 2B, page 280, number 1937.12 (another example illustrated);
  Hickey, Andy Warhol "Giant" Size, London: Phaidon, 2006, page 135 (another example
  illustrated).<br><br>In 1967, the Arts Council of the Philadelphia Y.M.H.A. organized
  the exhibit "Museum of Merchandise," which aimed to explore "a philosophic approach
  to art, bridging the gap between artist and designer... to take the artist our of
  the ivory tower and put him into the control tower." Works for sale included Warhol''s
  (1928-1987) You''re In, silver Coca-Cola bottles filled with cheap "toilet water"
  perfume ("Silver Lining" by Cassell). <br><br>Though over-budget, "Museum of Merchandise,"
  May 11-28, 1967, was successful and garnered significant press coverage. Warhol''s
  You''re In was discontinued once Coca-Cola Company executives became aware of their
  bottles being re-branded under a crude pun.</p>'
