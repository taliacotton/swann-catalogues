  Gifted by the artist to Francis V. O''Connor (1937-2017), New York-based art historian,
  poet, artist and co-editor of the Jackson Pollock catalogue raisonné (published
  in 1978); gifted by bequest to the current owner.<br><br>Seliger (1926-2009) was
  an Abstract Expressionist artist, born and raised in Manhattan. He was one of the
  original generation of Abstract Expressionist artists connected with the New York
  School and was one of the youngest artists to exhibit at Peggy Guggenheim''s The
  Art of This Century Gallery, New York (the forerunner to the Betty Parsons Gallery).
  In 1943, Seliger met and befriended Jimmy Ernst the son of Max Ernst (married to
  Peggy Guggenheim at the time), and who at the age of 23 years was just a few years
  older than Seliger. Drawn into the circle of the avant-garde in New York through
  his friendship with Ernst, Seliger''s paintings attracted the attention of Howard
  Putzel who worked with Peggy Guggenheim. At 19, Seliger was included in Putzel’s
  groundbreaking exhibition "A Problem for Critics" at the 67 Gallery, New York. Also
  in 1945 he had his first solo show at the Art of This Century Gallery. Seliger showed
  his paintings there until 1947 when Guggenheim closed the gallery and returned to
  Europe (the representation of her artists was taken over by Betty Parsons). At the
  age of only twenty Seliger''s oil painting Natural History: Form within Rock, 1946,
  was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, for the permanent collection.<br><br>Seliger
  was known for his small, jewel-like paintings (unlike most artists from the New
  York School who worked in large-scale formats). He was a veteran of more than 45
  solo exhibitions at important contemporary galleries and museums. In 1950 he joined
  the Willard Gallery, New York, who represented important contemporary artists of
  the time including David Smith, Morris Graves and others. He formed close friendships
  with many of the Willard Gallery artists, including Mark Tobey, Lyonel Feininger
  and Norman Lewis. Seliger had his first museum exhibition, at the De Young Museum,
  San Francisco, in 1949. In 1986, he was the subject of a retrospective exhibition
  at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York.</p>'
