TYPESET: "Brush and ink on white wove paper mounted on board, 1967.  355x415 mm; 14x16¼ inches.  Signed and dated in ink, lower right recto.<br><br>Gifted by the artist to John F. McKim (nephew of the artist), New York; thence through descent to the current owner, private collection, New York.<br><br>From 1966-68, Guston (1913-1980) executed hundreds of drawings and vacillated between creating minimal compositions he called \"pure\" drawings and object-based compositions. It was a time of reflection and internal conflict for Guston, who noted that: \"I remember days of doing \"pure\" drawings immediately followed by days of doing the other—drawings of objects. It wasn't a transition in the way it was in 1948, when one feeling was fading away and a new one had not yet been born. It was two equally powerful impulses at loggerheads . . . I have never experienced such a fierce confrontation. Perhaps when you see the drawings of '66, '67, '68, '69—or the photos, you will see what I mean. For this reason I think of this period as of paramount importance.\" (see The Drawings of Philip Guston, The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1988, page 29)."
