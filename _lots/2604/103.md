TYPESET: "Oil and watercolor on paper mounted to board, 1963.  455x557 mm; 18x22 inches.  Signed and dated in oil, lower right recto.  <br><br>Provenance: Private collection, Yorktown, New York.<br><br>Goldfarb was a contemporary of the New York School, attending the Art Students League in 1949 where she met Jackson Pollock (1912-1956).  Goldfarb did not stay in New York for long after her studies.  She continued to paint in the Abstract Expressionist style into the 1960s.  In 1954, she moved to Paris, where she forged her career as an abstract artist with an unshakable identity.  Goldfarb embraced the Parisian art scene and was welcomed into the same circles as Man Ray (1890-1976) and other American ex-pats.  Distance from New York perhaps led her to develop her unique style which blended French pointillism, sophisticated color theory, and her roots in abstraction."
