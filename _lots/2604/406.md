Signed in oil, upper right recto.<br><br>Provenance: Fischbach Gallery, New York, with the label on the frame back.<br><br>Wilson (1924-2015) is known for her expressionist landscapes that often depict expansive skies in harmonic colors.  She was born in Iowa, and her childhood living on a farm greatly influenced her interest in natural elements, especially the expanse of the sky as it related to the flat plains of the farm where she grew up.  She has said, \"I used to roam around a lot by myself as a child, and when I think of a landscape, I think of the great weight of the sky and how it rests on the earth.\"  She studied painting and art history at the University of Iowa before moving to New York and becoming involved with the New York school of artists, exhibiting at Tanager Gallery and Stable Gallery as well as co-founding the Hansa Gallery, an artists' cooperative, before joining the Tibor de Nagy gallery.  During her long career, she continued to depict the luminous aspects of the sky, sea and land.  Her work is included in the permanent collections of The Museum of Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art , and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among others."
