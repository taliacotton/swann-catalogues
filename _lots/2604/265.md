Additionally 13 trial proofs were printed at the Pratt Graphic Art Center, New York (these inscribed \"NYC\").  The regular edition was printed by Atelier Georges Lablanc, Paris and published by Galleria Schwarz, Milan to be included in International Anthology of Contemporary Engraving: The International Avant-Garde: America Discovered, Volume 5.  The plate used for this print was originally given to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago by the R.R. Donnelly Company, printers of Life magazine.  Indiana discovered the plate while visiting Berdich at the school and decided to use it in his contribution to the Avant-garde portfolio.  Sheehan 29."
