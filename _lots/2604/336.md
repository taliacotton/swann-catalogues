  magazine editor, publisher, painter, photographer and sculptor.  He was born into
  a Jewish family in Kyiv, and when his father took a post advising the Soviet government,
  the family moved to Moscow.  Following difficulties in Moscow, his father secured
  permission from Lenin and the Politburo to take his son to London in 1921.  Liberman
  started work in the publishing industry in Paris during the 1930s.  After emigrating
  to New York in 1941, he began working for Condé Nast Publications, rising to the
  position of editorial director, which he held from 1962 to 1994.<br><br>Only in
  the 1950s did Liberman take up painting and, later, metal sculpture.  His highly
  recognizable sculptures are assembled from industrial objects, often painted in
  uniform bright colors or highly polished like the current work.  His monumental
  sculpture The Way,1972-80, made of eighteen salvaged steel oil tanks, is a signature
  work of Laumeier Sculpture Park, and a major landmark of St. Louis, Missouri.
