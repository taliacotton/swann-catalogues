Signed and dated in ink, verso.<br><br>Provenance: Acquired from Rosa Esman Gallery, New York by the current owner, private collection, New Milford, Connecticut.<br><br>Sander (1906-1975) was born and raised in and around New York City and was first exposed to art during childhood visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He studied architecture in high school and enrolled in New York University in 1924, but dropped out to become an artist. He attended the Art Students League in 1928-30 and had an independent study with Alexander Archipenko. He worked in an abstract style; however it wasn't until the late 1950s that he had refined it to his most recognized styleâ€”geometric compositions of flat, complementary colors intersected with vertical and horizontal lines. He co-founded \"The Club\" in 1949, a discussion group for artists, including Willem de Kooning, Conrad Marca-Relli and Ad Reinhardt. In 1951 he participated in the famous \"Ninth Street Show\", which presented The New York School of abstract artists to the public."
