He completed his artistic training at London University and the Central School for Art, where he received a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1953.  Stroud joined a group of young British abstract artists, including Victor Passmore.  During ventures to Paris, through Peggy Guggenheim, he met the artist Jean Helion, whose influence was important in solidifying Stroud's commitment to abstraction.  Ben Nicholson was also a major influence during this period.<br><br>During the early 1960s, Stroud taught at the Maidstone College of Art, Kent, while exhibiting frequently with prominent galleries in London, including  his first solo show at the Institute for Contemporary Art in 1961 and with landmark group shows including \"Dimensions,\" 1959, and \"Situation,\" 1960, at the RBA Gallery.  Following his success in England, Stroud became the chairperson of the fine arts department at Bennington College, Vermont, and his work was included in the Museum of Modern Art's, New York, groundbreaking1965 exhibition, \"The Responsive Eye.\"  At Bennington, Stroud was influenced by the sculptor Tony Smith, and exhibitions of work by Barnett Newman and Agnes Martin.  It was also during this time that he began his friendship with fellow artist Ad Reinhardt.
