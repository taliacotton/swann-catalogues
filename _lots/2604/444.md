TYPESET: "Two painted wood sculptures, each on a lacquered wood base, circa 2006.  Each 590x143x253 mm; 23¼x5⅝x10 inches.   From the series Naturaleza interior I.<br><br>Barreda (born 1954) studied printmaking at the School of Visual Arts in Rio de Janeiro and under artist Ruth Leaf in New York before specializing in sculpture at The Sculpture Center in New York.  She set up an engraving workshop, El Taller, in Lima, Peru in the 1980s, where she still operates the Fundación Centro El Taller, to instruct graphic artists and to fund and promote Peruvian art.  In her sculptural works, Barreda draws from a multitude of sources and inspirations, including pre-Columbian traditions, mythology, spirtualism, and ecology.  In her series Naturaleza interior, Barreda references her own internal dialogue with nature, especially flowers.  By mimicking the undulating curves as well as the reproductive structures of the flower, the series alludes to gender and sexuality."
