TYPESET: 'Painted wood sculpture, circa 1958  750x190x205 mm; 29½x7⅞x7½ inches.  Incised
  with red painted initials on the underside.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection,
  London.<br><br>Possibly exhibited, "Louise Nevelson: First London Exhibition," Hanover
  Gallery, London, 1963.<br><br><br><br>While best known for her monochromatic wooden
  assemblages, such as the current work, the Russian Empire emigré Nevelson (1899-1988),
  born in Pereiaslav near Kyiv, was also a painter and printmaker.  She emigrated
  with her family to the Untited States in 1905 and she began her career studying
  at the Art Students League in New York in 1929, returning to Europe in 1931.  While
  in Europe, Nevelson visited France and Italy and briefly studied with Hans Hofmann
  in Munich. Returning to New York in 1932, she continued her studies with Hans Hoffman
  who was a visiting instructor at the Art Students League.  She began exhibiting
  her work in group exhibitions throughout the 1930s, but also relied on teaching
  classes for income, even being employed by the WPA to teach mural painting to a
  Boys and Girls Club in Brooklyn.<br><br>By the 1940s, Nevelson dedicated herself
  almost exclusively to sculpture; for several years the impoverished Nevelson and
  her son collected firewood to burn in order to keep warm: these served as the starting
  point for the sculptures that would make her famous.  In 1958, Nevelson had a career
  turning point, when The Museum of Modern Art, New York, purchased one of her wooden
  wall sculptures and in the following year she was chosen to exhibit her work in
  The MOMA''s Sixteen Americans exhibition.  Having achieved financial security and
  critical and commerical success, by the 1960s Nevelson was able to expand her repertoire,
  including work on monumental outdoor sculptures.  She also made a return to lithography
  and etching with which she experimented with throughout the 1930s.<br><br>Joyce
  Pomeroy Schwartz, a friend of Nevelson''s and a former assistant at Pace Gallery,
  New York, recalled that Nevelson, "Was the most organized person.  All of the garbage
  she picked up was totally organized.  It was not that she was a junk collector—she
  collected junk but as objects that were potentially art.  In her studio she had
  all the different sized wood sorted in barrels.  And when you saw this and the dishes
  in her closets you realized that this woman was a compulsive neurotic artist."'
