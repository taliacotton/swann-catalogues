Published by the Committee Against the War in Vietnam.<br><br>Johns (born 1930) created this image to commemorate the anti-war Moratorium Marches that occurred throughout the United States in the fall of 1969.  Johns subverted the image of the American flag, combining an Agent Orange-esque hue and a sickly shade of green along with a bullet hole in order to draw attention to the violence and horror the United States had wrought upon Vietnam since the start of the war more than a decade earlier.
