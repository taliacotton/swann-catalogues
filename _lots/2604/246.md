  began work on the same-titled screenprint series on stainless steel, revisiting
  his homage to the Impressionist artist Claude Monet which he started in the late
  1960s with his Cathedral and Haystacks series.  Additionally, Frederic Tuten, writer
  and friend of the artist, said of the project "One might see this strategy as the
  culmination of Lichtenstein's long meditations on reflections, which began in the
  earliest of his Pop Art work," (see Corlett 261-66).
