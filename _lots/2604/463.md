A very good impression with vibrant colors.<br><br>According to Brian Donnelly (born 1974), the artist known professionally as Kaws, the Urge color screenprints were made after paintings he created: \"In March 2020, my wife and I had Covid-19. I was in bed for three weeks.  There was all this uncertainty and news about not touching your face, not touching anything. I started doing drawings of CHUM with hands all over his face--touching and contaminating.  It's meant to be humorous but at the same time, it's very stressful.  As soon as I got out [of isolation], I turned the drawings into a series of ten paintings, which is hung as a grid in the exhibition.\""
