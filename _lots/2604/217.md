  collection, New Jersey.<br><br>Probst (1913-1980) was an East Village, New York
  mainstay during the ascent of Abstract Expressionism, a bohemian artist whose friends
  included Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline.  Probst''s work pursued
  two distinct paths, one was figurative expressionism in which he portrayed Biblical
  and spiritual themes, albeit not subject driven, the other was purely non-objective.  The
  latter evidently had some influence on Kline, their relationship is repeatedly noted
  by Probst in his extensive private journal, discovered after his death, and evidenced
  by Kline''s seminal Abstract Expressionist oil painting, Probst I, 1960, now in
  the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.'
