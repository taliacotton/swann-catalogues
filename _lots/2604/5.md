  to Francis V. O''Connor (1937-2017), New York-based art historian, poet, artist
  and co-editor of the Jackson Pollock catalogue raisonné (published in 1978); gifted
  by bequest to the current owner.<br><br>Published: Francis V. O''Connor and Eugene
  Victor Thaw, Jackson Pollock: a Catalogue Raisonné of Paintings, Drawings, and Other
  Works, 1978, volume 4, number 1089. <br><br>By 1950, Pollock (1912-1956) was lionized
  by many, including the gallerist Betty Parsons and art critic Clement Greenberg,
  as the leader of the Abstract Expressionists. An exhibition in the same year at
  the Betty Parsons Gallery proved such: featuring his renowned "drip" paintings Autumn
  Rhythm and One, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Museum of Modern Art,
  New York, respectively. But in 1951, Parsons exhibited Pollock''s newest work, a
  series of paintings devoid of color, completed exclusively in black enamel on untreated
  canvas. His seeming turn from abstract to figurative and "drip" painting to hands-on
  drawing baffled many in the art world and to some signaled his decline. Pollock
  reproduced designs for six of the black enamel paintings in screenprint to coincide
  with the exhibition. O''Connor/Thaw P 26. <br><br>With—JACKSON POLLOCK (after),
