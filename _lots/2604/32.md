Printed by Fred Genis, Hollander's Workshop, Inc., New York, with the blind stamp lower left.  Published by Knoedler, New York, with the blind stamp lower right.  A superb, richly-inked impression of this large, scarce lithograph.<br><br>This is the first lithograph that de Kooning (1904-1997) made with the renowned lithographic printer Irwin Hollander, who had trained at Tamarind Lithography Workshop in California and then opened a studio on East 10th Street in New York in 1964. <br><br>According to Hollander, \"It was not until [de Kooning] returned from his trip to Japan that he responded to do a body of lithographs.  Perhaps the seeing and feeling of calligraphy, sumi brush painting and Zen inspired him sufficiently to do prints.  Whatever, the results were beautiful . . . We worked for a year together in 1970 and 1971, proofing 38 images, of which 24 were editioned.\"  Graham 5."
