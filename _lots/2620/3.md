DESCRIPT: MARTIN SCHONGAUER
CROSSHEAD: The Crucifixion.
TYPESET: 'Engraving, circa 1480.  196x153 mm; 7¾x6¼ inches.  Gothic letter P with
  a flower watermark.  With narrow margins outside the border line.  A brilliant,
  richly-inked impression of this exceedingly scarce engraving, with very strong contrasts
  and no sign of wear, consistent with his earliest impressions of this subject.<br><br>Working
  in Colmar, once a part of southwestern Germany that is now Alsatian France, Schongauer
  (1430-1491) was among the earliest known northern artists to fully utilize the craft
  of engraving.  Many of his prints, like his few known paintings, reveal an affinity
  with the work of early Netherlandish artists such as Jan van Eyck, Roger van der
  Weyden and Dirk Bouts. Schongauer imitated the monumentality associated with the
  altar paintings of these celebrated Netherlandish artists.<br><br>Schongauer''s
  exquisitely engraved images were circulated widely throughout Europe.  The sheer
  number of engraved copies of Schongauer''s prints, made by other artists during
  his lifetime, attests to his popularity and the significant demand for his work
  in the late 15th/early 16th century (Schongauer made approximately 115 engravings
  of different subjects, of which there are an equivalent number of different copies
  made by other artists during the late 15th century alone.  One of Schongauer''s
  best known engravings, The Death of the Virgin, early 1470s, was copied in at least
  seven different prints by the early 16th century).  Most importantly, he was one
  of the first printmakers who developed an individual style and whose engravings
  helped to stimulate an interest in collecting prints hitherto unseen in northern
  Europe.<br><br>Schongauer''s work paved the way for the success of subsequent printmakers
  and was profoundly influential to the generation of engravers who proceeded him,
  most notably Albrecht Dürer (see lots 7-11 and 25-48). In 1492, the 21-year-old
  prodigious Dürer intended on training with Schongauer, but arrived at the master
  engraver''s workshop just months after his death.  Dürer went on to emulate Schongauer
  by incising deep engraved lines in his plates to extend their printing life, thereby
  increasing their commercial viability, and ultimately surpassed Schongauer''s appeal
  and popularity.<br><br>Provenance: Kupferstichkabinett, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin,
