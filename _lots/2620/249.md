DESCRIPT: "ÉDOUARD MANET"
CROSSHEAD: "Au Prado II."
TYPESET: "Aquatint and etching printed in black on cream laid Japan paper, 1863-67.  222x155 mm; 8¾x6⅛ inches, full margins.  Second state (of 2).  The Porcaboeuf edition of approximately only 12, aside from the Manet edition of only several proofs.  A superb, richly-inked impression of this extremely scarce etching.<br><br>We have found fewer than 12 other impressions at auction in the past 30 years.<br><br>Harris notes that the 1863 Manet edition consisted of, \"An edition of between 5 and 28 sets of 15 etchings, printed on Chine paper for friends and patrons of the artist . . . Later sets of the edition might have included State I of Au Prado II, which is known in proofs on Chine.\"  As this subject was not originally included in the 1863 Manet edition, it seems likely that most, if not all, of the impressions to have appeared at auction over the past 30 years are from the Porcaboeuf edition.  Guérin 46; Harris 45."
