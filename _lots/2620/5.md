A very good impression of this extremely scarce, early engraving.<br><br>According to Shestack, Meckenem's Christ before Pilate is, \"An obvious various on the composition invented by [Martin] Schongauer.  Meckenem depicts the judgment hall of Pilate.  Christ is led in at the right, as Pilate washes his hands to declare his innocence (Matthew 27:24).  In the left background, the cross is already being prepared, while at the right, Judas tries to return the bag of silver to the elders.  The figure in the foreground who leads Christ by a rope and grasps Him by the collar appears to be derived ultimately from the executioner in the right wing of Roger van der Weyden's St. John Altarpiece,\" (Fifteenth Century Engravings of Northern Europe, Washington, D.C., 1967, number 188).
