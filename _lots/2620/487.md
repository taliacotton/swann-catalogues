TYPESET: "Lithograph, 1961. 380x300 mm; 15x11Â¾ inches, full margins. Signed and numbered \"No. 97/103 III\" in pencil, lower left. A superb, evenly-printed impression with very strong contrasts.<br><br>Bools notes that Waterfall is based on Penrose's triangle, an impossible object, an optical illusion consisting of an object which can be depicted in a perspective drawing, but cannot exist as a solid object.  \"Three bars at right angles to each other seem to form a spatial object.  At the corners nothing is wrong, but going from one corner to another, you notice that there is something wrong with the connection.  In this picture Escher used a combination of three of these forms.  The water continues to flow forever!\"  Bool 439."
