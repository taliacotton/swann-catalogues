DESCRIPT: MAURITS C. ESCHER
CROSSHEAD: Bond of Union.
TYPESET: Lithograph, 1956. 254x338 mm; 10x13⅜ inches, full margins. Signed and numbered
  "No. 42/52 II" in pencil, lower left. A superb, richly-inked impression with strong
  contrasts.<br><br>According to Xu, "The built-up tension within the couple confused
  and frustrated Escher.  In 1956, he created the lithograph, Bond of Union, possibly
  as a way to express the complex feelings of his relationship.<br><br>In the print,
  the heads of Escher and Jetta [his wife] are represented and broken up into one
  connected strap.  The two heads are hovering in the void, surrounded by floating
  bubble-like globes.  The facial expression is pensive, almost sad.  It looks as
  if although the two figures are connected and inseparable, as their personalities
  are disintegrating and getting dissolved into the void.  In a 1968 interview, Escher
  claimed this piece to be merely an experiment to show the concept of endlessness
  and a reaction to sculpture.  However, he also wrote about this print, 'Like an
  endless bond, even their foreheads are woven together, they form an inseparable
  entity. Whether these two are glad to be bound as a family together, I cannot tell.
  It is a perilous undertaking, and they look a little sad.'<br><br>This is one of
  the rare portraits Escher made after World War II.  However, this piece is significantly
  different from his portraits of himself and of Jetta made more than thirty years
  earlier.  The same faces now appear reserved and indifferent.  The figures are facing
  towards each other but there is no shared eye contact, almost as if the couple is
  avoiding each other.  Escher’s facial expression, contrary to his confident look
  shown in the early self-portrait, seems troubled and tired," (The Hidden Emotions
  in M.C. Escher’s Artwork, Stockbridge, 2021).  Bool 409.
