A very good impression of this extremely scarce engraving.<br><br>Ladenspelder (1512-circa 1575) was a German printmaker active in Essen who is best known as a meticulous copyist (though this engraving and the series of which is part are of his own invention).  He engraved a complete set of Tarocchi cards, known as the E Series of Mantegna Tarocchi, which is still among the earliest known extant sets of these scarce Italian Renaissance cards, and also produced numerous skillful engravings after Albrecht Dürer's (1471-1528) master prints.  Bartsch 13."
