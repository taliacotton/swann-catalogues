  "Paul Gauguin: Artist of Myth and Dream," Complesso del Vittoriano, Rome, October
  2007- February 2008, number 121 (illustrated).<br><br>The current work was created
  by Gauguin''s (1848-1903) own technique which he called "printed drawings" in which
  he coated a sheet of paper with ink (manipulated by keeping it wet or allowing it
  to dry), laid an uninked sheet on top of it, then drew on the top second sheet,
  causing the back of the sheet to be pressed into the ink where marks were made.  Gauguin
  considered the inked image to be the artwork, and not the original drawing. As in
  the current work, he made additions in pencil to the inked work.'
