Published by Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris.  A very good impression with strong colors.<br><br>An avid sailor, Signac (1863-1935) started traveling by a small boat he owned in 1892 into the early 1900s to many of the ports of France, to the Netherlands and around the Mediterranean as far as Constantinople.  He made numerous watercolor studies and oils of these ports, notably St. Tropez, where he docked his boat, and La Rochelle, a port in southwestern France, all in his characteristic pointillist style.  His most famous oil of La Rochelle, done in 1921 and similar to this color aquatint, is now in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris.  Ginestet/Pouillon 644."
