TYPESET: "Color lithograph, 1964. 640x993 mm; 25¼x39⅛ inches, full margins.   The deluxe edition, before letters.   Signed and numbered 50/200 in pencil, lower right.  Printed by Mourlot, Paris. Published by the French Tourist Bureau, Paris. A superb impression of this large, important lithograph with vibrant colors.<br><br>Chagall's (1887-1985) exceptional career as a lithographer was greatly facilitated by his ongoing artistic collaboration with the master-printer Charles Sorlier of the Atelier Mourlot, Paris. Though Chagall made lithographs as early as the 1920s, his lithographic work blossomed from the 1950s onward, under the guidance of Sorlier. Sorlier became so familiar with Chagall's work (and Chagall relied on Sorlier's judgment to such an extent) that Sorlier created a number of prints in a style \"after\" Chagall, as interpretive designs of Chagall's original paintings and gouaches.  Sorlier 96."
