DESCRIPT: "REMBRANDT VAN RIJN"
CROSSHEAD: "Self Portrait in a Cap and Scarf with the Face Dark: Bust."
TYPESET: "Etching, 1633.  132x103 mm; 5¼x4 inches, narrow margins.  Biörklund's third state (of 3); Usticke's fourth state (of 5); New Hollstein's fourth state (of 5), before the extensive reworking of the face.  A very good, dark and well-inked impression.<br><br>Rembrandt (1606-1669) etched some 30 self-portraits, with 27 singular images of himself and several others of himself in different guises or grouped with other portrait studies.  This self-portrait, created at the age of 27, just two years after he had moved to Amsterdam from Leyden to begin to establish himself as a successful independent artist, and months before he married Saskia van Uylenburgh, is among Rembrandt's most introspective self-renderings.  The dark shading covering much of his face (which rapidly disappears in later impressions), the deep-set eyes and his quiet, hunched pose lend an almost shy, reserved appearance, which is markedly different from the proud, expressive, frontal poses of his self-portraits he made from the mid-to-late-1630s.  Bartsch 17; Biörklund 33-G; Hollstein (White and Boon) 17; New Hollstein 120."
