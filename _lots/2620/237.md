CROSSHEAD: The Circle of Thieves.
TYPESET: Engraving and drypoint on Chine collé, 1827.  275x355 mm; 10⅞x14 inches,
  full margins.  Proof, before letters.  From Illustrations to Dante's Divine Comedy.  A
  very good, early impression of this extremely scarce proof.<br><br>In 1824, Blake’s
  (1757-1827) friend the artist John Linnell, commissioned him to make a series of
  illustrations based on Dante’s Divine Comedy.  Blake was then in his late sixties
  and infirm.  A contemporary account informs us that he designed 100 watercolors
  of this subject "During a fortnight’s illness in bed."  The 102 designs he created
  were left at Blake's death in 1827 in various stages of completion, ranging from
  pencil sketches to highly finished watercolors.  Most show an expressive freedom
  in the handling of color washes far greater than Blake's earlier watercolors.  In
  1826, Blake began to engrave large plates based on seven of the designs, the current
  engraving is one; these were also left incomplete at his death.  Bindman 650.
