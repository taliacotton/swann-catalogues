TYPESET: "Mezzotint and engraving printed in dark brownish black, circa 1817-18.  220x298 mm; 8¾x11¾ inches, full margins.  First state (of 6).  From Liber Studiorum.  A superb, richly-inked impression.<br><br>Mer de Glace, Valley of Chamonix, Savoy is part of a series of 81 mezzotints created by Turner (1775-1851) and other printmakers, after his oils, that have come to be known as the Liber Studiorum.  These mezzotints are based on original watercolors by Turner, which are in turn derived from his paintings, essentially a visual catalogue raisonné of all his works.  It's considered that Turner approved of the mezzotint process as it simulated the appearance of watercolor on moist paper, which was among his preferred techniques and, in recognition of their commercial viability.  The 1820 introduction of steel mezzotint plates (as opposed to copper, which produced very limited quality impressions before the plate wore down and required reworking) may have prompted him to issue these prints.<br><br>The Liber Studiorum series was produced primarily by Charles Turner and other engravers under the direction of J.M.W. Turner, with Turner himself working on 11 of the plates (including this one).  Turner also produced the 12 additional plates which comprise the Little Liber Studiorum, a series of prints that was a sequel to the Liber Studiorum. The Liber Studiorum encompassed the entire œuvre of Turner's work by mixing historical, pastoral, architectural and landscape scenes, while the Little Liber Studiorum presents ethereal atmospheric landscapes, representative of the iconic paintings for which he is now famous.
