A very good impression of this exceedingly scarce, early engraving.<br><br>We have not found another impression at auction in the past 30 years.<br><br>Little is known about Olmütz (active circa 1481-1497), who is thought to have been principally active as a goldsmith in Central Europe.  He is best known for his printed œuvre, which includes mostly engravings after the most important masters of his day, including Martin Schongauer and the young Albrecht Dürer.   This engraving of St. Christopher, holding a wooden staff and transporting the Christ child across a river, is based on Schongauer's same-titled engraving from around 1475-80 (Lehrs 56)."
