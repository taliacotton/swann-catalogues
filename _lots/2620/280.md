DESCRIPT: "PAUL GAUGUIN"
CROSSHEAD: "Portrait de Stéphane Mallarmé."
TYPESET: "Etching and drypoint printed in dark brown on thin laid paper, 1891.  183x145 mm; 7¼x6⅝ inches, wide margins.  Third state (of 3), after cancellation.  A superb, richly-inked and dark impression with the cancellation lines barely visible.<br><br>According to the Yale University Art Gallery, which holds another impression of this subject, this etching by Gauguin (1848-1903), \"Depicts the Symbolist poet Stéphane Mallarmé, translator of Edgar Allan Poe’s The Raven.  The portrait was made in 1891, nearly two decades after Mallarmé’s first publication of Poe translations.  Nevertheless, Mallarmé’s continued association with The Raven--indeed, almost an implied merging of his identity with that of the narrator of the poem--is made evident by the presence of the bird ominously looming over the poet’s head.
