CROSSHEAD: "Coat-of-Arms with a Lion and a Cock."
TYPESET: "Engraving, circa 1503. 185x120 mm; 7¼x4¾ inches, thread margins.  A very good, dark, richly-inked Meder b-c impression with strong contrasts, with the delicate horizontal scratches lower left still distinct (Meder calls for these scratches in his \"a\" impressions) and with no sign of wear, consistent with the earliest impressions of this engraving. <br><br>Dürer's (1471-1528) first engraved coat-of-arms; he made one other in addition to several woodcuts like this subject (see the following lot).  This arms was likely not intended for a specific family, but rather a creation of pure fantasy by Dürer; the elaborate foliage and additional details allowing him to display his virtuoso engraving skills.  Bartsch 100; Meder 97."
