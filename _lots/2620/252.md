TYPESET: "Soft-ground etching, 1890.  220x135 mm; 8⅝x5⅜ inches, full margins.  With the artist's signature ink stamp (Lugt 2137a, lower right recto).  A superb, richly-inked impression with strong contrasts and crisp, partially inky plate edges.<br><br>This etching is based on Renoir's (1841-1919) oil painting La Danse à Bougival, 1883, now in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.  There is much discussion over who modeled for the painting's figures.  The prevailing opinion is that it depicts two of Renoir's friends, Suzanne Valadon and Paul Lhote.  Valadon (1865-1938) is more commonly agreed on as one of the models.  Originally a trapeze artist, she became an artist's model after an injury ended her performing career; however, she is best remembered as a successful painter herself and the mother of painter Maurice Utrillo (1883-1955).  Delteil 2."
