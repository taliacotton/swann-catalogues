TYPESET: "Etching, 1638-40.  403x287 mm; 16x11Â½ inches.  Second state (of 2).  Trimmed on the plate mark and along the arched upper edge of the image.  A superb, richly-inked and early impression of this extremely scarce etching.<br><br>Bol (1616-1680) was born in Dordrecht and was first an apprentice of Jacob Cuyp before moving to Amsterdam and continuing his training with Rembrandt van Rijn.  Both Bol and Rembrandt, who made an etching of this subject later in his career (1655), were certainly aware of the oil painting of Abraham's scarifice by Pieter Lastman, Rembrandt's mentor, from 1635.  They both drew from the melodramatic treatment of the subject in the painting--Abraham with knife in hand intecepted by the angel just prior to sacrificing his son Isaac.  Hollstein 1."
