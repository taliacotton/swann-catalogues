DESCRIPT: "REMBRANDT VAN RIJN"
CROSSHEAD: "Jupiter and Antiope: Smaller Plate."
TYPESET: "Etching and engraving, circa 1631. 85x113 mm; 3⅜x4½ inches, thread margins. Biörklund's second state (of 2); Usticke's second state (e) (of 2); New Hollstein's second state (of 2).  A very good impression of this extremely scarce etching, with some burr under the left breast and with strong contrasts.<br><br>This is the smaller and earlier version of Rembrandt's (1606-1669) two treatments of this subject, made at the beginning of his printmaking career.  The larger and second version dates from 1659, toward the end of Rembrandt's illustrious career (Bartsch 203).  Both versions almost certainly derive from Annibale Carracci's Jupiter and Antiope, engraving, 1592 (Bartsch 17).  Bartsch 204; Biörklund 31-6; Hollstein (White and Boon) 204; New Hollstein 78."
