TYPESET: "Etching, circa 1647-51.  302x205 mm; 12x8⅛ inches, thread margins.  A superb, dark, richly-inked and early impression.<br><br>Castiglione (1609-1664) was among the most original graphic artists of the 17th century, exchanging prints and ideas with his contemporary Rembrandt van Rijn, among others, as well as being one of the first artists to experiment significantly with the monotype technique.  The ambitious composition of The Bodies of Saints Peter and Paul Hidden in the Catacomb reflects the influence of Rembrandt’s luminous compositions in which Christian tales are transformed into something metaphysical.  The subject derives from the Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voraigne, which suggests that the saints’ bodies were cast into a well near the clandestine catacomb vault, seen here in Castiglione’s dramatic rendering.  The artist often etched such erudite subjects to advertise his art and prowess as a painter-philosopher to the literati in Rome and those on the grand tour.<br><br>Provenance: Johann Andreas Boerner, Nuremberg, with his name and inscription in ink verso (Lugt 270).  Bartsch 14; Percy 21."
