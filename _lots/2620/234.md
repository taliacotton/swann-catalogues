DESCRIPT: "FRANCISCO JOSÉ DE GOYA"
CROSSHEAD: "A group of 6 etchings with aquatint and drypoint executed in Bordeaux between 1824 and 1828."
TYPESET: "Each on ivory wove paper, with an additional suite of the 6 etchings with aquatint on ivory wove paper (12 total), 1824-28 (printed later).  Each approximately 190x120 mm; 7½x4¾ inches, full margins.  Each in the final state.  Each an edition of 150.  Each printed by Emiliano Sorini, 1971.<br><br>Among these extremely scarce subjects, which are among the last printed works created by Goya (1746-1828) only a handful of prints are known in lifetime impressions (Harris 32 and 34).  According to Harris, a very small posthumous edition on heavy laid paper was printed at the Calcografía, Madrid, in 1859 for John Savile Lumley.  Subsequently, 3 impressions of each subject were made for the dealers Colnaghi, London, when they acquired the plates in 1926.<br><br>The plates were then acquired by the American collector Philip Hofer, who had Sorini print this edition in 1971 (as well as a smaller edition of 7 printed by Russell T. Limbach, Middletown, Connecticut, in 1960).  Delteil 25-29; Harris 30-34 (Harris describes the 6th print in his footnote for number 34, but like Delteil does not give the print a separate number in his catalogue)."
