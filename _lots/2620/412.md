TYPESET: "Lithograph printed in brown on cream wove paper, 1918.  264x302 mm; 10⅜x11⅞ inches, wide margins.  Edition of 125.  Printed by Albert Berger, Vienna.  Published by Avalun Verlag, Vienna.  A very good impression of this scarce lithograph. <br><br>Albert Paris von Gütersloh (1887-1973) was an Austrian artist, actor, and producer, and friend of Schiele (1890-1918).  Gütersloh wrote the first study of Schiele's art in 1911 and became the subject of several of Schiele's portraits. <br><br>This lithograph was commissioned by the Gesellschaft für vervielfältigende Kunst on March 6, 1918, though it was rejected on April 27 in favor of Mädchen (see Kallir 17).  The few Bildnis Paris von Gütersloh impressions sold were stamped with the artist's name and date and numbered.  Eighty impressions of the 125 edition were included in the portfolio Das Graphische Werk von Egon Schiele, published by Rikola Verlag, Vienna, in 1922 and bear the artist's signature stamp.  Unsold lithographs and impressions not included in the portfolios, like the current work were left unstamped and sold individually.  Kallir 16."
