A superb, dark and well-inked impression with strong contrasts.<br><br>According to Bool, \"After Escher had said goodbye to the south [Italy], his work took a direction that was eventually to lead to his becoming famous.  From now on he was no longer concerned with expressing his observations--or only rarely--but rather with the construction of the images in his own mind.  These images dealt with the regular division of the plane, limitless space, rings and spirals in space, mirror images, inversion, polyhedrons, relativities, the conflict between the flat and the spatial, and impossible constructions.\"  Bool 331."
