Signed, titled and inscribed \"100 proofs\" in pencil, lower right.  A superb, dark impression with strong contrasts.<br><br>In his diary, Sloan (1871-1951) wrote, \"The subject of this plate is one which I have had in mind—night, the roofs back of us—a girl in deshabille at a window and a man on the roof smoking his pipe.\"  It seems that he struggled with the execution of this idea, however; at various points he refers to this plate as \"a pretty bad snarl,\" and \"a mess of line.\"  After roughly two years of work, he finally deemed the plate fit for publishing.  Morse 152."
