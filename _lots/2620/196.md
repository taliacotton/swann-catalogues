Strasburg Lily watermark (Ash/Fletcher 36, which they cite on impressions of this subject at the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam; Hinterding cites various second state impressions with similar or identical watermarks, dating from the 1640s and 1650s).   Trimmed on or just inside the plate mark.  A very good, early, evenly-printed impression of this large etching with strong contrasts and little to no sign of wear.  Bartsch 99; Biörklund 39-A; Hollstein (White and Boon) 99; New Hollstein 173."
