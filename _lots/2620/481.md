DESCRIPT: "MAURITS C. ESCHER"
CROSSHEAD: "Puddle."
TYPESET: "Color woodcut printed in green, brown and black on thin, cream laid Japan paper, 1952. 240x319 mm; 9½x12½ inches, wide margins.  Signed and inscribed \"eigendruck\" in pencil, lower margin.  A superb impression with strong colors.<br><br>Puddle is a realistic depiction of a simple image that portrays two perspectives at once.  It depicts an unpaved road with a large pool of water in the middle of it at twilight.  Turning the print upside-down and focusing strictly on the reflection in the water, it becomes a depiction of a forest with a full moon overhead.  The road is soft and muddy and in it there are two distinctly different sets of tire tracks, two sets of footprints going in opposite directions and two bicycle tracks.  Also in the image, Escher has thus captured three elements: water, sky and earth.  Bool 378."
