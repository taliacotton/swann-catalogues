A superb impression of this very scarce print, with fresh, strong colors.<br><br>Nature morte devant une Fenêtre à St. Raphael is based on a gouache painting from a series of works Picasso (1881-1973) made during a trip with his then new wife, the Russian ballet dancer, Olga Khokhlova, to Saint-Raphaël, a small town popular with British holiday makers situated on the French Riviera between Cannes and Saint Tropez.  Here the newly married couple stayed in the elegant Hôtel Continental et des Bains. Their room and balcony looked out over the sparkling Mediterranean, and it was this setting that inspired Picasso to begin a series of elegant domestic still-lifes in pencil, gouache and watercolor that featured a table placed in front of the open hotel window."
