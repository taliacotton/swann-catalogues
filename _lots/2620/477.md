TYPESET: "Wood engraving on Japan paper, 1945. 279x169 mm; 11x6â…œ inches, full margins. Signed and inscribed \"eigendruck\" in pencil, lower margin. A superb, dark and evenly-printed impression of this very scarce print, with strong contrasts.<br><br>According to Bool, \"In the woodcut Three Spheres I--which incidentally is a masterpiece of woodcutting skill--no spheres are depicted, but flat planes.  The network of white ellipses suggests a spherical shape.  In the top figure we see a frontal view of the flat plane; the three-dimensional suggestion is obvious here.  The central figure has been cut from a sheet of drawing-paper on which the top figure is shown, and then folded over.  The fold should hinder the illusion of space; but no, we immediately tun it into a three dimensional object.  At the bottom Escher put another copy of the top figure, now lying 'on the floor,' but we refuse to believe this and we see it as an elongated egg.\"  Bool 336."
