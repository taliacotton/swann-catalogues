FOOTNOTE: "\". . . I wait patiently. I listen to the voice of the dogs . . . . That . . . warlike something . . . that awakens the imagination: but after a long wait, . . . the rifle, an inconvenient and useless piece of furniture, slips very gently from my hands . . . . The movement of the branches charms me . . . the clouds roll in front of me, I raise my head to follow them while I am thinking of some madrigal, when a slight noise . . . wakes me slowly from my dream. . . . Every day I complain about my carelessness and every day I see . . . hares. I really pity the poor dogs who are regularly tethered all the time they are not hunting . . . .\n\". . . I brought with me several songs from Dante, which . . . I had copied from an Italian edition . . . . When you are sufficiently advanced to hear this sublime poet, you will bless the hour when the idea occurred to you to study his language. What vigor, what imagination, what sweetness and what tender sadness . . . .\""
