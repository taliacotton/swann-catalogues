FOOTNOTE: '6 August1923: ". . . I am not of a financial turn, never have had any practical
  experience in any commercial field and, in writing the Financier and the Titan,
  merely gathered data which made the various processes clear to me. I am pleased
  therefore to find a practical man who looks upon them as accurate. I never had any
  connection with the Chicago Board of Trade, but as a boy often sat in the Gallery
  & watched the turmoil below because--from a dramatic or life point of view it was
  interesting to me. And I''m glad your mother likes The Titan. It is a book I enjoyed
  writing. I fear you will find it hard to pick up a first edition of Sister Carrie.
  I have seen it advertised at $100--so you may guess how scarce it is. I have but
  one copy myself."'
