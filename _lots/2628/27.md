FOOTNOTE: "19 September 1934: \". . . Capt. Austin has been dead for several years. Mr. Bridgeforth is somewhere in Tenn. I believe he has not been with us for many years. . . . Were you to come upon the grounds at night, I doubt if you would know the place, as it has changed in so many ways. . . . You certainly would not recognize the old drill ground as three of the most beautiful buildings on the grounds are on it, viz library, gymnasium and science hall.\""
