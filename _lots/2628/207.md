A letter from Fitzgerald to Maxwell Perkins (circa 1 March, 1929) includes a favorable mention of Lundbergh: \"Will you watch for some stories from a young Holger Lundberg who has appeared in The Mercury? He is a man of some promise and I headed him your way\" (Turnbull, ed., The Letters of F. Scott Fitzgerald, NY, 1963, p. 214)."
