I will not leave Paris until I have resolved the question of the Drama, I will write to you again on this subject. . . . [W]hat is more grave is the impossibility of . . . concentration . . . . I am thoughtless, stupid, dull; you know I have become accustomed to slow and patient thought, a habit of happy days. . . .\n\". . . Your second letter touched me profoundly. . . . All the maternal follies that you write to me . . . moved me. How is it that with a heart so good and so fragile, you are sometimes so blundering . . . ? . . .\"\nPublished in Bibliothéque de la Pléiade, ed. Pichois and Ziegler, vol.
