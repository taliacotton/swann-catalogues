pullquote: "INCLUDES LETTER SIGNED BY EDWARD TELLER MENTIONING OPPENHEIMER & MCCARTHYISM"
FOOTNOTE: "Edward Teller. TLS, \"Edward\": \". . . I firmly believe that McCarthy is gone. I think that he has done us a great service by first establishing McCarthyism and then getting himself discredited. . . .\n\"About the Oppenheimer case I am terribly disturbed and I continue to be disturbed. I hope that somehow in the course of time we shall get to the point where we can forget about it. Reopening the case may bring out even more unpleasant facts and may stir up even more unhappiness. In any case, I am extremely glad that Oppenheimer was retained as Director of the Institute.\n\"One positive thing that may come from all of this may be a more reasonable and liberal approach toward security problems. . . .\" 1 page, 4to, \"University of California\" stationery.
