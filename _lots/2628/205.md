DESCRIPT: FARIÑA, RICHARD.
CROSSHEAD: Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me.
TYPESET: '8vo, publisher''s ¼ green cloth and blue paper-covered boards, very slightly
  skewed, scattered minor soiling; unclipped dust jacket, several old cellotape mends
  on top and bottom edges of verso repairing short closed tears and small nicks, moderate
  dust soiling and edge creasing; endpapers toned with some spotting. <i>First edition,
  inscribed by the author:</i> "G -- Recognize any of these events. We had fun. Dick."
  According to Rare Book Hub, the first signed or inscribed copy to appear at auction.
  It is surmised that the dedicatee is Richard Gillespie who was at Cornell University
  the same time as Fariña and Thomas Pynchon. The three shared the same residence
  in Ithaca and would have crossed paths frequently; Farina was known to have signed
  letters to his friends as "Dick." (For Richard Gillespie see: https://thomaspynchon.com/playing-bridge-with-thomas-pynchon/).
  The fact that the inscription is in red correction pencil suggests it was likely
  accomplished prior to his book signing at the Thunderbird book store in Carmel,
  California (the few copies he signed there were done in ink) whereafter, later that
  same day, 30 April 1966, two days after the novel''s publication, he tragically
  died in a motorcycle accident. A 1960s American counter-culture desideratum.'
