pullquote: "SITTING PRESIDENT READY TO SELL LAND IF BUYERS \"ACT LIKE FAIR AND CANDID MEN\""
FOOTNOTE: "\". . . It is my sincere opinion that the land mentioned in it is worth what I asked for it--to wit four dollars per acre . . . . [L]et those, who are really inclinable to buy, come forward, like men that are in earnest, and say what they will give--If they, or their Agent have seen the land, (and without this it is useless to name any price) have examined its qualities and improvements, they can say what they will give, and ought to act like fair and candid men--On these terms I am ready to treat with them. It is not my intention to dispose of the land for a song, nor is it my wish to higgle, or make many words to the bargain--for which reason I pray them to come to a decision at once, and that you would inform me of the result . . . .\""
