FOOTNOTE: "\"Either beach, I have said, abounds with life. . . .\n\"Venus, being the Paumotuan star of Hades and time-keeper of the dead, was perhaps not unnaturally saddled with this responsibility; the light that chases spectres might well be thought to sicken fish. By all accounts besides, the periodicity is, for each island, regular. The difficulty is that it should vary and be even reversed from isle to isle. Touched with a sense of this, Monsieur Wilmot, conseiller-général, an able man--the author, at least, of an able pamphlet on the archipelago--made a number of well considered experiments. Catching wholesome fish on the outside, he had them sunk . . . to different depths and over different bottoms in the lagoon. Over pearl shell, it appears they remained innocuous; but the proximity of certain sorts of coral, above all in the season of its flowering, poisoned them in an exposure of twelve days. . . .\""
