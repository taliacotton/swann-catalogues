FOOTNOTE: "In 1945, Ezra Pound was arrested by U.S. authorities and charged with treason. Most of his 12-year imprisonment was spent at St. Elizabeths psychiatric hospital in Washington, DC, during which time Pound's case was never brought to trial. In 1956, St. Elizabeths concluded that Pound's condition made him unfit to stand trial. Friends of Pound, including Archibald MacLeish, Graham Greene, Jean Cocteau, and T.S. Eliot, appealed to the U.S. Attorney General to review the case with an eye toward extraditing him to the U.K., if no trial was forthcoming in the U.S. Pound was discharged in 1958, after a judge's motion to dismiss the 1945 indictment went unopposed by the Attorney General."
