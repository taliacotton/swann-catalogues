Right after seeing you, it feels as though I have no need to do any such thing . . . . [I]t feels as though knowing you, you were as much as one lifetime could hold.' How well I understand, sense, your feeling. I'm sure that that sorry feeling will generate in you a greater need than ever to write & photograph--to create the equivalent in form [to] that which is the essence called You. . . . I will tell you about Agnes Meyer. I can realize what an influence she must have been in your young life. For 6 or 7 years she & I were very close friends. . . .\"\nThe postscript: \"You wrote: 'You stood by the doorway & talked to me. I heard every word you said, but I didn't hear any words. For suddenly I saw the thing behind your words. I saw the essence of you, the highly personal . . . you. I was completely destroyed. . . . I was not there. I was not anywhere. I had ceased to exist.'\n\"You will write . . . for anyone feeling as deeply as you do must finally collapse or write. . . .\n\"You say you had ceased to exist. I frequently feel that in reality--I don't actually exist. . . .\""
