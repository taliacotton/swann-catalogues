FOOTNOTE: |-
  19 January 1961: ". . . From a lifetime of Federal service, I have become much aware that the conventional rewards from productive labor are not usually received in public service; but there is a reward from public service not achievable in any other enterprise, and that is the abiding satisfaction of knowing that you have done your honest best to build a stronger and better nation . . . .
  ". . . [T]he principles and programs that we of this Administration have collectively advanced this past eight years need continuing support . . . . I hope and trust that you will find opportunity to remain personally active in the cause of sensible, good government in our country."
  With--Dwight D. Eisenhower. Typed Letter, bearing secretarial signature, to Ambassador McLeod, thanking for a gift. 1 page, 4to, White House stationery. [Washington], 3 January 1958.
