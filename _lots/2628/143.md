FOOTNOTE: "\". . . I believe as you do that traces [outline?] of Vishnu have nothing to do with the ollise figure and that the resemblance is only accidental. However, please cast your eyes on the [entire?] figure and you see that it was made to resemble Vishnu. Besides, I don't need this proof. Other signs suffice for me: [three columns of terms in \"Mexican\" (Aztec, Mayan?), Tibetan and Greek showing cognate relationships] . . . . Would you . . . tell me again a few more words about this figure which has an enormous tongue . . . . Perhaps cite some passage in Sanskrit where this idea is expressed. . . .\""
