  McBride booklabel, usual spotting to front and end matter. <i>First edition.</i>The
  follow-up to Moby-Dick. The notorious opprobrium of the critics towards Melville's
  later novels likely reached their zenith as regards the reception of Pierre, with
  the objections such that his sanity was called into question. Today, the work is
  considered perhaps “the best psychological novel that had yet been written in English”
  (Higgins and Parker, p. 196). A large portion of the first edition of Pierre was
  destroyed in the 1853 fire at Harper & Brothers. BAL 13666.
