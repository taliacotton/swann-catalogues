  "Conceived in the fruitful mind of Robert Gibbings, this is the Golden Cockerel
  book usually compared with the Doves Bible and the Kelmscott Chaucer. A flower among
  the best products of English romantic genius, it is also surely, thanks to its illustrator,
  Eric Gill, the book among all books in which Roman type has been best mated with
  any kind of illustration"-- Chanticleer 78; From Manet to Hockney 89; E.R. Gill,
