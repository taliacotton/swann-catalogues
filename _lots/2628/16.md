FOOTNOTE: "In April of 1794, Morris, together with John Nicholson and others, formed the Asylum Company as a land speculation venture with the expectation of purchasing one million acres in various parts of PA. Morris and his partners identified a ready market in French nationals fleeing the French and Haitian revolutions, many of whom acquired land from the company to settle in Bradford County on the Susquehanna River. Like the other land speculation enterprises in which Morris was involved, such as the North American Land Company, Asylum struggled to realize its ambitions and was dissolved after Morris's death."
