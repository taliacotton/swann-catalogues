FOOTNOTE: "Armstrong: \"I received the lip salve. Thanks very much. I was getting down to just a few tins left. . . .\n\"With your lip salve, Bis Ma Rex [an antacid], and a good laxative, I shall be happy healthy a long long time. They are the rudimentals of life. . . . Don't ever stop making salve. When and if you should stop making the salve, I shall quit playing the trumpet. . . .\"\nErich Kauffmann was the son-in-law of German trombonist Franz Schuritz, who developed and marketed a special lip balm for horn players in the 1930s. Armstrong became a devoted customer, and by the mid-1950s, it was sold as \"Louis Armstrong Lip-Salve.\""
