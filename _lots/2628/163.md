pullquote: "DISUSSING HIS YOUTH IN BERLIN AND THE REBUILDING OF GERMANY"
FOOTNOTE: "\". . . I enjoyed your description of your impressions during your stay in Germany, and it even relieved me to find you had found so much which seemed to be of good portent, in the re-building of devastation-ruined cities; especially that there was re-awakened interest in beautifying places, even amongst the wrecked streets & places [squares?].\n\"It must be one of the strangest experiences imaginable, to return to a city and find every familiar street and place so utterly changed. I should dread the experience, in Berlin W., where for so many years I lived, of finding only demolished houses. . . . [I]n my dreams I especially love to roam along the streets in the vicinity of the LÃ¼tzow Platz; the Maassen Strasse and Nollendorf Platz--the Nazis changed the names already in the mid-thirties! I have the treasure of remembering all these places as they were when I wandered happily about them in my youth. Nothing should ever destroy this. . . .\n\"Yes, I can feel for you when you say you are like an exile, away from your dear wife & boy Christopher; but your present stay in Italy will have the greatest importance for your future development in your art. . . .\""
