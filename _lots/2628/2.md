FOOTNOTE: "\"You are to proceed without delay to form a Magazine of provisions at Pittsburg for twelve hundred Men for four Months. I could wish to have the Magazine completed by the first May next, or if possible before that time.\"\nIn early 1779, George Washington made preparations for a campaign against Fort Detroit from Fort Pitt, requiring attacks against the Seneca villages along the Allegheny River. In April, Washington ordered General Daniel Broadhead to cancel the campaign he led, but, with the approval of Washington, Broadhead continued disrupting the loyalists and allied Indians in the region, destroying crops and dwellings in order to drive them to under-resourced British camps."
