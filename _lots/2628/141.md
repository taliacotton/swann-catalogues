FOOTNOTE: "\". . . I've been up here about a month, and so far the going isn't bad. My present spot isn't what you'd call conveniently located in relation to women and whisky, but I guess you can't have everything . . . . But can you drink double hookers of fresh air with a beer chaser? I don't know, I've never tried.\n\"Once in a while I get a spot of news from Monmouth. My bunch seems to have left Sea Girt for Wood again. Treloar is still flubbing the dub and dodging shipment. . . . Monash beat the game and got out of the army with an honorable discharge. He's now happily--so Florence writes me--doing radio programs for the O[ffice of] W[ar] I[nformation]. . . .\n\". . . Rumors about what's going to happen to us float through the air a dozen a minute since Kiska came back to us--but it's a long time since I've wasted any ink copying down latrinograms. . . .\""
