TYPESET: <p>Although he was born in America, McKnight Kauffer spent his most creative
  years in Great Britain, acting as the "Chef de file" of the new generation of poster
  artists. After his groundbreaking poster design for the <em>Daily Herald</em> was
  published in 1919 (based on his seminal work <em>Flight</em>), he received commissions
  from many major clients, the most important being London Transport, for which he
  designed 141 posters over a span of 20 years. "His 1919 poster, &lt;i&gt;Flight&lt;/i&gt;,
  alluded to Vorticism, a British movement influenced by Cubism and Futurism that
  leaned toward machine-like forms -- by Kauffer’s reckoning 'the first and only Cubist
  poster design in England'" (Aiga.org). This version of <em>Daily Herald</em> is
  a smaller, posthumous version. <em>Rare</em>. V&amp;A E.35-1973, Kauffer 9, Affiche
