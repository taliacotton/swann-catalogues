Saint Andrews Golf Club, founded in 1888 and originally located in Yonkers, New York, is often considered the home of golf in America. In 1892, it consisted of six holes surrounded by apple trees. There was one large apple tree, described at the time as, “The Old Apple Tree where the gang hung their coats, lunch basket and demijohns.” It was also referred to as “the first 19th hole.” Gustavson captures the spirit of that time in this iconic illustration. Gustavson was an excellent golfer himself and illustrated the book How To Play Your Best Golf by Tommy Armour in 1954. He explained that, \"eventually, either by choice, economic pressure, or convenient timing, many artists concentrate on a particular subject which they know a great deal about and are able to interpret with precision and meaning. In my own case, that specialty is painting golf subjects. I have been intimately associated with golf since I was a caddie at the age of twelve and have since won five club championships.\" Gustavson also authored and illustrated the instructional book Enjoy Your Golf: An Illustrated Guide to Better Golf (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1954)."
