Lowndes' short story was the first fictional work inspired by the infamous Whitechapel murders of 1888. She subsequently wrote a novel of the same name, which was published in serialized form by The Daily Telegraph in 1913, and in book form by leading publishers in Europe and the United States the same year. Since its publication, the terrifying tale has inspired numerous radio, film, and television adaptations, beginning with Alfred Hitchcock’s The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog, 1927."
