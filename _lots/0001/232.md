In this illustration, Gustavson recreates an image of the first and oldest clubhouse in America, which was designed by Stanford White in 1891 and opened in 1892. Although it has been enlarged over the years, the original clubhouse still serves its members to this day.Gustavson was an excellent golfer himself and illustrated the book How To Play Your Best Golf by Tommy Armour in 1954. He explained that, \"eventually, either by choice, economic pressure, or convenient timing, many artists concentrate on a particular subject which they know a great deal about and are able to interpret with precision and meaning. In my own case, that specialty is painting golf subjects. I have been intimately associated with golf since I was a caddie at the age of twelve and have since won five club championships.\" Gustavson also authored and illustrated the instructional book Enjoy Your Golf: An Illustrated Guide to Better Golf (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1954)."
