Each tipped to board with window matte; framed individually. Accompanied by a framed printed tear sheet of the comic. Provenance: W. Russell Button, Inc., Chicago, IL, with their labels on frame backings; Doyle New York, October 5, 2016, lot 41; Sportsman's Gallery, Charleston, S.C., July 2017; thence to Dick McDonough.During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Frost created thousands of illustrations for esteemed periodicals such as Harper's Weekly, Scribner's and Life as well as hundreds of oils and watercolors. He is probably best known for his hunting, shooting and golf images like this humorous series that follows the actions and increasing frustration of an unlucky player and his poor caddy. The amusing nota bene in the ultimate panel reading \"he played next day as usual,\" shows the unfailing determination of a typical golfer."
