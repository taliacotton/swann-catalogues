TYPESET: "BOB ZIERING (1933- )\nMalcolm X. Promotional illustration for the 1986 City Opera production of \"X—The Life and Times of Malcolm X.\" Pen and ink on paper. 520x195mm; 20¼x7¾ inches, on 25½x19¾-inch sheet. Signed \"Ziering\" in lower center image. Anthony Davis' ground-breaking production premiered at the American Music Theater Festival in Philadelphia in 1985 before it was revised and expanded upon for the City Opera in New York the following year. In 2010, City Opera collaborated with the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture on an abridged concert version to commemorate the 45th anniversary of Malcolm X's assassination. In this portrait, Ziering adeptly captures the power and determination of the great civil rights leader through an economy of line.Ziering received his first serious commission from Reader's Digest. His subsequent illustration work for Fortune 500 companies and cultural institutions, such as The Metropolitan Opera and Cirque du Soleil, has earned him several ANDY awards, the highest honor awarded to commercial illustrators. After working as an illustrator for more than forty years, Ziering now devotes his time to expressing his personal artistic vision in his New York City studio."
