Two printed tear sheets of the advertisement accompany the artwork, one of which is larger and framed. Provenance: The collection of Dick McDonough.The ad campaigns for Kuppenheimer clothing and Arrow Collar were Leyendecker's most famous and longest-running. This study shows his typical working method, wherein he would sketch in a composition and alter segments of it before applying oil and turpentine, often creating several versions. The final published image for this ad would change the farmboy's position to a three-quarter view, surrounded by a cornucopia of fall produce. The caption read: \"Walking, standing, or sitting, the man who wears Kuppenheimer good clothes, gets the full benefit of style that is tailored into the garment. They drape gracefully with every reach and turn of the body.\""
