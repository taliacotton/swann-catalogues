Provenance: From the collection of Dick McDonough.Briggs’ 1916 book of golf cartoons generally focuses on the humorous blunders and embarrassments of the “duffer,” but also gives a fascinating glimpse into daily life on the course in the early days of the nascent sport. Though he dedicated the book “to the Scoffers, the Duffers, and the Golfer,” he speaks of his fondness for the “duffer” in his introduction: “I prefer the thoughts of a duffer, because I believe in my cartoons of him I can reach the majority who make up the golf world. I do not have to exaggerate, I do not have to imagine. One need only to observe and draw only the real happenings, repeat the actual sayings, and depict true expressions.”Though he claimed to be a “duffer,” Briggs was an avid golfer and often played at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, the first public course in the United States. He was also a founding member of the Wykagyl Country Club in Westchester County, New York."
