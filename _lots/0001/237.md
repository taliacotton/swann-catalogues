Signed \"Gustavson AWS\" (American Watercolor Society) in lower right image. Tipped to board; matted and framed.Provenance: Illustration House, November 1994; thence to Dick McDonough. Gustavson was an excellent golfer himself and illustrated the book How To Play Your Best Golf by Tommy Armour in 1954. He explained that, \"eventually, either by choice, economic pressure, or convenient timing, many artists concentrate on a particular subject which they know a great deal about and are able to interpret with precision and meaning. In my own case, that specialty is painting golf subjects. I have been intimately associated with golf since I was a caddie at the age of twelve and have since won five club championships.\""
