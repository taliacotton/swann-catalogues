TYPESET: "JO FISCHER (1900-1987)\n\"From 9 to 5.\" Together, group of 8 original \"From 9 to 5\" single-panel daily comics, published 1947-50, and 1954, most with Sun and Times Co. pastedowns. Pen, ink and Zip-A-Tone over graphite with correction fluid on stiff paper. Most about 200x155 mm; 7¾x6 inches, on 10x9-inch sheets. Most signed \"Jo Fischer\" and dated within image area, with typed captions pasted in lower margins. Taped to mattes and individually framed. “From 9 to 5” follows the gossip and daily interactions between the office administrators, Hysteria, Deleria, Angora, and Coma, and their exasperated boss, Mr. Wump. The women are fashionably outfitted in the latest styles, with calf-length pencil skirts, tight tops, ankle-twisting high heels, and long eyelashes. The comic ran for more than 30 years, and at its peak, was printed in 100 newspapers nationwide. Regular readers often contributed gag ideas, and if Fischer used a suggestion, he recognized the fan by incorporating his or her name and location in the comic through signs hung on the sides of desks."
