Catalogue number 32.The most successful and famous student of Howard Pyle, the \"Father of Modern Illustration,\" Wyeth became one of the most important American illustrators in the canon. He was best known for dramatic depictions of historical scenes for literary classics through the widely-distributed Scribner's Classics series in the 1910s and 20s. In that tradition, his beautiful pen work for this book, published in commemoration of the first \"Pilgrim Tercentenary\" and hailed as one of the best gift books of that year, captures the essence of Longfellow's narrative poem about Plymouth Colony's famous love triangle."
