TYPESET: "Portrait published in The Saturday Review of Literature, February 6, 1932. Pen and ink on paper. Signed \"G. P. du Bois\" in lower right image, and dated \\[19\\]32. Archivally matted and framed with gallery and exhibition labels on verso of backing board. Not removed from frame for inspection.\n\nPène du Bois’ portrait of Lytton Strachey, the British writer and critic, was published shortly after Strachey’s death, which occurred on January 21, 1932. Pène du Bois depicts the author in his characteristic beard and horn-rimmed glasses while seated and absorbed in his own thoughts. A founding member of the Bloomsbury Group and author of Eminent Victorians (1918), Strachey is known for his biographies that combined psychological insight with witty irreverence. Pène du Bois’ inclusion of a rough portrait of Queen Victoria hanging on the wall is a subtle nod to Strachey’s 1921 biography of the Queen, which was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.\n\nPène du Bois began contributing illustrations of literary figures for _The Saturday Review of Literature_ upon his return to the United States in 1930 after spending four years in France."
