TYPESET: "ROBERT GROSSMAN (1940-2018)\nNew York Mets. Cartoon possibly published in Look magazine, circa 1970s. Airbrush on board. 154x117 mm; 6x4½ inches, on 10x8-inch board. Initialed \"RG\" in lower left image. Best known for creating the iconic poser for the 1980 film Airplane!, Grossman was a prolific illustrator and caricaturist who contributed to leading publications, including Rolling Stone, The New York Times, New York magazine, Esquire, National Lampoon, and Sports Illustrated. He received an Academy Award nomination in 1977 for his animated short Jimmy the C. This charming cartoon shows Grossman's adept skill for airbrush, a medium that he first encountered as a child at his father's silk-screen printing shop, and eventually mastered. Graphic design scholar, Steven Heller, praised the distinctive aesthetic the illustrator achieved: “Grossman kind of redefined the genre of caricature by introducing the airbrush as a tool. He gave it a kind of sculptural but at the same time comic form. He gave it shades and gradients that the others didn’t do. And at the same time he also captured likenesses with brilliant precision and great wit.”"
