TYPESET: "Bronze with brown patina, conceived in 1907. This is one of nine castings. 203x158x191 mm; 8x6¼x7½ inches. <br><br>Provenance: Kathleen Esther Garman, (Lady Epstein); \tEdward P. Schinman; Private collection, by descent from above; Martin Diamond Fine Arts Inc, NY; Private collection, acquired from above January 10, 1978. <br><br>Exhibited: The Jewish Museum, NY, <i>The Immigrant Generations: Jewish Artists in Britain 1900-1945</i>, May - October 1983. <br><br>The subject of this bronze is Romily John (1906-1986), son of artist Augustus John (1878-1961).  Jacob Epstein was born in America but moved to France at a young age to study art.  In 1905 he left Paris and settled in London where he met and befriended Augustus John.  This bronze was a commission by John. Epstein created two other known variations on this subject. You can see, in the simplification of the facial features as well as the smooth abstracted cap, the begining of Epstein's exploration of modernist forms."
