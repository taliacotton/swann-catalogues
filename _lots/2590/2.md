DESCRIPT: SIR JACOB EPSTEIN (1880 - 1959, AMERICAN/BRITISH)
CROSSHEAD: Romilly John.
TYPESET: "<p>Bronze with brown patina, conceived in 1907. This is one of nine castings.
  203x158x191 mm; 8x6¼x7½ inches. <br><br>The subject of this bronze is Romily John
  (1906-1986), son of artist Augustus John (1878-1961). Jacob Epstein was born in
  America but moved to France at a young age to study art. In 1905 he left Paris and
  settled in London where he met and befriended Augustus John. This bronze was a commission
  by John. Epstein created two other known variations on this subject. You can see,
  in the simplification of the facial features as well as the smooth abstracted cap,
  the beginning of Epstein's exploration of modernist forms.</p>"
