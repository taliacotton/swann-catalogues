year: 1941
at-a-glance: ""
TYPESET: "Silver print, the image measuring 9⅜x7⅜ inches (23.8x18.7 cm.), the sheet slightly larger, with a PM magazine and date stamp (1941), notations, in pencil, in an unknown hand, and a Culver Pictures label and barcode, on verso. 1941"
footnote_provenance: "Snow famously described Harper's Bazaar as a magazine for \"well-dressed women with well-dressed minds.\" She hired photojournalist Martin Munkacsi to shoot a swimwear story (his first foray into fashion) that marked the first instance of a model photographed outdoors in motion, as well as Diana Vreeland for a column called \"Why Don't You...?\" (she eventually became fashion editor), and Alexey Brodovitch as art director the very night she first encountered his work. Snow served as editor-in-chief from 1934 to 1958."
