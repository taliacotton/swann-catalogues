footnote_provenance: "Acquired from the Estate of Diane Arbus by the Present Owner, a New York, Collector, in the early 1970s.\n\nThe owner, also an artist, knew Arbus: \"I met Diane when I was in art school. It seems incredible to me now, but she liked the drawings I was doing in the late 1960s, so she and I worked out a trade. I chose the “Tattooed Man,” and Diane was going to visit my studio and choose a work of mine. We never completed it, and a year after Diane died I acquired the print from her estate.\""
