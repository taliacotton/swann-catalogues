TYPESET: "  <br><br>Likely used to create the iconic Kodak lifesized cardboard cutouts featured in retail settings, each of the models--most of them clad in colorful bikinis--is posed jauntily with a camera, and sometimes with other accessories like slide trays, film, and cases. With flipped bobs and cheeky grins, the models are also often wearing a sailor or other military-style hat, many of the pages are titled \"Military Maids.\" Chromogenic prints, the images measuring 4½x2¾ inches (11.4x7 cm.), and slightly smaller, and the reverse, mounted recto/verso to album pages with acetate sleeves, most with the model's name silver-stamped on recto (three with her name on a paper label on the mount), and the Kodacolor backmark on verso. 4to, original black binder with the Kodak logo on the cover; three-ring binding. Late 1960s"
