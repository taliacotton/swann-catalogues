Despite their uncompromising reputation and having no official leadership of their many separate clans, the Marind people enjoyed a celebratory and peaceful life amongst themselves. This collection of photographs captures the serenity and culture of the tribe through intimate portraits detailing traditional costume and body art, documentation of tribes-people hunting and fishing, and the village architecture.
