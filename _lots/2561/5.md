footnote_provenance: "An artist and innovator, Muybridge is known for being a pioneer of the motion picture. He moved the field of photography towards instantaneous photography by shortening exposure times, experimenting with chemicals to develop film, and developing a special shutter and electrical timer, which allowed him to capture sequences of people and animals in motion. His invention the zoopraxiscope, a projection device, was used to animate his image sequences, becoming a precursor to cinema."
