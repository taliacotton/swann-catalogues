FOOTNOTE: "\"A writer commenting on William Wall's advertisement for his views, which appeared in the 26 June 1823 issue of the Commercial Advertiser, noted a few days later in the same paper that the 'views taken by Mr. Wall are the most accurate description that we have seen. One of them is taken from Brooklyn Heights, near the Distillery of the Messrs. Pierponts, and the other from the Mountain at Weehawk. Mr. W. at first made a drawing from the high land back of Hoboken; but the view from Weehawk is far preferable, as it not only affords a commanding prospect of the city but also of the whole of our beautiful harbor, with all the islands, &c.'\" -- Deak 336."
