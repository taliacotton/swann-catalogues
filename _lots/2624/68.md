FOOTNOTE: "Scarce record of the prosperous mining operations in Idaho Territory's Boise Basin in the early 1860s. The fine bird's eye view of Buena Vista and Idaho City mining districts shows the rapidly pioneered settlements laid out in the thick of the vast wilderness; a numbered legend indicates 32 mines and ranches within a 90 square mile area on the Jordan Creek south of the Snake River. Most of the sites shown here, experiencing such a boom at the time, are now ghost towns, or at least very near to it. \n\nThe map appeared in George Owens' General Directory and Business Guide of the Principal Towns East of the Cascade Mountains, for the Year 1865."
