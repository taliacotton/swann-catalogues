FOOTNOTE: "A testament to Baltimore's significant growth in the decades following the Revolutionary War - showing considerable development of the city in comparison to A.P. Folie's foundational chart of the Inner Harbor published less than ten years prior. \n\nThe downtown area defines its original street grid and roads leading out of town, wharves extending into the upper basin, and is keyed with a 28-point legend of public buildings or landmarks. In the rural reaches beyond the city the land is peppered with scores of named property owners and their estates. \n\nScarce, with one example traced in market records and less than 10 institutional copies located. Wheat & Brun 526."
