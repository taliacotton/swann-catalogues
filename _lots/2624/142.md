FOOTNOTE: "Celebrated world map published in \"Novus Orbis Regionum\", Johann Huttich and Simon Grynaeus's 1532 anthology of early voyages. The geography of the map, outdated by the time of its publication, represents North America as a slim island region labeled \"Terra de Cuba\" and is a reversion to the Waldseemuller world map of 1507. Great advancement in the cartography of the New World had been made in these intervening 25 years. However, \"What the Münster-Holbein map lacks in precision, it gains in richness of artistic decoration\" (Shirley.)\n\nThe elaborate woodcut borders were designed by the great Northern Renaissance painter Hans Holbein the Younger and enhance the map with a rich sense of artistic ornamentation. Imagery from around the world appears in the spandrels surrounding the globe which would have appeared quite fantastic to contemporary viewers: exotic animals and peoples, East Indian spices of nutmeg and pepper, an image of the Italian traveler Varthema journeying about, and a terrifying sight of cannibalism. At either pole, angels turn crank handles to rotate the world on its axis, an early reflection of the Copernican model which was not a widely explicit theory until the publication of his De Revolutionibus in 1543.\n\nAs presently seen, the name of the Asian continent is printed in large block capitals and is the \"version of the map normally associated with the earlier printings\" -- Shirley 67."
