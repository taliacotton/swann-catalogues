FOOTNOTE: "An excellent example of Ristow's fifth state of the improved 1818 edition of this significant piece of American cartography, the first accurate depiction of the continental United States presented as a unified landmass between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Melish's important document produced an early visual flicker to the idea of Manifest Destiny and established the tone of the hundred years to follow in which the fledgling nation turned its focus from east to west and settled the continent. \n\n\"At a glance the whole extent of the United States territory from sea to sea... The view is complete and leaves nothing to be wished for.\" - John Melish regarding his own map (Mapping the West). \n\nRistow, A la Carte, pages 174-176; Cohen, Mapping the West, pages 102-104. "
