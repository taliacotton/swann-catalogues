FOOTNOTE: "\"Advertisement to the third edition - The Publishers have great pleasure in acknowledging the patronage which this work has received, and now submit this third edition with a confidence that it will be found materially improved. All the changes that have taken place throughout this continent, since the publication of the former edition, are, it is believed, to be found here, as they have used every exertion to obtain the necessary information. The changes throughout our country are so rapid, that it is almost impossible to keep pace with them; and it will not, therefore, be thought extraordinary, if some errors should be found, although they hope and believe there are very few\".
