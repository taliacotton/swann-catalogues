FOOTNOTE: "The set offered here is one of three existing examples, one of which is
  in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The last set (the
  original Polaroids) remains in the collection of the artist. Walker Evans' portrait
  of Carrey is also in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum.\n\nIn the summer
  of 1974, Evans was working to finish a book on Main Street, USA as seen through
  vintage postcards. Carrey, a photographer herself, had become known as someone who
  could wrangle artists and get results. Carrey's introductory text and the photographs
  document their time together, including trips to the beach, meals, everyday details
  of Evans' home and life (including his bills, matches, clothing, and more), and
  their encounters as they lived and worked side by side. \n\nThe images are an intimate
  portrait of one of the most influential photographers of the century and are delightful
  and revealing in their detail. Their articulate, descriptive qualities nod to Evans'
  own elegant and direct style, and the portraits of the photographer offer a rare
  glimpse of the charismatic and elusive man himself."
