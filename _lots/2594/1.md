CROSSHEAD: An album with 60 photographs celebrating the investiture of Maharaja Jagatjit
  Singh of Kapurthala.
TYPESET: <p>This album represents one of the most comprehensive photographic depictions
  of a 19th century maharaja and his court. With his titles, riches, affairs, and
  estates, the Maharaja Jagatjit Singh of Kapurthala was internationally known as
  the epitome of Indian royalty. His coronation album includes both formal and informal
  portraits of Jagatjit Singh and his fellow princes, his administrators and distinguished
  guests, including Prince Albert Victor on a pig sticking expedition, taken three
  years before his death. </p><p>The album includes views of Jagatjit Singh’s palaces,
  private and public buildings, and the palace grounds. There are images of Kapurthala’s
  royal stable, his elephants (including his famously enormous state pachyderm), his
  horses (with a striking image of the Maharaja on his favorite steed), his dogs,
  durbars, tennis games, and remarkable images of His Highness’s servants pedaling
  Jagatjit Singh and his chihuahua in a velocipede and paddle boat. Included are views
  of the city market, temples, and a two-panel panorama of Kapurthala. Albumen prints,
  the images measuring approximately 9½x11¾ inches (24.1x29.8 cm.), and slightly smaller,
  and the reverse, mounted recto/verso, each with a caption, in ink, on the mount.
  Oblong leather folio, with the gilt-lettered title "Kapurthala;" with a new leather
  spine replacing the cloth spine that had been applied by Maria Brothers in Simla;
  signed by Jagatjit Singh in 1891 on the front free endpaper. 1890</p>
at-a-glance: ''
FOOTNOTE: "Jagatjit Singh of Kapurthala created an image of himself as a dashing,
  romantic figure. He became famous in his day for his spectacular gems and his secularism.
  He traveled the world, served as British India’s representative to the League of
  Nations, received 28 Grand Crosses. \n\nBelieving himself the incarnation of Louis
  IV, he spoke fluent French, built a palace after Versailles, hosted lavish parties
  in Paris and on the Riviera, and added a Spanish dancer and a Czech countess to
  his harem of four. \n\nThough it appears that this album was meant to be a souvenir,
  we have not been able to locate another copy (including in the Kapurthala family's
  collection, the Royal Collection, and the India Office Library). \n\nGiven the quality
  of the photographs, we propose the photographer may have been Lala Deen Dayal who
  at this time was the Viceroy's official photographer."
