FOOTNOTE: "In the summer of 1865, Cameron began using larger format 15x12-inch glass negatives. She embarked upon a series of large-scale, close-up portraits, which she saw as a rejection of conventional photography in favor of a less precise but more emotionally compelling kind of portraiture. She wrote to Henry Cole that she intended this new series to \"electrify you with delight and startle the world.\"\n\nThere are no other prints known of this portrait of Alice Keown. She was the daughter of Thomas Keown, and Cameron also photographed her sister Elizabeth and brother Percy. Alice was not known as Baby Blossom, so it is thought that perhaps Cameron took the title from Ida White's recently published poem.\n\nThis print was exhibited in <i>Photographs from the Collection of Gary and Barbara Hansen,</i> the Saint Louis Art Museum, June 23 - August 9, 1987\n\nJulian Cox, <i>Julia Margaret Cameron: The Complete Photographs</i> (The J. Paul Getty Museum), cat. no. 878, p. 384; Larry J. Schaaf, <i>Sun Pictures Catalogue Twenty, Julia Margaret Cameron</i> (Hans P. Kraus), no. 6, p. 22-23"
