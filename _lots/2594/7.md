FOOTNOTE: "Around 1832 Parisian-born Charles-François Bossu (1813–1879) changed his unfortunate last name (\"bossu\" means hunchback in French) and adopted the pseudonym Marville, which also transformed his identity. By 1850 he began taking poetic photographs throughout Old Paris, a project that foreshadows the work of another great French artist, Eugène Atget."
