FOOTNOTE: |-
  Gurney was one of the pioneering practitioners of the daguerreotype process, opening the first American photo gallery at 189 Broadway in 1840. His work is known for its fine detail, and for a clientele base from New York City's elite, building a reputation as the city's leading daguerreotypist. In 1851, Gurney founded the American Daguerre Associationâ€”the first national organization of photographers.

  By the early 1850s, he was housed at 349 Broadway, where he occupied nine rooms. In 1858 he built a three-story studio at 707 Broadway, apparently the first building constructed for the purpose of photography in the United States.

  William Lewis Dayton was the first Republican vice-presidential nominee in 1856. Although his campaign was unsuccessful, Dayton proved to be a talented diplomat in his foreign affairs. Following his vice-presidential campaign, Dayton then served as the American ambassador to France. There, he successfully worked against the French recognition of the Confederate States of America. He was later appointed to Minister of France. Dayton served until his death in December of 1864 in Paris, France.
