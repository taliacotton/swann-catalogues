FOOTNOTE: "\"May I thank you for . . . support of my statement about the recent situation in Chicago. . . .<br><br>\"I am very much concerned, as you are, that basic American freedoms are being trampled underfoot in situations like the Chicago disorders. That is why I made reference to the possible need for a congressional investigation. I am pleased that the President's Commission on Violence, headed by Milton Eisenhower, has agreed to look into the Chicago tragedy.\"<br><br>On June 10, 1968, spurred by the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy, President Lyndon B. Johnson formed by executive order the U.S. National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, chaired by Milton S. Eisenhower. Among the Commission's tasks was the investigation of the civil rights demonstrations taking place in cities across the country, including those surrounding the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. A team of hundreds interviewed over 1,000 witnesses to the violence that took place during those demonstrations, resulting in the release of the Walker Report on December 1 of that year, concluding that nearly all demonstrators were intent upon peaceful demonstration and that a small number of police should be prosecuted for indiscriminate violence. In September of the following year, the spectacular trial of seven protestors charged with conspiracy and inciting a riot--the Chicago Seven--gripped the nation's attention. Although some were initially convicted, an appeal resulted in the reversal of all convictions."
