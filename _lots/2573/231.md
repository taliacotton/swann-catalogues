TYPESET: "Lacking errata. Half-title. 4to, contemporary limp morocco, spine darkened with tips rubbed, top edges and turn ins gilt; split along gutter to prelim, bound without original wrappers, ownership inscription. <i>One of 2000 numbered copies issued on handmade paper.</i> This is effectively the second impression of the First Edition, printed by Darantiere from the First Edition plates as soon as that edition was exhausted. It was printed for Joyce's patron Harriet Weaver, who was unable to find a printer in England, and distributed mainly by Rodker and Ezra Pound, working from Paris. At least 500 copies were intercepted by U.S. Customs, and this issue has since become less common than the First Edition. Slocum & Cahoon A18."
