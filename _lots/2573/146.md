FOOTNOTE: '"Emil White showed me the letter . . . . I''m in a bit of a quandary. Had
  I (in 1945) offered you the ''Cancer'' as a gift? (How the matter got sidetracked
  all this time is beyond me.)<br><br>". . . At this moment I couldn''t send you a
  copy--I''m flat broke. (We''ve just had an addition to the family and other expenses.)
  To get a copy might cost $12 to $15. However, sometimes I get one free (from a tourist
  returning from France). Should that happen, I''d be glad to give you one pronto.
