FOOTNOTE: '". . . As for Mr. Kennedy''s administration--we must wait to see what it
  does; so far, what we see is Laos and more Polaris missiles. The spread of nuclear
  weapons to new Powers immensely increases the danger of nuclear war and therefore
  the likelihood of disaster. Chemical and biological warfare are as much to be condemned
  as nuclear warfare. The only answer to all dangers is the outlawing of war."'

  in] Laos, pointing out that the proliferation of weapons means an increased probability
  of disaster, condemning nuclear and chemical weapons equally, suggesting the outlawing
  of war, and, in a postscript: "Kindly note that I do not advocate unilateral nuclear
  disarmament for the U.S." Â½ page, 4to, "Plas Penrhyn" stationery; folds.'
