DESCRIPT: FROST, ROBERT.
CROSSHEAD: Collected Poems.
TYPESET: 8vo, publisher's gilt-stamped brown cloth, slight lean, few light stains;
  front hinge cracked. First edition. <i>Author's presentation copy, signed twice
  by Frost, and with the entirety of perhaps his most famous poem "Stopping by Woods
  on a Snowy Evening" accomplished by him in holograph</i> in black ink on the recto
  of the portrait frontispiece and differing slightly from the published version ("neer"
  misspelling in line 6, and "give" for "gives in line 9). Inscribed on the front
  flyleaf "For Unade and Howard and / Elizabeth Seckerson / from their guest friend
  / Robert Frost / March 15 1939 / Storrs." The "guest friend" mention is a nod to
  Frost's several short stays at the Seckerson's home when in Storrs to give a reading.
  Howard Seckerson started the English Department at the University of Connecticut,
  Storrs, and his wife Unade Seckerson (n√©e Barnes) was the daughter of Djuna Barnes'
  half-brother Duane. We trace a small number of inscribed Frost editions featuring
  this poem sold at auction with one stanza or just the last verse in Frost's hand
  but finding the poem complete as here makes this of great significance, further
  enhanced by an excellent provenance.
