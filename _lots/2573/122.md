My wife as the president of the Polish White Cross in France desires to tell the valourous patriotic youth that her Committee will endeavour to do everything possible to provide them with necessary comfort stop. We both beg of you to convey to them our regret . . . .\"<br><br>Since 1914, the Polish community in America had been considering ways to achieve an independent state for Poland, free of the control of Russia, Prussia, and Austria. In January 1917, Colonel Arthur D. Le Pan at the Canadian Officer Training School near what is today the University of Toronto started training a group of Polish soldiers intending for them to form the beginnings of a Polish national army. When the U.S. declared war against Germany in April, I.J. Paderewski proposed that a Polish force be assembled as part of the U.S. Army; those Poles in the States who had not yet obtained citizenship were then recruited for the purpose and sent to Le Pan's training camp across Lake Ontario from the officer's school. Paderewski and his wife visited the camp on at least one occasion between 1917 and 1918."
