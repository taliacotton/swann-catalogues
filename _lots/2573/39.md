FOOTNOTE: '15 October 1934: ". . . 1. . . . I believe that under a drastic inflation
  of the currency wages would lag far behind prices . . . . I do not believe that
  properly managed it would constitute inflation were a program of remunerative public
  works [established], like the providing of proper housing, financed by treasury
  bonds secured by the value of the new wealth created and the new wealth afforded
  instead of by the interest bearing bonds. . . .<br><br>3. I am wholly and entirely
  opposed to the sales of munitions to foreign nations either by private individuals
  or corporations or by the government of the United States. . . .<br><br>"6. I favor
  public works to fight depression and believe the present program grossly inadequate.
  The . . . public works which I favor is an immense housing program.<br><br>"7. The
  federal budget can only be safely balanced by a drastic increase in income and inheritance
  taxes. I have long supported a tax on wealth . . . for the purpose of reducing or
  wiping out . . . debt. . . ."'
