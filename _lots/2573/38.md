FOOTNOTE: "\"Last week twenty-eight coal miners died like rats in a hole, as a result of an explosion in the Duvin Coal Company Mine in Providence, Kentucky. The loss of these lives was preventable, and the accumulation of explosive quantities of gas and dust was contrary to law. Inadequate and criminally negligent mine inspection permitted this financially irresponsible coal company to operate without regard to the safety of the lives its employees. As a result . . . the wives and children of these men become dependent upon public charity. The same hazard of eminent disaster hangs over hundreds of other coal mines.<br><br>\"Surely, each member of Congress would be glad to contribute to the saving of human life, by creating more safe conditions in coal mines. S. 2420 and H.R. 6352 . . . are designed to accomplish this end. . . .<br><br>\"Some coal operators have registered their opposition to this measure, alleging that state inspection is adequate. . . .<br><br>\". . . Our coal industry is the most hazardous and deadly of all industries, and our fatality rate exceeds by many times that of any other country. The organized mine workers of this nation plead for this degree of consideration from the members of their Congress.\""
