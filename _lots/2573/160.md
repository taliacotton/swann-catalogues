FOOTNOTE: '"My having had to attend to . . . bringing out my ''Table Book,'' must
  plead as an excuse for not giving an earlier answer to your letter . . . requesting
  . . . a vignette on the title page of your forthcoming work.<br><br>"I . . . assure
  you, that a woodengraving, from the smallness of the size, would be very ineffective
  and indeed unless some particular point of bad conduct on the part of the officials
  of the prison--or the fact of some accident occurring to some of the prisoners--the
  mere representation of females on the treadwheel would go for nothing. I speak .
  . . having been engaged . . . in an attempt to get up something (graphically) against
  this system of discipline as regards women, when it was first brought into use and
  we decided that nothing could be done in that way without gross exaggeration--a
  thing, I am sure, quite contrary to your desires . . . ."'
DESCRIPT: CRUIKSHANK, GEORGE.
CROSSHEAD: Autograph Letter Signed, "GeoCruikshank," with two small graphite drawings,
  on the verso.
TYPESET: 'The letter, to "Dear Sir," explaining that a small wood engraving would
  be ineffective, as would representing women on a treadmill, and, in a postscript,
  "I saw Mr. [Joseph?] Sleap yesterday, and knowing what I was about to write to you
  requested me to inform you that the plates will be finished in a few days." The
  drawings, each a series of sketches. The first, showing a man peering over a table
  surrounded by sitting figures or body parts, with the holograph captions: "Moxhay"
  and "Archaeologist." The second, showing the heads of three people whose hats are
  in the shape of dwellings with tiny people visible in the windows and doors, with
  two holograph captions: "The Head of the Table, the Head of the Family" and "D J
  Coulton, Britannica." 2 pages, 9x7Â¼ inches, written and drawn on the recto and verso
  of a single sheet; minor soiling at all edges, horizontal fold.'
