FOOTNOTE: "\"It is of great importance that we sh'd put forth all our debating powers in the ensuing discussion on the state of the nation.<br><br>\". . . I well remember the efficient aid you used occasionally to afford our common cause; I often regret . . . that you so rarely come forward to do that which you have shown you can do well.\"<br><br>During a parliamentary session on July 2, 1849, Disraeli moved that a select committee be formed to debate on the state of the nation. He explained that his motion was motivated by the growth of poverty and certain weaknesses in the economy relating to foreign trade which had coincided with the start of Robert Peel's government. In subsequent days, after Peel delivered a speech in response, the greater part of the House of Commons rallied to Peel's defense."
