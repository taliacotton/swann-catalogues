FOOTNOTE: "\". . . You must not understand me as objecting to the amount of your charge in reference to the Christiana trials. My object was simply to let you know that I had no recollection of expressing a wish that you should attend them on the part of the United States, or any intention to employ you to do so; . . . I felt bound to acquaint you with this fact, lest my want of recollection might do you injustice, and prevent you from showing by other evidence that you were employed on the part of the Government.\"<br><br>In September of 1851, in Christiana, PA, a group of fugitive enslaved people and their allies resisted the efforts of agents enforcing the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, resulting in the death of Maryland slaveholder Edward Gorsuch. In late November of 1851, a federal treason trial was held to try the organizers of the \"Christiana Riot.\" After mere minutes of deliberation, the jury acquitted the defendants, none of whom returned to slavery."
