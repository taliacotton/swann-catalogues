FOOTNOTE: "\"It is only an impression of mine that the phoebe note of the chickadee is uttered by the female. I have no proof. I do not remember what I say about it in the article you refer to. I did not know as the article had been published. I charged the editor to be sure & send me proof, & if I have said positively that the female alone makes the note, I am vexed that I did not have a chance to correct or modify the statement in the proof. I got my impression by observing a pair of chickadees that one season nested near my house & that came under my notice many times a day. . . . [T]he note has decidedly a feminine sound. But for all that I may be in error. . . .\""
