FOOTNOTE: "\"A writer does 'think up' his characters; but if you'll consider the problem for a minute, what can he possibly 'think them up' out of, except his own experience? Of course, he can adapt the phantoms of novels, television, and movies, but even these he has to see for himself. The best and most vivid writing rises out of one's own experience, transmuted into fiction, not merely reproduced. Good luck!\""
