FOOTNOTE: "\"Don't break any more lances for me I beg you, or if you break any don't tell me just as I avoid telling you the battles that I wage for you and others. . . . [W]hat surprises me is to see that one asks me to lecture on painters (which . . . I do not do) and that Apollinaire writes to me that I take with him the moral direction of our social circle. I have nothing to complain about . . . apart from receiving 'great talent' (good term for Suarès) from the height of the Eiffel Tower on my poor Roman skull. If Cap [his Ode à Picasso: Le Cap de Bonne-Espérance (1919)] and Potomak [Le Potomak (1919)] are works of 'great talent' I'll burn them.<br><br>\"So haven't you received 4 letters from me, 2 letters from Picasso? . . .<br><br>\"Mad impatience to see your new work. I can report a few poems and the Parade, beautiful like a puppet.\""
