FOOTNOTE: "\". . . As regards penicillin in colds. This is a tricky matter. It has no effect on the virus but then how many so called colds are due to virus. I think that many are simple bacterial infections and even then, if the virus is the primary infection most of the troubles after the first two days are due to the secondary bacterial infection.<br><br>\"There can be no doubt that penicillin is effective on all these bacteria except Pfeiffer's bacillus and even some of these are sensitive.<br><br>\"In the past we have been very quiet about the use of penicillin as a 'cold cure.' There have been so many flops in that direction and as regards the extract from Lapin issued by Bristol and Co., this is just what I was afraid would happen. If this system does not develop fast organisms it would be excellent, but it would be a disaster if it bred out resistant races. . . .<br><br>\". . . I suppose it would be necessary to give about 50,000 units of penicillin twice a day. This would be quite expensive. If you do anything like that I shall be very glad indeed to know the result.\"<br><br>With--The retained draft of Dr. Story's typed letter to Fleming. 1Â¼ page, 4to, onionskin paper.
