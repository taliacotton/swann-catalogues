  <i>First edition, in the very scarce, and unrestored, dust jacket.</i> Shapiro's
  first novel and the only one to bear his real name. Henceforth all his books would
  be published under the name John Sanford. In the 1950s his career as a Hollywood
  screenwriter was thwarted when he was among those blacklisted after he refused to
  testify in the Senator McCarthy-led HUAC hearings. A friend of Nathanael West, Shapiro/Sanford
  went on to write more than 20 novels, and is now considered to be among the unjustly
  neglected figures of post-war American letters.
