FOOTNOTE: '". . . I have found an opportunity to get this note to Paris tomorrow evening.
  Perhaps it will reach you earlier that way. . . . [T]he government here . . . to
  publish the Homme Libre. I will start tomorrow. The paper will be printed at Toulouse.<br><br>"I
  have . . . with me Madeleine whose son is at Verdun. She spends the days looking
  after the wounded who are in great need . . . . I see her but for a moment in the
  evening. I have tried . . . to get in touch with George. Impossible! . . . [O]ne
  voice for the magnificent attitude of the English. . . . Our military preparation
  was not what it should have been . . . . There are deceptions. . . . The stand taken
  by the three allies never to wage war separately is, in my eyes, the gage for an
  assured victory. At any rate, one will not find in France a government that will
  make any proposals for peace. . . . Our unhappy country will suffer as long as will
  be necessary, but it will not sell out. . . . The public spirit here is admirable.
  I have never seen our people that way.<br><br>"Mary and her mother are at St. Jean
  de Luz . . . . The Germans seem at the end of their strength. The English and the
  French have prevented them from passing the Marne. Perhaps Paris will be cleared.
  . . . I know that you have courage. I will have it too."<br><br>In late August of
  1914, as the Germans advanced toward the city, Paris scrambled its defenses and
  moved the government to Bordeaux. Clemenceau, who had been publishing his newspaper,
  L''Homme libre, in Paris since 1913, ceased operations in early September 1914 when
  the government began censoring the paper. After moving his office to Bordeaux and
  engaging a press in Toulouse, he renamed the paper L''Homme enchaîné and resumed
  publishing.'
