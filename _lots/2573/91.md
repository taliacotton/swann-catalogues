FOOTNOTE: At the end of March 1928, Calvin Coolidge dismissed the Attorney General
  who held the same position in the Harding administration, Harry M. Daugherty, because
  of his alleged--and never substantiated--involvement in the "Teapot Dome" scandal.
  The Teapot Dome Oil Field in WY was one of the government-owned fields leased by
  Secretary of the Interior Albert Bacon Fall to private companies in 1922. It was
  discovered that Fall was accepting bribes in exchange for arranging the lucrative
  leases, and he was sentenced to prison.
