FOOTNOTE: "\"Mr Koussevitzky has been asked by the French Government to arrange a program of American music to be given in Paris between March 10 and 15 at the Conservatoire. He is very anxious that the 'Salon Mexico' be included on that program. I told him I would write to ask you to do your utmost to have a set of parts and score sent to the Paris Conservatory in time for the concert. May I suggest that you write directly to the Conductor of the Concerts du Conservatoire and, if possible, arrange it. The concert will undoubtedly get much attention in the Paris press.\""
