FOOTNOTE: '". . . I beg you to believe that I foresaw infinite good in getting rid
  of Davis as a prisoner and thus enabling those who have been Rebels to become in
  effect Republicans without seeming to betray their late leader. I can afford to
  stand the ''howl''; for I can hear beyond it."<br><br>Greeley''s views about the
  injustice of slavery and his support of the Lincoln administration in its conduct
  of the Civil War was widely known, which is why many were shocked and outraged that,
  when Jefferson Davis had been captured after the close of the War and held in prison
  without trial, Greeley advocated for his release (or for a speedy trial). Greeley
  held that constitutional rights are the same for all, including Davis, and moreover
  that showing leniency toward the former Rebels would help reduce resentment and
  the probability of further rebellion.'
