FOOTNOTE: '"I am happy to be able to satisfy your desire to know my opinion about
  the controversy which exists between the President of the United States and the
  majority of the Congress. . . .<br><br>"Yes, for us friends of the American union
  who feared briefly for its unity in the gigantic struggle which you have just ended
  so successfully, the importance of the vote for the colored race is lessened in
  comparison to the danger of new dissentions.<br><br>"As members of the human fraternity,
  we make no distinction of race whatsoever. So we applauded the selection which the
  magnanimous population of Massachusetts made in the person of two colored representatives
  . . . and we applaud any such proofs from a country where liberty and progress are
  not empty words.<br><br>"However, what we desire above all is that the more or less
  warm harmony which today prevails . . . be not at all troubled, and that . . . [Americans]
  trample underfoot every kind of individual prejudice in order to maintain intact
  the unity of the great Republic, the most powerful symbol of liberty in the world.<br><br>"Therefore
  let your President reach an understanding with the Congress; let there be no more
  dissent between the States . . . ."<br><br>In a series of confrontations between
  the Republican-controlled Congress and the Democratic president Andrew Johnson that
  culminated in his impeachment (and acquittal) in 1868, Johnson repeatedly resisted
  the efforts of Reconstructionists to restore rights to the formerly enslaved, including
  vetoing the Freedmen''s Bureau bill in February and the Civil Rights Act in April
  of 1866.'
