FOOTNOTE: '"You, my two eldest, have written a book after my own heart. You know that;
  for you know that I have thwarted all attempts to separate me from the German emigrants
  and to give me a separate, questionable position among them, that I have emphasized
  my relationship to them, and that for years I did so because I did not want the
  rulers of Germany to hesitate any longer to ''expatriate'' me too,--as they had
  already ''expatriated'' you and my brother. They did not hesitate longer.<br><br>"Your
  book is a book of solidarity on which I then insisted. Let it be a solidarity not
  alone in suffering and in pride, but in guilt as well. German freedom and the Weimar
  republic have been destroyed; we, you and I, are not altogether guiltless in that
  matter--though surely we may disclaim any part or lot in the degradation and shame
  which ensued. Mistakes were made, of omission and commission; that we cannot deny.
  The spiritual leaders of the Republic did not err, perhaps, on the side of the spirit;
  but they did so in the matter of leadership and the consciousness of their responsibility.
  Freedom is sometimes compromised . . . . Freedom is complex, it is delicate--far
  more delicate than force. . . . We German intellectuals were new to freedom, we
  were politically very young and inexperienced--as young as you were then in actual
  years.<br><br>". . . Knowing the deep soundness of your natures, I have always interpreted
  the hatred displayed toward you, my children, and that toward myself, as a sign
  . . . of the wicked brainlessness of the rising tide of brutality in Germany. Now,
  in your growing strength . . . I can trace an equal progress, political and social,
  which the German spirit made by its very banishment. . . ."<br><br>Published in
  Erika and Klaus Mann''s Escape to Life (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1939) 76-77.<br><br>Thomas
  Mann is perhaps best known by those outside Germany as a leader of the literary
  movement formed by German intellectuals exiled by the rise of the Nazi regime. When
  Mann read the manuscript of the book written by two of his children on the subject
  of the culture being generated by these exiles, Escape to Life, Mann wrote his reactions
  in a letter to the authors, who then inserted into the book an English translation
  of the letter to introduce a chapter on their father.'
