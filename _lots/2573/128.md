Many writers have written about me whom I never have met and mostly they have given quite a wrong picture of my person. I think it would be wiser to write about my music only and not about myself.<br><br>\"I never knew Oscar Strauss, the operetta composer. But the great Johann Strauss I met in Vienna and Richard Strauss I of course knew quite well.\""
