FOOTNOTE: '"Now that the battle is ''lost and won''--there is always loss in such
  battles as these--allow me to express once more my thankfulness to you and to Miss
  [Georgina] Hogarth for all the trouble you have so kindly taken to redeem the honour
  of a man who was a perfect stranger to you and had not the least claim to your help.
  . . . I would have gladly given up--when I watched Miss Hogarth''s feelings in the
  witness box--all my individual concerns. . . .<br><br>". . . I send along with this
  an address of ours to the Swiss Central Government and a little Italian book on
  the two brothers Bandiera and their fellow martyrs at Cosenza. Writing as you are
  on Italy, you will, perhaps, like to get more acquainted with some of our ''slaughtered
  saints''."<br><br>Toward the end of 1845, a man impersonating Giuseppe Mazzini solicited
  and received money from Charles Dickens, who was supportive of various laudable
  causes for which Mazzini had become known among the British public. In 1846, the
  man was caught, whereupon Dickens invited Mazzini to dine with him. Later, Mazzini
  gave Dickens a tour of the school for Italian boys he founded at Clerkenwell in
  London.'
