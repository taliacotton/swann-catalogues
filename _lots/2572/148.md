TYPESET: "Watercolor on paper.  645x510 mm; 25½x20⅛ inches.  Signed in pencil, lower right.<br><br>Ex-collection private collection, New Jersey.<br><br>Lechay (1907-2001), having little formal art instruction, is generally considered a self-taught artist.  He worked for the Easel Project, part of the WPA during the Great Depression; his early works are imbued with the Social Realist style of this era.  Though he was in the same circle as Mark Rothko (1903-1970) and Jackson Pollock (1912-1956), and appreciated their pure abstraction, Lechay never completely strayed from representational art.  Nevertheless some works in his <I>œuvre</i> like the current watercolor explore the psychology of tonality with a nod toward Rothko's abstraction."
