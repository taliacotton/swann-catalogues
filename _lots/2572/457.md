He lived and worked around the world, including the United States and Morocco, before returning to Portugal to work as an artist.  He has employed sculpture, film, installation and painting, with the body central to his work.  Often rendered in androgynous and simplified forms, the bodies he depicts reflect on desire and intimacy as well as the possessive aspect of the male gaze."
