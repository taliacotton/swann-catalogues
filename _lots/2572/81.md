  lower right recto.<br><br>Ex-collection Harriet Lyons, Portland, Oregon. <br><br>Ohlson
  (1936-2010) was born in Cherokee, Iowa. He attended Bethel College, completed a
  tour of duty with the United States Marines, then enrolled at the University of
  Minnesota where he graduated in 1961 with a degree in studio art.  He promptly moved
  to New York where he started his career as an artist and initially came under the
  influence of Abstract Expressionism.  His mature, mid-career work, with its hard-edged
  geometric compositions, explored the relationship between colors (see lots 206 and
  207).  From 1964 onward, he exhibited his work consistently in New York, including
  the Museum of Modern Art’s 1968 exhibition "The Art of the Real: 1948-1968" that
  explored the recent history of geometric art in the United States.'
