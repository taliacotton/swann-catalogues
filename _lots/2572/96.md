DESCRIPT: RUTH FRANCKEN
CROSSHEAD: Untitled, No. 254 (Burning Point Series).
TYPESET: Watercolor, gouache and charcoal on heavy white wove paper, 1987.  1000x700
  mm; 39½x27¾ inches.  Dated and annotated "No. 254" in pencil, verso.  With the "Salon
  Ruth Francken" estate ink stamp, verso.<br><br>Born in Prague and exiled in Vienna
  during the interwar years, Francken (1924-2006) studied painting with Arthur Segal
  from 1939-40 at the Ruskin School in Oxford, England, and lived in New York from
  1940 to 1950 (she became an American citizen in 1942), taking classes at the Art
  Students League, before settling in Paris in 1952.  Francken is generally considered
  an Abstract Expressionist artist, though her later work also focused on sculpture,
  collage of different textiles with related techniques and furniture design.  Her
  work from the late 1960s to the early 1970s is marked by an obsession with technology,
  as developed in her series of photo-metallic reliefs and collages.  While sometimes
  included among the Pop artists for these 1960s/1970s works, the over-arching interest
  of much of her creative output is the association of industrial language and its
  conflictual relationship with fine art.
