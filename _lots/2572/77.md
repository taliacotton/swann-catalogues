A very good impression with vibrant colors.<br><br>Ackermann (1887-1975) studied under the Belgian Art Noveau master Henry van de Velde (1863-1957) and later trained in Dresden (with Franz van Stuck, 1863-1928) and Stuttgart.  In Munich, early in his career, Ackermann was a member of <I>Der Blaue Reiter</i> from 1918-19 and exhibited with Kandinsky in the 1920s.  During the late 1920s, he spent time in Paris, where he became friends with Piet Mondrian (1906-1944).  Ackermann was deemed a degenerate artist by the Nazi government in 1933 and was forbidden from teaching and exhibiting; most of his works were also confiscated and destroyed.  Nevertheless, he retreated to the countryside and continued his abstract work at Hornstaad on Lake Constance, which became a thriving artists' colony.  After World War II, Ackermann resettled in Stuttgart and became among the leading mid-century abstract artists in Germany."
