After receiving his MFA from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1965, Alpert began to exhibit locally and in New York.  His work was often experimental, as he tried different pigment formulations and drying methods.  Alpert secluded himself from the art world in the late 1980s, shunning the commercial galleries, and instead taught painting at the Cooper-Union School of Art in New York."
