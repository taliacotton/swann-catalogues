  recto.<br><br>Ex-collection Harriet Lyons, Portland, Oregon.<br><br>Neel (1900-1984)
  is known as one of the premier American portrait artists of the 20th century for
  her images of family, friends, lovers, fellow artists and others, filled with psychological
  acumen and emotional intensity.  Born in Pennsylvania, she studied at the Philadelphia
  School of Design for Women in the early 1920s where she realized her affinitiy for
  portraiture.  In 1932, she moved to New York after a brief period living in Havana,
  Cuba.  During the 1930s she worked for the WPA, but struggled to support herself
  as an artist during the first nearly three decades of her career. As Abstract Expressionism
  surged to popularity during the 1950s, Neel rejected artistic trends and remained
  committed to portraiture in her characteristic expressive style.  Around 1960 she
  began gaining recognition for her work, and her career flourished with the advent
  and support of the women''s rights movement in the late 1960s and 1970s.  By 1974
  she was the subject of a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum of Art Art, New
  York, and she continues to be recognized as a major figure in 20th Century American
  art.<br><br>Neel was interested in subjects of different socio-economic and cultural
  backgrounds and her sitters ranged from the elite, such as art critic and Museum
  of Modern art curator Frank O''Hara, to her neighbors in Spanish Harlem.  In the
  current work, she depicts Harriet Lyons, a founding editor of <I>Ms. Magazine</i>,
  journalist, and art collector.  By 1970, Lyons had been involved with a consciousness-raising
  group of art professionals, which included curators, artists and art historians.  In
  1971, she wrote a cover story for the <I>Village Voice</i> about women''s sexuality
  in art at a time when women were starting to challenge male definitions of art.  A
  leading figure in the feminist movement, she supported female artists through her
  writing, personal art collection and activism, which included being a member of
  the Board of Advisors to the New York Feminist Art Institute alongside Alice Neel
  that launched in 1979.<br><br>Lyons recalled, in a 2005 Feminist Art Institute interview,
  "I wrote a cover story for the <I>Village Voice</i> about women''s sexuality in
  art, women artists exploring sexual and female imagery. The whole idea and question
  of a unique female imagery has been posed.  This was a time of guerilla tactics
  and street theater to break down barriers to women’s equality. Female artists were
  talking about where they were coming from and what their work was about. While these
  discussions could get heated, it never escalated to the behavior I had witnessed
  among male artists in the ‘60s, especially at post-openings loft parties.  Liquored
  up, these guys would invariably come to blows arguing about art (and who was flirting
  with whose wife or girlfriend).  The point is that women, too, had strong theories
  about art, and in the ’70s were finally raising their voices against the male definitions
  of art and the separation of fine art and craft (any work made by a woman that involved
  stitchery was ''craft'').  Women were making huge breakthroughs and expressions
  in their art specific to women.  The whole question of a woman''s imagery was hotly
  debated.  Clearly, the time had come to publicly address the male biases in art-making
  and how artists were educated.  To that end, two members of our consciousness-raising
  group were behind pioneering institutions: The New Museum of Contemporary Art, founded
  by Marcia Tucker in 1977, and the New York Feminist Art Institute, spearheaded by
  Nancy Azara and launched in 1979.  The latter came out of long, probing discussions
  of women''s experiences in art education and the studio.  Those who were trained
  at the Art Students League, School of Visual Artists, Parsons, RISD, the Philadelphia
  School of Art, all had similar experiences about how rigid the sense of what art
  was, what the techniques were, what the imagery was.  They all expressed being very
  much reined in by this overwhelming male model.  They never had female teachers.  The
  only women they saw were models or other female students."'
