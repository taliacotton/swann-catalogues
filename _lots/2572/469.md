TYPESET: "Color aquatint and etching on Zerkall paper, 2004.  197x145 mm; 7⅞x5¾ inches, full margins.  Signed and dated in pencil, lower right.  Proofed by the artist and Fritze Margull, Port of Spain, Trinidad and printed by Fritze Margull, Berlin.  Published by Griffelkunst, Hamburg.  From <I>Black Palms</i>.  A superb impression with vibrant colors.<br><br>According to the artist, the <I>Black Palms</i> series, \"Came about whilst working with the printer Fritze Margull. He came down to Port of Spain, Trinidad where I have set up house and studio. We built a small make shift studio in the corner of a large warehouse space--we had a small table top press that we used to proof the plates with. The images for the etchings for the most part are relatively new ones for me although I have made some drawings, and water colours using similar imagery.  I am in the process of using the images to make larger scale paintings now.  I have found that making etchings prior to making paintings is a useful way to familiarize myself with the subject and imagery,\" (Griffelkunst).  Doig (born 1959) notes that the compositions for many of the images were actually derived from a set of old postcards he'd bought in London showing various Indian scenes, which he in turn combined with his Trinidad experiences.  In the case of <I>Pelican</i>, \"The figure dragging the dead pelican was dragging a fishing net in the Indian post card--I saw a man killing and dragging a pelican along a beach here [Trinidad]; dinner,\" (Griffelkunst)."
