  (1913-2009), born in France, emigrated to the United States in 1925.  After working
  as a commerical artist, she decided to pursue painting full time.  She studied at
  the Cooper-Union School of Art, the Art Students League, and at the short-lived
  Subjects of the Artists School, under Willem de Kooning, Hans Hofmann, Robert Motherwell
  and Mark Rothko.  Thomas exhibited with the New York School at the legendary 1951
  Ninth Street Show.   In her gestural works, she conveyed her emotions, memories
  and natural spirit through the use of sweeping color and bold brushstrokes.  Throughout
  her career, she experimented with many styles, from action painting to geometric,
  solid planes of color.  Thomas is now widely recognized as being at the forefront
  of the Abstract Expressionism movement in New York.
