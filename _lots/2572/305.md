  New York, 1988.<br><br>The "Computers and Art" exhibition was a groundbreaking event,
  described by one critic as, "A circus-like extravaganza of visual and aural effects
  . . . at the IBM Gallery of Science and Art.  Everything from a water sculpture
  that responds to both programmed music and hand-clapping, to a drawing machine that
  creates images of plants and people, can be seen and experimented with in ''Computers
  and Art,'' a truly fascinating exhibition devoted to the computer and its importance
  in the making of art today.  There are 141 works in all, including several collaborative
  pieces, by more than 150 painters, sculptors, architects, and video artists, all
  of whom have utilized computers at some point in the creative process.  These works
  represent almost every stylistic approach, from traditional oil paintings to ''high-tech''
  video and 3-D ''synthetic'' images, and include examples by, among others, Andy
  Warhol, Philip Pearlstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Larry Rivers, and Kenneth Noland."'
