  the same-titled, three-part work painted by Bacon (1909-1992) from 1974 to 1977.  This
  mysterious work, one of the last in a series of triptychs that Bacon painted following
  the suicide of his long-time companion, George Dyer, in 1971 (Dyer killed himself

  of a landmark retrospective of Bacon's work at the Grand Palais), is believed to
