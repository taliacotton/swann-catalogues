A very good impression.<br><br>According to Harrison, in the four screenprints in this series, \"Frankenthaler manipulated the same image, varying the colors of the lower loop and thereby changing the way in which the lines and forms are perceived in relationship to one another.  Moreover, by working with a small area of drawn image that opens up and outward on a large sheet, she achieved strong play between the densely saturated colors and the negative space in which they are so precariously balanced.  The surface is further activated by the inverted V-image, drawn with crayon skipping across the fine mesh of the screen.\"  Harrison 25."
