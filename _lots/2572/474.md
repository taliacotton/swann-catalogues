  was located in Chelsea, New York, at 516 A Â½ West 20th Street from 2002-2005.  The
  location satirized the lavishness and glitz of contemporary exhibition spaces. The
  Wrong Gallery measured only two-and-a-half square meters, and though it never actually
  opened, "visitors" could peer through the glass front door at rotating "exhibitions"
  that featured programming conceptualized by Cattelan, Subotnick and Gioni.  Another
  replica of The Wrong Gallery has since reopened, even smaller at only one square
  meter, at the Tate Modern, London.
