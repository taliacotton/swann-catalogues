  (1937-2004) rhythmic and colorful sculptures of animalistic forms draw on the artist's
  memories and knowledge of traditional West African sculpture and spiritualism.  They
  are constructed to convey the potential for movement and at the same time, stability
  by being anchored by a solid base.
