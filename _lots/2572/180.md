Rickey furthered his artistic training, at the advice of his father, a Singer Sewing Machine Company executive, in Paris at the <I>Académie L'Hote</i> and <I>Académie Moderne</i>, studying modern painting and drawing.  He returned to the U.S. in 1930 and began the first in a series of art teaching positions before he was drafted and served in the U.S. Army Air Force (1942-45).

He left his teaching position at Muhlenberg College the following year and focused his work on sculpture from the 1950s onward, settling with his family to East Chatham, New York, by 1960, and ultimately becoming among the leading kinetic sculptors of the 20th century."
