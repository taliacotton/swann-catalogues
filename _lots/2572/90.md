TYPESET: "Oil on canvas, circa 1960.  1070x1275 mm; 42x50 inches.  Signed and annotated in ink, verso, and with the artist's printed label, verso.<br><br>Ex-collection World House Galleries Corp., New York, with the label; private collection, New Jersey.<br><br>Lovet-Lorski (1894-1973) is primarily known for his Art Deco sculpture and portrait busts, though he also practiced printmaking, drawing and painting where it related to his scultpural works during his early career.  Lovet-Lorski developed arthritis in the late 1930s which worsened with age; in the late 1950s he could no longer raise his arms above his head.  With his sculptural output diminished, he turned to painting.  His late-career abstract paintings, like the current work, echo the mythological and fantasy subject matter of his Art Deco works while channelling the artist's \"innermost self,\" his memories, and his interest in natural beauty."
