Signed and dated in oil, verso.<br><br>Ex-collection the artist's estate, New York; private collection, New Jersey.<br><br>A career economist, Ethe (born 1924) collected artworks by Fernand Léger, Kurt Schwitters, Paul Klee, Joseph Cornell, and leading Post-Impressionist artists, occasionally lending to The Museum of Modern Art, New York.  Ethe started to create his own art in the 1960s, drawing inspiration from his own collection—non-representational forms with the gestural qualities of Léger paired with the experimental color theories and vibrations of Piet Mondrian and Kasimir Malevich."
