She was a co-founder of the Munich group \"ZEN 49\" in 1949, a member of the Deutscher Künstlerbund and also worked as a studio assistant for the British modernist sculptor Henry Moore (1898-1986) and the Russian-French constructivist sculptor Antoine Pevsner (1884-1962).   She met Martin Matschinsky (born 1921) in 1952 at the Darmstadt-based experimental theater of Gustav Rudolf Sellner, where Meier-Denninghoff worked as a scenographer and Matschinsky as an actor.  The couple married in 1959 and started working together, primarily in sculpture.  The same year, they exhibited their collaborative work at \"II. documenta\" in Kassel and received the Prix Bourdelle Award.  During the 1960s, the couple developed their characteristic technique of elegant shimmering, curved, chromium-nickel tubes that were set together in bundles, seemingly weightless, as monumental outdoor sculptures."
