  Gerson, New York; Marlborough-Gerson Gallery, New York; Marlborough Gallery, New
  York; private collection, New York.<br><br>Avramidis (1922-2016) was a Greek-Austrian
  sculptor who studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna from 1945-49 and
  sculpture at Fritz Wotrubas' (1907-1975) sculpture classes from 1953-56.  He was
  inspired by classical antiquity and Italian Renaissance sculpture, which greatly
  valued a figure's proportions.  Avramidis blended abstraction with figuration often
  creating forms with heightened texture and sensuality.  He noted of his work, “My
  work demonstrates the execution of an objective, that is to say, of a perfectly
  graspable form. This form is the primary prerequisite for creating a work of art.  In
  this I try to remove any personal stylistic influences from my work.  The only real
  references in my work are to Antiquity and Early Italian Renaissance.”
