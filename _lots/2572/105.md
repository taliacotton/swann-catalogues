A very good impression.<br><br>According to Reddy (1925-2018), \"I was inspired by Beethoven’s “Pastorale” to work this plate. The power of the music exploded into an extraordinary space embedded with shapes. In the skeleton of interwoven structures, strange forms and shapes emerged which I tried to perfect by carving with scrapers and burins. The more I worked the more dynamic the landscape became\" (<I>Krishna Reddy: A Retrospective</i>, Bronx Museum of the Arts, New York, 1981, 67-68)."
