He moved to New York where he began an artistic career that focused on abstraction, rejecting the artistic trends of the time such as Pop Art of Neo-Expressionism, to further explore how abstraction could incorporate texture as well as color.  In the 1970s, he found his distinctive style composed of unconventional shapes with bold but simple color palettes."
