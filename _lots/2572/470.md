TYPESET: "Digital pigment print on Somerset Radiant White Velvet 330gsm paper, 2020.  1280x970 mm; 50½x38¼ inches (sheets), full margins.  Signed, dated and numbered 21/123 in pencil, lower right.  Published by the Vienna Secession, Association of Visual Artists, Vienna, Austria.  A superb impression of this large print with vibrant colors.<br><br>Doig (born 1959) exhibited two paintings from his recent \"Bather\" theme at the Vienna Sucession in 2019, one of which is the basis for this print.  The images are a homage to the American modernist painter, Marsden Hartley (1877-1943), though Doig has utilized a photograph of Robert Mitchum on a beach in Trinidad (where the artist currently lives and works).  Mitchum is nearly unrecognizable in Doig's representation, a dark moonlit sea and a nude, kneeling woman to his right adding an air of mystery to the scene."
