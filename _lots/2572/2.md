TYPESET: "Color etching and aquatint on Fabriano paper, 1971.  610x453 mm; 24x17â…ž inches, full margins.  Signed, dated and numbered 44/65 in pencil, lower margin.  A very good impression of this scarce print with strong colors.  <br><br>According to Associated American Artists, \"While the discs pulsate in the upper portion of the Bursts, configurations of brush strokes erupt below.  Deeply bitten arc-like surfaces of the brush strokes . . . suggest a more unpredictable and violent action than the glowing pulsations of the discs . . .  Gottlieb (1903-1974) posits two vital and opposing forces.  And while each has the potential to subsume the other, he has discovered a unifying structure that allows them to function in a relationship of complementary equilibrium.\"  Associated American Artists 66."
