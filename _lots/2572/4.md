pullquote: '"Dehner (1901-1994) studied for several years at the Art Students League
  and there met the American modernist sculptor David Smith, whom she married in 1940.  She
  explored more progressive art forms similar to Smith''s interests, adhering to abstract
  and cubist tendencies rather than representational imagery.  The couple moved to
  Bolton Landing, in upstate New York, where, gradually Dehner''s art became secondary
  to her duties as a wife (her painting series ''Life on the Farm'' and a group of
  black ink drawings she called the ''Damnation Series,'' mid-1940s, serves as a psychological
  reflection of the mundanity of her life then).  Their marriage was deteriorating
  at Bolton Landing; they separated in 1950 and divorced a year later.  Subsequently,
  Dehner fully resumed her career as an artist, studying printmaking at Atelier 17
  and returning to painting and sculpture with renewed creative energy."  '
