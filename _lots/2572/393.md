Signed, titled and dated in ink, verso.<br><br>Ex-collection private collection, New York.<br><br>Seawright (born 1936) was born in Jackson, Mississippi and from a young age was fascinated by machines and creating objects by hand. He joined the Navy where he continued to learn about machinery and technology, skills he would later put to use in his sculpture.  He moved to New York in 1961, scouring the streets for electronic items that he could use in his interactive sculptures.  Seen as a pioneer of kinetic and electric sculpture, he often incorporated mirrors and electronic parts into his sculpture.  His work is held in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and The Museum of Modern Art, New York, among others."
