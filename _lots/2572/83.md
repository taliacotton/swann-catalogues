Signed and dated in oil, lower right recto.<br><br>Ex-collection Otto Gerson, New York; Marlborough-Gerson Gallery, New York; Marlborough Gallery, New York; private collection, New York.<br><br>Moller (1905-2000) was born in Germany and emigrated to the United States in 1936 where he worked as an artist and graphic designer.   In the 1940s Moller was among the many artists who turned to abstraction.  Moller's version of Abstract Expressionism was rooted in the spiritualism of color, much like Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944).   During the late 1950s Moller divided his time between New York and the artist colony on Monhegan Island, Maine.  The island provided a natural, dramatic backdrop for Moller's luminous, richly-colored paintings of patterned and abstract landscapes."
