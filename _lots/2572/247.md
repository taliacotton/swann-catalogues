  of nine limited edition screenprints, including Chanel (Feldman 354), which depicts
  the company's iconic perfume bottle against a two-colored background.  In 1997,
  the company revisited this image to use in an advertising campaign.  The resulting
  posters exist in two sizes. This is the larger format, intended for use in French
