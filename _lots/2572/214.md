  Marisol's (Marisol Escobar, 1930-2016) work let the artist appropriate different
  female identities, usually drawn from upper and middle class gender roles.  She
  was described as an "enigma" in the press throughout her career, nevertheless the
  majority of her sculptural <I>œuvre</i>, like the current works, used casts of her
  own face.  Bridging artistic movements and avoiding style-defining characterization,
  Marisol mimicked the imaginary construct of what it means to be a woman, as well
  as the role of the 'artist,' utilizing the spontaneous gesture of expression of
  Action Painting along with the cool and collected artistic intent of Pop Art.
