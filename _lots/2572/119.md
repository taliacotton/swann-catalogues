TYPESET: 'Steel sculpture, 1961.  770x525x230 mm; 30½x20¾x9¼ inches (including base).  With
  the artist''s initials and dated "1961-10" on the upper side of the base.<br><br>Ex-collection
  private collection, Chicago. <br><br>Published Donadio, "Miracle in the Scrap Heap:
  The Sculpture of Richard Stankiewicz," Addison Gallery of American Art at the Phillips
  Academy, Andover, Massachusetts, 2003, page 39 (illustrated).<br><br>According to
  Donadio, describing Stankiewicz''s work from the beginning of the 1960s, "He made
  heads that took the Urchin form, a section of cylindrical pipe, which he treated
  like a tunnel and filled with assorted discards of hardware.  But at the same time
  he made two-faced Janus heads, sculptures with two primary surfaces and exaggerated
  facial expressions.  With their grotesque and scary facial features, these <I>stelae</i>
  often bore names like <I>Double Booger for a Little John</i>, or <I>The Suicide</i>.  The
  first of these was later described as a "spirit trap" for a person the artist detested.  The
  latter may have been a meditation on the death of Ernest Hemingway, whose suicide
  was front-page news in the summer of 1961.  The contrast between his untitled and
  his named works was becoming extreme."'
