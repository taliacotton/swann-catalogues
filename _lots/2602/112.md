A very good impression with heavy plate tone.<br><br>There are similar impressions of this subject, also printed with heavy plate tone, for the 18th century Amsterdam collector Jean de Bary, who owned the copper etching plate for this portrait and some 28 additional Rembrandt plates, at the Kunstsammlung der Veste, Coburg; the British Museum, London; and the State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg.  According to Hinterding and Rutgers, \"The sale catalogue of the estate of Jean de Bary, a jeweller and art dealer, sheds light on a sizeable number of posthumous impressions of Rembrandt's etchings with heavy, irregular plate tone.  When de Bary dies in Amsterdam in 1759, he had in his possession twenty-nine original copper plates by Rembrandt and one copy.\"<br><br>Provenance: Probably Jean de Bary (died 1759), Amsterdam; Gustav Friedrich Konstantin Parthey, Berlin (Lugt 2014, verso); the Duke of Buccleuch, London and Dalkeith (Lugt 402, verso).
