TYPESET: "Etching and drypoint, 1663.  720x475 mm; 28Â½x19 inches, wide margins.  Second state (of 2), an early impression in this state with the added drypoint distinct, with strong contrasts and little to no sign of wear.<br><br>According to Wallace, \"Rosa (1615-1673) clearly borrowed the overall composition of [Bartolomeo Coriolano's, 1599-1676, same-titled woodcut, a piled up, cone-like mass of intermingled boulders and bodies capped with clouds surrounding the flying figure of Zeus.  In addition the figure supporting a boulder at the lower right corner of Rosa's etching and the very similar running figure at the center of the lower left corner of the [chiaroscuro woodcut] print are both very like the rock-bearing figure near the left center of the woodcut.\"  Bartsch 21; Wallace 115."
