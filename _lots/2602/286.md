TYPESET: "Color lithograph on  Chine volant , 1899. 510x355 mm; 20⅛x14 inches (sheet), full margins. Second state (of 2). Edition of approximately 112. Printed by Stern, Paris. Published by Pierrefort, Paris. A superb impression of this scarce lithograph with strong colors.<br><br>Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901) created this lithograph (also published in an edition of approximately 100 in black), along with three other equestrian racing subjects, while undergoing treatment at a private psychiatric hospital at Neuilly for his worsening health, hallucinations and severe depression. These were likely intended to be published altogether as a larger series, as suggested by the printer Stern, but the project never came to fruition as a result of the artist's sickness. Delteil 279; Adhémar 365; Adriani 345."
