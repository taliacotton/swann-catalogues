From  Im Schatten .  A very good impression of this scarce print.<br><br>Grosz's (1893-1959) portfolio  Im Schatten  (In the Shadows) focuses on the lives of Weimar Germany's forgotten citizens: the toiling proletariat and crippled veterans who enjoyed none of the glittering pleasures of the postwar metropolis.  Grosz presents the monotonous lives of the workers sympathetically, reserving his usual scathing caricature for fat capitalists, petit-bourgeois philistines and pompous army officers.  Workers, war invalids and impoverished mothers and widows go about their lives in tattered clothing with quiet dignity.  Grosz humanizes the workers, carefully giving each a unique physiognomy and gait, even as they head  en masse  to the factory.  The title of this work,  Ameisen  (or Ants), alludes to the monotonous routine of these men on their way to work.  Dückers MIV I."
