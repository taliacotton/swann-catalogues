TYPESET: "Etching and drypoint, 1636.  158x136 mm; 6¼x5½ inches, thread margins.  Usticke's first state (e) (of 4), with the toe of the boot at the far right still complete; New Hollstein's first state (of 3).  Double-headed eagle with letters ID and crozier watermark (similar to Hinterding subvariant C.a.a., which he dates from 1632-37).  A superb, early impression, with very strong contrasts and no wear in the densely cross-hatched areas to the right of the son's nose, and with the faint landscape and buildings in the left background distinct, with the deposits of ink in the lower right corner and partially inky upper left plate edges, consistent with the earliest impressions of this subject.  Bartsch 91; Biörklund 36-D; Hollstein (White and Boon) 91; New Hollstein 159."
