DESCRIPT: PIETER BRUEGEL (AFTER)
CROSSHEAD: " The Wedding of Mopsus and Nisa (The Dirty Bride) ."
TYPESET: Engraving, 1570.  223x289 mm; 9x11Â½ inches, narrow margins.  Second state
  (of 5), with the address of Hieronymus Cock (additionally with the inscription "Heronimo
  Koko excuto" by an early hand in ink, lower left recto).  Engraved by Pieter van
  der Heyden.  Indiscernible sphere (?) watermark.  A superb, early, richly-inked
  impression of this very scarce engraving, with strong contrasts and no sign of wear.<br><br>According
  to Bassens and Van Grieken, this scene is based on an early Shrove Tuesday play
  and can also be seen in Bruegel's popular 1559 oil painting  The Battle between
  Carnaval and Lent .  They note, "Sixteenth century folk culture included an extensive
  repertoire of popular games and plays performed in the period around Shrove Tuesday.  The
  subject matter often related to the 'driving out' or 'fleeing' of winter.  For the
  most part, it is hard to work out nowadays precisely how these plays were performed,
  and we are equally ignorant as to their content, since a great many of the texts
  have failed to survive.  The story of  The Dirty Bride ('Vuyl Bruyt')  seems to
  hark back to an earlier variation, in which a 'vuyle druyt' or 'dirty vagrant' personifying
  winter was driven out of a hedge to herald spring.  Over time, the figure changed
  sex, until spring was announced by the first call of the cuckoo and the dirty bride
  leaving her ramshackle home."  Hollstein 80; Bastelaer 216; Lebeer 80; Bassens and
  Van Grieken 22.
