TYPESET: "Etching, after 1560.  337x446 mm; 13½x17½ inches.  Three crescents watermark.  With thread margins or trimmed on the plate mark.  A very good impression of this extremely scarce etching.<br><br>Formerly attributed to Titian himself (1485/90-1576), this image has subsequently been considered the work of the Venetian printmaker Battista Franco (circa 1510-1561), though more recent scholarship by Zoltán Kárpáti, Curator of Italian Drawing and Prints, Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest, has disputed the attribution to Battista Franco and pointed to a still unknown Venetian printmaker, following a design by Titian ( An Undescribed Version of \"Landscape with a Horseman and his Groom\" after Titian), Bulletin du Musée Hongrois des Beaux-Arts, 2013, pages 101-107).  The current etching shows the subject illustrated in Bartsch (as Battista Franco) with the composition in reverse.  See Bartsch 8."
