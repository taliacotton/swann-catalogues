A brilliant, richly-inked, early impression of this very scarce engraving.<br><br>Delaune (1518-1595) was born in either Paris or Orléans.  He trained as a medalist and worked as a goldsmith in Paris in the 1540s-50s.  In 1552, he was appointed to the royal mint, however, he left this position after just six months following a wage dispute.  Nevertheless, during his employment at the mint, Delaune was able to forge connections with the French court and king allowing him to obtain royal commissions, notably for the design of intricately detailed royal armor, medals and other decorative metalwork.  He was said to have been mentored by the Italian goldsmith and sculptor Benvenuto Cellini (1500-1570), who was at the time living in Paris.  There are six designs by Delaune in the Musée du Louvre, Paris; two of them are for circular dishes representing the stories of Moses and of Samson.  Delaune's engravings, which are generally small, were executed with great dexterity of handling and are very highly finished.  Robert-Dumesnil 282.<br><br>With—CORNELIS CORT.
