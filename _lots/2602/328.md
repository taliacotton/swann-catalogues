A very good impression.<br><br>Patterson (1877-1966) arrived in Hawaii in 1916 while traveling from his native Australia to New York.  Enamored with the beauty of the islands, he decided to stay with a friend in Honolulu rather than continue his trip.  He lived and worked in Hawaii for 18 months, creating numerous prints and paintings of the landscape.  His works were included in the Hawaiian Society of Artists Annual in 1917. Prior to his time in Hawaii, Patterson had studied in Melbourne at the National Gallery Art School and in Paris at the Académie Julian and the Académie Colarossi.  While in Paris, he exhibited at the first Salon d'Automne in 1905.  He eventually settled in Seattle and established the University of Washington School of Painting and Design."
