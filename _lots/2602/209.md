DESCRIPT: JOHN HAMILTON MORTIMER
CROSSHEAD: " Self Portrait in Character ."
TYPESET: 'Etching, circa 1775.  420x305 mm; 16¾x12¼ inches.  Proof before letters,
  with the titled added in pencil in the blank lower margin.  A superb impression.<br><br>According
  to the Royal Collection Trust, London, "This etching corresponds, in reverse, with
  a drawing in the Victoria and Albert Museum, itself a version of an oil by Mortimer
  in the Towner Art Gallery, Eastbourne (Victoria and Albert Museum, E.328–1961; for
  the painting see Sunderland 1986, number 107).  Another etching after the same drawing,
  by Mortimer’s collaborator Robert Blyth and published in 1782, has been claimed
  to be a later state of the present print, but is from a different plate: as well
  as many differences of detail, the tonalities capture none of the dramatic atmosphere
  and stark lighting.  Mortimer did not make many prints, but in 1775–76 he produced
  a set of 12 heads of figures from Shakespeare that have very much the same character
  and technique seen here.  It seems therefore that the present plate was etched by
  Mortimer himself and that Blyth made his own version for publication a few years
  later."<br><br>With—WENZEL HOLLAR.   Pietro Aretino , etching, 1649.  Pennington
