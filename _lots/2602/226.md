DESCRIPT: RODOLPHE BRESDIN
CROSSHEAD: " Le Bon Samaritain ."
TYPESET: Lithograph on two  Chine appliqués , 1861.  564x444 mm; 22¼x17½ inches, full
  margins.  Préaud's first state B (of 2), with the "white bird" lower left and before
  the transfer to another stone in 1868.  Edition of approximately 200 lifetime impressions.  Printed
  by Lemercier, Paris.  Signed and dedicated by the artist's daughter, Rodolphine
  Bresdin, in pencil, lower right.  A superb, richly-inked impression of this important
  lithograph with very strong contrasts and all the details distinct.  <br><br>Lifetime
  impressions, such as the current work, are exceedingly scarce.  There is also a
  more common, posthumous edition of approximately 800 impressions (printed after
  the transfer of the subject to another stone).<br><br>Despite his technically complex
  and highly imaginative printed work, the self-taught Bresdin (1822-1885) remained
  in obscurity and penniless throughout most of his career. Disregarded by many of
  his contemporaries due to his eccentricity, he was referred to as "le chien-caillou"
  ("the stone dog"). Some critics and artists, however, recognized and respected his
  genius, including Victor Hugo and Charles Baudelaire (Bresdin was also Odilon Redon's
  mentor).<br><br>One of the most visionary printmakers since Rembrandt, he was clearly
  a devotee of the master's work, evidenced both in his early engravings and lithographs
  of intimate interior genre scenes and by a comparison of the current work.  Like
  Rembrandt's  The Angel Appearing to the Shepherds , etching, 1634, Bresdin's  tour-de-force  lithograph
  shows a dark landscape rendered by a complex system of densely overlapped lines
  and varied tonalities.  Van Gelder 100; Préaud 29.
