Signed by the artist's widow, Sonia Delaunay, titled and numbered 52/75 in pencil, lower margin.<br><br>Delaunay (1885-1941) chose the view into the ambulatory of the Parisian Gothic church Saint-Séverin as the subject of his first series of groundbreaking modern paintings, from circa 1909, in which he charted the modulations of light streaming through the stained-glass windows and the resulting perceptual distortion of the architecture.  This lithograph is based on a painting from the series; like many of Delaunay's lithographs, only proofs were printed during his brief career, the majority were printed posthumously and authorized by his widow, the artist Sonia Delaunay (1885-1979)."
