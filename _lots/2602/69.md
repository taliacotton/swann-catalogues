TYPESET: "<p>Engraving, 1569. 323x230 mm; 12¾x9¼ inches, thread margins. First state
  (of 2), with the address of Luca Guerinoni. Anchor or cardinal's hat in a circle
  watermark. A superb, richly-inked, early impression of this scarce engraving, with
  very strong contrasts and no sign of wear.<br><br>This is among the earliest engravings
  of Michelangelo's (1475-1564) fresco on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel, which
  took four years for him to complete between 1536 and 1541. Rota (1520-1583) was
  a draughtsman and engraver. He was born in Sabenico, Dalmatia, and was active in
  Rome during the 1540s-1560s, after which he moved to Florence and then Venice. Rota
  used etching and engraving together in his plates and while few original compositions
  are known by his hand, his near-contemporary, meticulously-rendered prints after
  paintings by Italian Renaissance masters were extremely important for the dissemination
  of these images through Europe during the mid to late 1500s. By 1568, Rota was employed
  at the imperial Hapsburg court in Vienna and moved to Prague in the late 1570s when
  Rudolf II relocated the court.<br><br>Provenance: John Postle Heseltine (Lugt 1508,
