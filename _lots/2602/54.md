A brilliant, richly-inked, dark impression with very strong contrasts.<br><br>This engraving is based on another engraving, with the subject in the opposite direction, by Agostino Veneziano (see Bartsch 423).  Both engravings derive from a now lost cartoon for a fresco drawn by Michelangelo (1475-1564) illustrating a scene from the Battle of Cascina (July 28, 1364), which celebrated the Florentine victory of Siena, for a competition against Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) in the  Salone dei Cinquecento  of the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence."
