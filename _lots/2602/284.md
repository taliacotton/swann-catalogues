TYPESET: "Color lithograph on cream wove paper mounted on linen, 1893.  1359x978 mm; 53½x38½ inches (sheet), full margins.  First state (of 2).  Printed and published by Charles Verneau, Paris.  <br><br>Bruant was one of Lautrec's (1864-1901) earliest supporters.  One year after Lautrec designed his first poster for the Moulin Rouge, Bruant recognized the potential that such potent artwork could have for his own career.  The success of their first work (which Bruant had to force on the manager of the Ambassadeurs as he considered it too vulgar) led to many more commissions. This is Lautrec's third poster for the performer.  The broad strokes, flat colors, detailed representation of the singer's face, and the implied arrogance of the performer who would turn his back on his public all served to make this an iconic image. The poster originally appeared without text; when the second edition with text was printed (\"Aristide Bruant dans son Cabaret,\") it was done so by a different printer, Edward Ancourt. Delteil 348; Adhémar 151 I; Adriani 12 I; Wittrock P9 A."
