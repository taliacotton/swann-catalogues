Signed and inscribed \"trial proof\" in pencil, lower margin.  A superb impression of this extremely scarce print.<br><br>After the first 10 printings, Lewis (1881-1962) cut the plate into two sections and reworked both as separate compositions.  There is only one known impression of each of the two smaller second state plates: states IIA and IIB.  The state IIB impression, which was taken from the right side of the plate, is in the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts.<br><br>We have found only one other impression of the complete plate at auction in the past 30 years.  <br><br>Provenance: Patricia Lewis (the artist’s daughter-in-law), with her ink stamp verso.
