Superb, richly-inked impressions with strong contrasts.<br><br>This series was first published by the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, Madrid in 1864 (the second edition appeared in 1875) under the title  Los Proverbios , or Proverbs, previously known only in a handful of early 19th century proofs by Goya (1746-1828).  The series is an enigmatic album of 22 prints (originally 18; 4 works were added later) which is the last major series of prints by Goya, created during the end of his career.  The scenes of the  Disparates , as Goya referred to many of the subjects in the series, which are difficult to explain, include dark, dream-like scenes that scholars have related to political issues, traditional proverbs and the Spanish carnival.  Delteil 202-219; Harris 248-265."
