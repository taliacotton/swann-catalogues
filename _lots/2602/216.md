  255x355 mm; 10x14 inches, narrow to thread margins.  Second edition, with numbers
  and the plates bevelled.  Superb, richly-inked impressions with strong contrasts.<br><br>This
  series was first published by the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, Madrid
  in 1864 (the second edition appeared in 1875) under the title  Los Proverbios ,
  or Proverbs, previously known only in a handful of early 19th century proofs by
  Goya (1746-1828).  The series is an enigmatic album of 22 prints (originally 18;
  4 works were added later) which is the last major series of prints by Goya, created
  during the end of his career.  The scenes of the  Disparates , as Goya referred
  to many of the subjects in the series, which are difficult to explain, include dark,
  dream-like scenes that scholars have related to political issues, traditional proverbs
  and the Spanish carnival.  Delteil 202-219; Harris 248-265.
