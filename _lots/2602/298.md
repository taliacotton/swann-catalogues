  (1864-1944), the artist and friend of Sargent, Southwell, Nottingham; thence by
  descent to William de Belleroche and Gordon Anderson, Brighton; private collection,
  New York.<br><br>Welsh-born artist Albert de Belleroche (1864-1944), credited as
  one of the greatest lithographers of the 20th century, was instrumental in Sargent''s
  (1856-1925) foray into lithography.  The two met in Paris while both studying under
  Carolus-Duran (1837-1917) in 1882.  They created several portraits of each other;
  Sargent''s 1883 oil on canvas portrait of Belleroche, now at the Metropolitan Museum
  of Art, New York, remained in Sargent''s possession throughout his life.  After
  Sargent moved to London following the  Madame X  scandal, he was introduced to lithography
  by Frederick Goulding, and no doubt encouraged by Belleroche.  When in 1905, Belleroche
  asked Sargent to draw his portrait on transfer paper with lithographic crayon to
  accompany an article in the  Gazette des Beaux-Arts , Sargent liked the printed
  proofs from Paris so much so that he and Belleroche arranged for Beatrice Stewart
  to model for the present lithograph.  Dodgson 6.'
