TYPESET: "Etching, circa 1631. 50x42 mm; 2x1¾ inches, narrow to thread margins. Biörklund's third state (of 5), after the reduction of the plate; Usticke's fourth state (of 7); White and Boon's third state (of 5); New Hollstein's fourth state (of 10), before the addition of the line to define the lower left shoulder.  A very good impression of this extremely scarce etching, with strong contrasts. <br><br>According to Usticke, \"An extremely rare, small self portrait, RRR+\" (Usticke illustrates an impression in reverse, which is evidently either a counter proof from the original plate or the reverse copy he notes in his catalogue).<br><br>We have found only 15 other impressions at auction in the past 30 years. Bartsch 319; Biörklund 31-10; Hollstein (White and Boon) 319; New Hollstein 71."
