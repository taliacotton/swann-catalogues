CROSSHEAD: " Old Battersea Bridge. "
TYPESET: "Etching and drypoint printed in dark brownish black on antique, cream laid paper, 1879.  202x293 mm; 8x11Â½ inches (sheet), full margins.  MacDonald's fifth state (of 7),  with the faint butterfly lower right.  Signed with the butterfly and inscribed \"imp.\" in pencil on the tab, lower left.  A very good impression of this scarce etching.<br><br>MacDonald cites approximately 50 impressions of this subject.  We have found fewer than 15 impressions at auction in the past 30 years.<br><br>According to MacDonald, \"Nearly 50 impressions of  Old Battersea Bridge  have been recorded, though not all have been located.  Whistler was expected to print 25 for the Fine Art Society, and Frederick Goulding (1842-1909) was to print the remaining 25.  However, Whistler had not completed the edition before he left for Venice in September 1879.  On his return from Venice he apparently started printing again, and sold 21 impressions to the Fine Art Society on 8 April 1881.  This actually suggests that Whistler decided to print them all himself.\"  Kennedy 177; Glasgow 188."
