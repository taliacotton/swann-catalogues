Both very good impressions, scarce with the pair.<br><br>According to Bromberg, \"No record exists of their ever having been printed as one undivided plate.  The partial outline of a man's coat printed beyond the right borderline of  S. Giustina in Prà della Vale , repeated on the left of  Prà della Valle , seems to confirm the belief that the two etchings were intended to be joined after printing.\"  DeVesme 8 and 9; Bromberg 7 and 8."
