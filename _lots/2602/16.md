DESCRIPT: ALBRECHT DÜRER
CROSSHEAD: " The Nemesis ."
TYPESET: 'Engraving, circa 1501-02.  327x231 mm; 13x9¼ inches.  A superb, dark, richly-inked
  and early Meder II a impression, with the short vertical scratch under the center
  of the bridge, with burr in the heavily shaded parts of the mountains, notably at
  the right,  with the delicate horizontal scratch between the drapery and the upper
  left thigh, with several delicate scratches in the upper feathers, with particularly
  strong contrasts and no sign of wear, consistent with the earliest lifetime impressions
  in this state.  Partial bull''s head (?) watermark at the extreme lower edge of
  the sheet (Meder 62, which he dates from the mid to late 1400s).  Trimmed on the
  plate mark.  An extremely scarce impression in this quality, with the wings black
  and great clarity in the landscape, with every detail distinct.<br><br>The early
  1500s was a period of dramatic growth in Dürer''s (1471-1528) career and the fuller
  recognition of Italianate influence in his art.  His workshop expanded with his
  increasing popularity, enhanced significantly by the wide-scale distribution of
  his engravings and woodcuts throughout Europe, with the addition of three young
  artists: Hans Baldung Grien (1480-1545), Hans van Kulmbach (circa 1485-1522) and
  Hans Schäufelein (circa 1482-1539/40).  Dürer was preoccupied with a focus on the
  construction and proportion of the human figure at this time too, doubtlessly on
  account of his knowledge of Italian Renaissance art and recent travel to northern
  Italy, creating numerous drawings of standing female nudes and two of his most important
  engravings on the subject,  The Nemesis  and  Adam and Eve , 1504.<br><br>According
  to Bartrum, there is a preparatory ink drawing for  The Nemesis , now at the British
  Museum, London, which, "Is the earliest occasion that a proportionately constructed
  figure appears in one of his prints . . . The drawing also shows that Dürer originally
  planned a smaller, different type of wing, with the tips hanging down," (Bartrum,  Albrecht
  Dürer and his Legacy , London, 2002, page 73).  A separate study of wings on the
  same sheet shows how he ultimately intended to make them on the engraving, larger
  and much more intricately detailed.  Dürer''s handling of the figure of  The Nemesis  or
  Fortune was striking and revolutionary for its time, starkly silhouetted against
  the blank white background of the sheet of paper and floating ethereally along a
  drapery-like cloud lining above a minutely detailed landscape.<br><br>Bartrum notes
  that the subject, "Comes from the Latin poem  Manto  (Mantua) written by the Italian
  poet and philosopher Angelo Poliziano (1454-1494) and printed by Aldus Manutius
  in Venice in 1498.  Dürer probably became acquainted with it through Pirckheimer
  (the humanist and Nuremberg friend of the artist).  Nemesis, the classical god of
  retribution, whose goblet and bridle represent reward and castigation, is combined
  with the traditional winged figure of Fortune standing on a globe.  The landscape
  beneath has been identified as a view of Chiusa in the southern Tyrol (Alto Adige),
  of which Dürer had presumably made a drawing during his journey to Italy in 1494-95,
  although no record survives," (Bartrum, page 140).  Bartsch 77; Meder 72.'
