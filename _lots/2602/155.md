CROSSHEAD: " The Crucifixion of Polycrates ."
TYPESET: "Etching, circa 1662.  475x723 mm; 17x28Â½ inches, small margin.  Second state (of 2), with added drypoint.  A very good impression of this large, scarce etching with strong contrasts and little to no sign of wear.<br><br>Polycrates was the tyrant of the Greek island of Samos from the 540s BC to 522 BC.  He had a reputation as both a fierce warrior and an enlightened ruler.  Polycrates met his end during the Persian invasion of Greece in 1522.  He was double-crossed by the Persian leader Oroetes and assassinated.  The historian Herodotus is vague about the manner of Polycrates' death, saying only that it was an undignified end for a glorious ruler; he may have been impaled and his dead body was crucified.  Rosa (1615-1673) captures this undignified manner of death in his representation.<br><br>There is an oil painting by Rosa of the same subject, on which the etching is loosely-based, in the Art Institute of Chicago.  There is also a finished study for the etching, done in chalk, by Rosa in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.  Bartsch 10; Wallace 111."
