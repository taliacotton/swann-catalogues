TYPESET: "Etching on Japan paper, 1896.  282x435 mm; 11⅛x17⅛ inches, full margins.  Edition of approximately 100.  Signed in pencil, lower left.  With the lily pad  remarqué  in red ink, lower right.  A superb impression with all the delicate lines distinct.  <br><br>In 1883 the Rembrandt Club of Brooklyn sponsored a competition for best original etching of at least 10x15 inches.   Morning , which evokes Moran's (1837-1926) vision of deep sublimity through the struggle of natural forces, won first prize.   The plate became property of the Club and 100 perfect impressions were pulled from the plate, with each etching signed by Moran with his  remarqué .   The Rembrandt Club award was one among many awards and invitations to honorable arts organizations that Moran would earn in the decade of the 1880s, establishing his importance to contemporary etching and his growing interest in the print market (Anderson, pages 296-97).  Klackner 54."
