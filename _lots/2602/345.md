  of this extremely scarce print.<br><br>In 1932, Lewis (1881-1962) moved to Sandy
  Hook, Connecticut, temporarily leaving New York, to help reduce the cost of living
  during the Depression years.  Residing outside of the city inspired Lewis to explore
  country life in his work.  During this several year hiatus from New York, he created
  17 prints, many of which depict rural nocturnes as well as other local scenery,
  which enabled him to display his virtuoso mastery of tonal values.   Circus Night  depicts
  the arrival of Hunt's Three-Ring Circus to Sandy Hook.  McCarron 103.
