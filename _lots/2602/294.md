TYPESET: "Color lithograph printed in blue, 1896.  570x450 mm; 22½x17¾ inches, wide margins.  A very good impression of this extremely scarce lithograph.<br><br>The magazine  La Critique , founded in 1895, was a leading avant-garde publication that covered politics, theatre, music and the wider art scene in Paris.  In 1888, Valtat (1869-1952) studied at the Académie Julian with Pierre Bonnard (1867-1947) and Éduoard Vuillard (1868-1940), and both influenced Valtat's work.  In 1895 he worked with Toulouse-Lautrec and Albert André on the stage designs for  La Chariot de Terre Cuite .  Valtat ultimately settled in the south of France and became a prominent founding member, along with Henri Matisse, André Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck and others, of the Fauvist movement."
