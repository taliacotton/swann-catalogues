DESCRIPT: CRISTOFANO DI MICHELE MARTINI, IL ROBETTA
CROSSHEAD: " The Adoration of the Magi ."
TYPESET: <p>Engraving, circa 1496-1500. 303x280 mm; 12x11¼ inches, narrow margins.
  Cross on a mound watermark. A very good impression of this scarce, early engraving,
  with strong contrasts and little to no sign of wear.<br><br>This engraving is based
  on Filippino Lippi's (1457-1504) painting of the same subject, which dates from
  1496 and is now in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. Robetta (circa 1462-circa 1535)
  also adopted passages from other contemporaneous prints. The hat above his signature,
  for instance, is copied from Martin Schongauer's Adoration of the Magi , engraving,
  circa 1475 (Lehrs 6), as are the heads of the ox and ass to the viewer's right of
  the Virgin and Child. Meanwhile, the landscape derives from prints by Albrecht Dürer
  and the sky is based on his Virgin and Child with the Monkey (Bartsch 42, see <a

  for The Adoration of the Magi is now in the British Museum, London, and many extant
  impressions were printed during the 19th century; earlier printings such as the
  current work are extremely scarce. Bartsch 6; Hind 10.</p>
