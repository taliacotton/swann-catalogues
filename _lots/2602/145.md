TYPESET: "Etching, circa 1657.  156x208 mm; 6¼x8¼ inches, small margins.  Biörklund's tenth state (of 10), with the horizontal parallel shading lines on the tree tops through the window, however with the slipped stroke on the left cheek from the eighth state still distinct; Usticke's seventh state (of 9); White and Boon's tenth state (of 10); New Hollstein's eleventh state (of 12).  A very good, dark and well-inked impression, with the landscape through the window still distinct.<br><br>Francen (1612-after 1678) was a close friend of Rembrandt and a lifelong resident of Amsterdam (though records of the various addresses in the city where he lived indicate that he was not a particularly well-to-do collector).  He was a passionate connoisseur of art, which Rembrandt alludes to with the Crucifixion triptych and the landscape painting on the wall of Francen's study, as well as the Taoist sculpture on the table, and in this collecting eclecticism he and Rembrandt surely had a kinship.<br><br>Francen testified for Rembrandt and helped support him through his financial difficulties in the 1650s and 1660s; he also acted as a sort of guardian for Rembrandt's only child (of four) to survive into adulthood, Titus (1641-1668).  Rembrandt likely made this etched portrait of Francen out of friendship rather than as a paid commission.   Bartsch 273; Biörklund 57-2; Hollstein (White and Boon) 273; New Hollstein 301."
