A very good, early impression of this extremely scarce etching.<br><br>According to DeGrazia, in  The Holy Family with Saint John the Baptist , Annibale purposely left his contour lines broken and discontinuous to merge his figures with the surrounding atmosphere.  This is especially evident in the left arm of the Virgin, which is almost part of the foliage in the background.  These broken contour lines also add to the effect of movement of the forms, giving a kind of shimmering quality to the whole.\"  Bartsch 11; DeGrazia 11."
