Daitz, New York<br><br>Made hours after a battle at Fredericksburgh, Virginia, this dramatic and haunting photograph depicts a ruined Confederate two-wheeled vehicle for artillery ammunition and its team of horses. Russell posed his companions General Herman Haupt on the left and General William Wierman Wright, a civil engineer, on the right, just past the caisson on the road. At the time, this photograph would have been as close to a journalistic battle scene image as was technically possible."
