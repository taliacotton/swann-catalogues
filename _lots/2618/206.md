CROSSHEAD: "A pamphlet from the iconic New Documents exhibition."
TYPESET: "A pristine tri-folded pamphlet printed with red text and reproductions of work from each of the three photographers featured in the show, all then relatively unknown. First shown at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, this pamphlet corresponds to the touring show, and which included a total of 60 works. With an introduction from curator John Szarkowski, a short biographical note on each photographer, and a full exhibition checklist. 1967<br><br>In his introduction Szarkowski writes: \"Most of those who were called documentary photographers a generation ago, when the label was new, made their pictures in the service of a social cause. It was their aim to show what was wrong with the world, and to persuade their fellows to take action and make it right.<br>In the past decade a new generation of photographers has directed the documentary approach toward more personal ends. Their aim has been not to reform life, but to know it. Their work betrays a sympathy--almost an affection--for the imperfections and the frailties of society. They like the real world, in spite of its terrors, as the source of all wonder and fascination and value, and find it no less precious for being irrational.\""
