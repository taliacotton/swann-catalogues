Bender had been a patron of Ansel Adams since they met in 1926, when Bender was 60 and Adams only 24. Not only was Bender a patron of Adams, but they also became close friends as documented though numerous letters in the Ansel Adams papers at the Center for Creative Photography and in the Bender papers at Mills College."
