TYPESET: "Albumen print, the image measuring 14¾x17⅞ inches (35.6x43.2 cm.), the mount 19¾x23 inches (48.3x58.4 cm.), with the photographers' Buchholz & Hendrick printed gilt-lettered credit and title on mount recto; in a period frame. Circa 1870s-80s<br><br>The Oread Institute was built by Eli Thayer of Worcester on a piece of land known as “Goat Hill” off Main Street in 1849. The Oread offered three levels of instruction: primary, academic, and collegiate. The four-year collegiate program offered a classical, college-level curriculum and is thought to be the first institution of its kind exclusively for women in the country. It was modeled after the program at Brown University, Thayer’s alma mater. The Oread taught women students for 32 years, from 1849–1881. Laura C. Spelman, later the wife of John D. Rockefeller, and her sister Lucy M. attended Oread in 1858. It later became The Worcester Domestic Science Cooking School (1898–1904) where, it is reputed, shredded wheat was invented. The Oread was razed in 1934."
