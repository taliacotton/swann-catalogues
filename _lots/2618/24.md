DESCRIPT: "PIERRE CHOUMOFF (1872-1936)"
CROSSHEAD: "An archive of more than 50 photographs of Auguste Rodin's (1840-1917) sculptural works, as well as two portraits of the influential artist."
TYPESET: "The archive includes a period album with about 30 photographs as well as a binder containing about 20 loose prints. The archive includes numerous beautifully lit and carefully composed images of Rodin's sculptures, including fine detail and dimensional renderings of the important work. Silver prints, the images measuring 9x6Â¾ inches (22.9x17.1 cm.), and smaller, the sheets slightly larger, nearly all with a title of the work in ink and/or Choumoff's stamp (some faint) on verso. Small folio, tan cloth; post binding; here the prints are mounted recto only and many are loose. Circa 1915-17<br><br>Pierre Choumoff was the last photographer Auguste Rodin worked with to document his sculptures. Rodin believed strongly in the ability of photography to disseminate his work, and the pair collaborated on 300 images. Choumoff was able to use artificial lighting to control the surfaces of the sculptures, resulting in photographs that beautifully translate the surface texture, detail, and emotive dimensions Rodin achieved. Choumoff also photographed Rodin on his deathbed."
