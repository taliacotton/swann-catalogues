Profusely illustrated with Meyer's bold journalistic photographs, commissioned by the national petroleum company Pemex to coincide with its fiftieth anniversary. However, Meyer's socially conscious work and dedication of the volume to Lazaro Cardenas, the politically left former president who established Pemex and nationalized the oil industry, led the current government to seize existing copies and stop distribution of the volume. Small folio, gilt-lettered black cloth; photo-pictorial dust jacket, only lightly worn at the corners. Parr/Badger II 198. FIRST EDITION."
