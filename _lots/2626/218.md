Circa 1930. <br><br>Theophilus Ballou White was a Philadelphia-based architect and artist born in Norfolk, Virginia.  During the Great Depression, he worked as an artist for the Public Works of Art Project and his lithographs were shown in the Division of Graphic Work's December-January 1933-34 exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. These lithographs were based on sketches White made during the summer of 1932 in remote West Virginia.  Later that summer, White worked on documenting the history of the Church of England and the parishes along the James River.  In addition to his research, he completed the series of lithographs, <i>Seven Old Churches in Virginia</i>.  Many of the artist's early prints feature architecture.  In the winter of 1932, White created seven portfolios entitled <i>Colonial Mansion in Fairmount Park</i>.  Later, White took on a more modernist style."
