TYPESET: "<br>Lithograph.  253x203 mm; 10x8 inches, wide margins.  Edition of 250.  Signed in pencil, lower right.  Published by Associated American Artists, New York.   1938.<br><br>A very good impression.<br><br>Jones was born in St. Louis, Missouri.  Self-taught, he quit school at age fifteen to work as a house painter, his father's profession.  In 1933, ten patrons led by Elizabeth Green in St. Louis formed a \"Joe Jones Club\" and financed his travel to the artists' colony in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where he furthered his artistic training.  In August 1935, Jones painted a mural series at the Commonwealth College at Mena, Arkansas.  He painted a New Deal mural for the post office in Charleston, Missouri, titled <i>Harvest</i> in 1938.  This mural was done at the height of Jones' fame and is a classic subject for the artist.  It depicts the harvest of wheat in a very labor-intensive manner showing the cutting, gathering, and stacking of it onto a wagon.  Under a cloudy dark sky, wheat dominates the perspective with the farmers providing a great deal of motion.  Another New Deal mural entitled <i>Men and Wheat</i> was painted by Jones in 1940, followed by <i>Husking Corn</i> in 1941 for the Dexter, Missouri, post office,  <i>Turning a Corner</i> in 1939 in Anthony, Kansas and <i>Threshing in Magnolia</i>, Arkansas, in 1938.  All the murals depicted some process during a wheat harvest."
