It is one of my favorite lithographs.\"<br><br>Soyer was born in Russia and immigrated to New York at the age of twelve. He studied at Cooper Union, the National Academy of Design and with Guy Pène du Bois (1884-1958) at the Art Students League.  He is known as a Social Realist, depicting the daily struggles of those living in New York City.
