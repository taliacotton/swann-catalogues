TYPESET: "<br>Oil on masonite. Signed, <i>S.B. Beach,</i> lower right. 610x508 mm; 24x20 inches. <br><br>Sarah Berman was a mostly self-taught artist of Ukrainian/Jewish heritage, who emigrated to the United States as a child with her family. While Sarah Berman worked in sweatshops to make ends meet, she taught herself to paint. One opportunity was afforded to her under portraitist Robert Henri to attend classes at the Anarchist Centre in Harlem, with access to a graphics workshop run by the WPA (Works Progress Administration). In 1940 Bermanâ€™s work appeared at the Museum of Modern Art in <i>American Color Prints Under $10.</i> The show was orchestrated to bring affordable art to the general population. Her works are in the permanent collections of The Smithsonian Museum of American Art, washington, DC, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY."
