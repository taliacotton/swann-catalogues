Burne-Jones 103.<br><br>Kent was a WPA muralist whose commission for the Post Office in Washington, DC (now the Clinton Federal Building) was highly controversial.  The mural portrayed Puerto Rico's first airmail delivery and seemed to sympathize with the cause for Puerto Rican independence.  A woman is shown with a letter in Kuskokwim Eskimo dialect that reads \"To the people of Puerto Rico, our friends! Let us change chiefs. That alone can make us equal and free!\""
