Signed, titled, dated and inscribed \"ap\" in pencil, lower margin.  1931.<br><br>A superb, richly-inked impression of this very scarce etching.<br><br>Friedlander was born in Latvia.  In 1912, he went to Italy where he met and worked with the Russian artist Maxim Gorky.  During this period he also received his only art training, studying etching, drawing and relief printing at the Academy of Rome.  In 1937, he emigrated to New York where he worked full time as an artist until his death.  He is best known for his woodcuts and etchings, many of which are embued with a sharp social commentary reflecting the despair of the WPA era.  His work is in many major American museums, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC, and the Brooklyn Museum, New York."
