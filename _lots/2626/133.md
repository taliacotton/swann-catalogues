CROSSHEAD: "<i>Farewell</i>."
TYPESET: "<br>Lithograph.  412x321 mm; 16x12½ inches, wide margins.  Signed and titled in pencil, lower margin.  1943. <br><br>A very good impression of this extremely scarce lithograph.  Cole 61.<br><br>Cole notes an edition of approximately 100, but we have found only one other impression at auction in the past 30 years, indicating a significantly smaller edition.  <br><br>Soyer was born in Russia and immigrated to New York at the age of twelve.  He studied at Cooper Union, the National Academy of Design and with Guy Pène du Bois (1884-1958) at the Art Students League.  He is known as a Social Realist, depicting the daily struggles of those living in New York City.  His chosen subject matter became especially poignant at the onset of the Great Depression, and, after he began to exhibit his work in the late 1920s, he cemented his reputation among the top American realist artists of the 20th century."
