An Olympic hopeful, his dreams were thwarted when in his sophomore year, he contracted a life-threatening streptococcus infection that left him permanently disabled.  It is during this time that Landacre first took a drawing class.  In 1918 Landacre got a job as an illustrator and returned to school in 1923 at the Otis Art Institute, where he would encounter wood engraving for the first time.  During the Great Depression Landacre worked for the graphics department of the California WPA."
