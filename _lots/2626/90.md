The group shows, print workshops, and large scale easel projects allowed artists to work together, socialize, and exchange ideas. The Ten was a group of progressive thinking artists that banded together to find strength in numbers so that they could express themselves freely through their art work and exhibit their works on their own terms. Ben-Zion, Ilya Bolotowsky, Adolph Gottlieb, Louis harris, Yankel Kufeld, Mark Rothko, Louis Schanker, Joseph Solman, and Nahum Tschacbasov were the original members of this important American artist's collective. After Kufeld and Tschacbasov dropped out of the group Earl Kerkam and Ralph Rosenborg  joined."
