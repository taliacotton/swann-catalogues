After moving to Maine, Kent took up wood engraving and gained a reputation as a prolific graphic artist in the 1920s.  An intrepid traveller, Kent went on a number of trips to the most remote parts of the world, which heavily inspired his artwork.  In 1937 he was commissioned by the Federal Public Works Administration to create two murals for the New Post Office in Washington DC, today the William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building."
