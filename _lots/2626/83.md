Circa 1930.<br><br>A Jewish-American painter originally from the Polish city of Bialystok, then part of the Russian Empire (he emigrated to the United States in 1891), Weber is considered among the foremost American modernist artists, helping to introduce Cubism to America in the early 1900s.  While loosely associated with the WPA, Weber taught for decades, beginning in the 1920s, at the Art Students League, New York, and contributed a design to the 1939 pamphlet <i>12 Cartoons Defending the WPA by Members of the American Artists Congress</i>."
