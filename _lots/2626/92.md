She first visited New Mexico in 1925 and returned numerous times throughout the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.  Kloss received widespread recognition and awards during the 1930s.  From 1933 to 1944 she was the sole etcher employed by the Public Works of Art Project.  Her series of nine New Mexico scenes from that period were reproduced and distributed to public schools across the state.  She also created watercolors and oil paintings for the WPA.  In 1935, she was one of three Taos artists who represented New Mexico at a Paris exhibition called \"Three Centuries of Art in the United States.\""
