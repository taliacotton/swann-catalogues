He returned to Pittsburgh in the 1930's and joined the WPA Art Project, painting easel work and one large school mural.  He later traveled to Mexico where he met Diego Rivera and worked under David Siqueiros. Returning to Pittsburgh, Crist was encouraged by Buck's County Modernist, Lloyd Ney, to paint non-objectively. His works were in museum exhibitions at such venues as the Cincinnati Art Museum, The Whitney Museum of American Art, The Guggenheim Museum. Much of Cristâ€™s work is owned by Pennsylvania State University, University of Pennsylvania, and Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. The last decades of Crist's life were spent as part of the Woodstock art colony from 1960 until his death in 1985."
