DESCRIPT: "MARTIN LEWIS (1881-1962)"
CROSSHEAD: "<i>Late Traveler.</i>"
TYPESET: "<br>Drypoint.  247x300 mm; 9⅞x11⅞ inches, full margins.    Signed \"Martin Lewis P.L.\" by the artist's daughter-in-law, Patricia Lewis, lower right.  Printed by Edna Myers, Montreal.  1949, printed circa 1982. <br><br>A very good, richly-inked impression of this scarce print with dark contrasts. <br><br>According to McCarron, \"<i>Late Traveler</i> is remarkable for the black tones that make up the kiosks, in particular their fish-scale patterned roofs, which are difficult to see except in the strongest light.  All subway kiosks, like those depicted by Lewis, were torn down by the City of New York.  A reconstructed example, built by the city at great expense, stands at Astor Place and Fourth Avenue, the entrace to the Astor Place station of the Lexington Avenue line.\"  McCarron 143."
