Signed, <i>Joseph Wolins,</i> dated, <i>1938,</i> and inscribed as titled on stretcher. 610x1016 mm; 24x40 inches. <br><br>Joseph Wolins began studying art in 1935 at age 20. During his time at New York City’s National Academy of Design, he studied under Leon Kroll. In 1937 he traveled to Europe, there discovering the works of Italian Renaissance painters Piero Della Francesca and Giotto. While in Europe Wolins also had the opportunity to see the Contemporary Paris Exhibition <i>Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne</I>. Among the modern works exhibited were Picasso’s <i>Guernica</i>, and Alexander Calder’s <i>Mercury Fountain</i> whose influence Wolins would carry with him throughout his career. <br><br>After returning home Joseph joined The Federal Art Project, a branch of the WPA (Works Progress Administration) which employed as many as 10,000 artists at any given time. Typically known for the jarring images of life’s difficulty during The Great Depression (1929-1939) Wolins work revealed a more cubist/impressionistic approach very much motivated by his time in Europe. <br><br>In 1947 Wolins would have his first solo exhibition. He would go on to be featured at the 1964/65 New York World’s fair, The Whitney Museum, The Smithsonian and many others. Joseph Wolins, died in 1999, in New York City."
