Signed, titled and inscribed \"(artist's proof)\" in pencil, lower margin.  1935.<br><br>A superb impression with strong contrasts.  Davenport 38.<br><br>Cadmus' works for the Works Progress Administration have frequently been envoked in the debate of censorship.  Cadmus' tempera on canvas <i>Fleets In!</i>, 1934 for the Public Works of Art Project depicted carousing U.S. sailors on shore leave.  <i>Aspects of Suburban Life</i>, 1936 was a series of studies for a Port Washington, Long Island post office mural commissioned by the Treasury Relief Art Project.  The project was never realized as it showed affluent Long Islanders in a negative light and insinuated an obvious and growing class divide.  Both Cadmus and Jared French (1905-1988) each received mural commissions for the lobby of the Parcel Post Building in Richmond, Virginia, completed in 1939.  Cadmus' mural <i>Pocahontas Saving the Life of John Smith</i> was retouched by the artist when it was noticed that one of the Powhatan men's breechcloth fox heads resembled a phallus.  The debate over public censorship continues when discussing Cadmus' legacy.  In a 1992 New York Times article, the artist's works were still criticized, \"For its money, the W.P.A. got several subversive works from Cadmus . . .\""
