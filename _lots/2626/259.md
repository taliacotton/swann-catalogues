DESCRIPT: "ARTHUR C. RADEBAUGH (1906-1974)"
CROSSHEAD: "<i>New York World's Fair / United Air Lines.</i>"
TYPESET: "<br>Poster calendar, with 12 calendar sheets attached at bottom. 692x394 mm, 27¼x15½ inches. <br><br>A United Airlines Douglas DC-3 \"Mainliner\" makes its way across a truncated map of the United States. The plane is flying from the Golden Gate Bridge and the towers of Treasure Island at the San Francisco World's Fair to the New York World's Fair Trylon and Perisphere on the opposite side of the country. Radebaugh's love of the airbrush began with his studies at the Art Institute of Chicago. Although virtually unknown in the poster community, he became a prolific illustrator for magazines including <i>Esquire, Fortune,</i> and <i>Motor</i> and produced advertisements for Coca-Cola and United Airlines as well as the auto industry. His trademark style was the ultimate in \"luminous Art Deco . . . a sense of industrial design that was both pragmatic and prescient; he took what was cutting edge . . . and made them more elegant, functional and fantastical to behold\" (http://arthur-radebaugh.blogspot.com/). This image also appeared as a regular poster (See Swann Sale 2589 Lot 232).  <br><br>Airline p. 26 (var), Airways p. 45 (var)."
