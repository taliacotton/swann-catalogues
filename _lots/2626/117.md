He learned various forms of printmaking during his studies and apprenticed for a printer. He worked as an illustrator in Germany, but in 1933, as Nazi Germany rose to power, he immigrated to the United States. He participated in the Federal Arts Project during the 1930s, and had a successful career as a book illustrator and teacher at the New School for Social Research, Pratt Institute and the University of Rhode Island.
