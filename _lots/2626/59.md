Williams 13.<br><br>According to Williams, this print was made for the opening of the Terry Dintenfass Gallery, New York when Dintenfass asked each of the gallery artists to make a lithograph self-portrait.  This is the only self-portrait Gwathmey ever made. <br><br>Gwathmey is one of the most celebrated painter-printmakers of African-American life in the southern United States. As an outsider to the African-American rural communities, his works are that of an observer, picturesque scenes of everyday life. He managed unbiasedly to imbue humanity and an unromanticized dignity into his subjects. <br><br>In 1941 Gwathmey was commissioned by the Treasury Section of Fine Arts to comeplete a mural, <i>The Countryside</i> for the post office in Eutaw, Alabama."
