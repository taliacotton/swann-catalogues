Avery struggled financially in during the early years of the Great Depression and though he showed at several galleries, including at Temporary Galleries, New York's municipal art gallery, funded by the city, he only found a small income with few art sales.  In 1938, Avery started a brief period as an artist in the Easel Division of the WPA Federal Art Project."
