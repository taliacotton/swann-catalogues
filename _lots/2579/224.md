Both 1969. <br><br>Goldfarb was among the many artists whom enjoyed both a professional and personal relationship with Virginia Zabriskie, who represented her in Paris and New York.  Goldfarb was a contemporary of the New York School, attending the Art Students League in 1949 where she met Jackson Pollock (1912-1956).  Goldfarb did not stay in New York for long after her studies, though continued to paint in the Abstract Expressionist style into the 1960s.  In 1954, she moved to Paris, where she forged her career as a female abstract artist with an unshakable identity.  Goldfarb embraced the Parisian art scene and was welcomed into the same circles as Man Ray (1890-1976) and other American ex-pats.  Distance from New York perhaps led her to develop her unique style which blended French pointillism, sophisticated color theory, and her roots in abstraction.  She was renown in her mature career for her monumental works of loose gridded dabs of bright, radiating colors."
