  in crayon, verso. Both 1969. <br><br>Goldfarb was represented by Virginia Zabriskie
  in Paris and New York.  Goldfarb was a contemporary of the New York School, attending
  the Art Students League in 1949 where she met Jackson Pollock (1912-1956).  Goldfarb
  did not stay in New York for long after her studies. She continued to paint in the
  Abstract Expressionist style into the 1960s.  In 1954, she moved to Paris, where
  she forged her career as an abstract artist with an unshakable identity.  Goldfarb
  embraced the Parisian art scene and was welcomed into the same circles as Man Ray
  (1890-1976) and other American ex-pats.  Distance from New York perhaps led her
  to develop her unique style which blended French pointillism, sophisticated color
  theory, and her roots in abstraction..</p>"
