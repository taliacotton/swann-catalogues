CROSSHEAD: Untitled.
TYPESET: "<p><br>Oil on canvas. 180x140 mm; 7x5Â½ inches. Signed and dated in ballpoint
  pen and ink on the stretcher bar, verso. 1962.<br><br>Goldfarb was represented by
  Virginia Zabriskie in Paris and New York.  Goldfarb was a contemporary of the New
  York School, attending the Art Students League in 1949 where she met Jackson Pollock
  (1912-1956).  Goldfarb did not stay in New York for long after her studies. She
  continued to paint in the Abstract Expressionist style into the 1960s.  In 1954,
  she moved to Paris, where she forged her career as an abstract artist with an unshakable
  identity.  Goldfarb embraced the Parisian art scene and was welcomed into the same
  circles as Man Ray (1890-1976) and other American ex-pats.  Distance from New York
  perhaps led her to develop her unique style which blended French pointillism, sophisticated
  color theory, and her roots in abstraction.</p>"
