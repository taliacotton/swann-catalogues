DESCRIPT: PAT ADAMS (1928 - )
CROSSHEAD: Untitled.
TYPESET: "<p><br>Acrylic, watercolor, pen and ink, sand, shell and grit on cream wove
  paper. 375x530 mm; 14¾x20⅞ inches.</p><p>Provenance: Acquired from the artist.</p><p>Adams'
  work was the subject of Zabriskie Gallery's 50th Anniversary exhibition in 2004.
  She was part of the Korman Gallery roster before Zabriskie purchased the gallery
  and flourished with it for fifty years, fostering a deep personal and professional
  relationship with Virginia Zabriskie. To Adams, Zabriskie was a steady presence
  throughout the artist's career, and the last discerning eye whose approving gaze
  would complete her creative process and herald her works into the larger, art-consuming
  world. Adams' abstract paintings analyze the relationship between macro- and micro-cosms,
  and by not depending on spectacle or sensationalism, are accessible by the viewer.
  Through her long and industrious career, spanning many art movements, Adams' work
  has  adhered to her mission of experimentation and of crafting forms which are tangible
  either in our reality or in a mystical cosmos.</p>"
