Both 582x740 mm; 23x29 inches.  Both circa 1970.<br><br>Westerlund Roosen was born in New York and is known primarily as a sculptor.  Although working in a minimalist aesthetic, she rejects traditional Minimalism with its strict geometry, hard edges and industrial sensibilities.  Instead, she values the handmade and gives her pieces sensuality and movement, imbuing them with life through embracing the accidental and imperfect.  Repetition is another important aspect of her style, with shapes naturally replicating themselves throughout her compositions.  Her work is included in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Musuem and the Storm King Art Center."
