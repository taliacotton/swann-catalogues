TYPESET: "<br>Oil on canvas.  445x705 mm; 17½x27¾ inches.  Signed and dated in oil, lower right recto.  1961.<br><br>Published: <i>Zabriskie Fifty Years</i>, 2004, page 98 (illustrated).<br><br>Hartl, born in Paris and trained as a master dyer, was admired by fellow artists for his untrained innate talent and sense of color.  The artist Fairfield Porter (1907-1975) wrote admiringly of his career and technique in Art News</i> in 1953, noting that Hartl drew directly with paint and never added medium to his pigments, only using turpentine for erasing.  He told Porter, \"Art is a feeling of things, not a description of them.  When you are young you are sensual, later your exaltation is more spiritual.\"<br><br>When Hartl came to the United States in 1912, he turned to painting to assuage his homesickness.  At first, he painted French flowers and birds from memory but even his mature work was autobiographical of either his life in France or New York.  Hartl used real-life references to inform his color choices (an apple and fallen leaves for a landscape scene) and usually worked on multiple paintings at once.  Though his career spanned the Abstract movement in the United States, Hartl remained steadfast with representative art. In 1920, he exhibited in group shows at the New Gallery alongside Ernest Fiene (1894-1965), Arnold Friedman (1879-1946), Joseph Stella (1877-1946) and Carl Sprinchorn (1877-1971).  He was represented by Juliana Force of the Whitney Studio Galleries (formerly Whitney Studio Club) from its formation in 1928 through its metamorphosis into the Whitney Museum in 1931.  Hartl had numerous solo exhibitions in New York, with one at Zabriskie Gallery in 1967."
