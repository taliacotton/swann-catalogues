  1935-53. <br><br>Schwarz 441.</p><p>Duchamp's <em>Rotoreliefs</em> were meant to
  spin on a turntable to achieve the ideal optical illusion. When viewed with one
  eye, each of the 12 rotating disks creates for the viewer a startling vision of
  depth and pulsating movement. <em>Rotoreliefs</em> can be considered as an extension
  of the same experimentation that had motivated the creation of Duchamp's Rotary
  <em>Demisphere</em>, an elaborate motorized construction made in 1925. Duchamp first
  published <em>Rotoreliefs</em>, in an edition of 500, in 1935, and initially displayed
  and offered them for sale at the Concours Lépine inventor’s fair in Paris.  He sold
  only several sets.  Duchamp and Man Ray had filmed early versions of the spinning
  discs for the short film <em>Anémic Cinéma, 1926</em>.  One of the discs entitled
  <em>Corolles</em> was printed in red and black and adorned the cover of the French
  surrealist magazine <em>Minotaure</em>, no. 6, 1935.</p>"
