  00190-O-2021.<br><br><em>Pain peint</em>, a painted blue baguette, was conceived
  by Man Ray in 1958; this exhibition catalogue with a miniature replica of <em>Pain
  peint</em> on the front cover was published in 1973 as the commemorative exhibition
  catalogue for the one-man show Man Ray held at the Galerie Alexandre Iolas, Paris,
  1973-74.<br><br> Man Ray described the readymade <em>Pain peint</em> in 1972 as
  follows, "You see, when I painted a local bread blue, the idea of a title came to
  me almost immediately and almost automatically: in French ''pain peint'', painted
  bread, because it sounds also like the kids running down the street after a fire
  engine and imitating the sound of the sirens: ''pain–pain–pain–pain–pain–pain'',
  you know."<br><br>Martin 127.</p>'
