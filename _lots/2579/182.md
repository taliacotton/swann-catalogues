TYPESET: "<br>Oil on canvas.  860x1065 mm; 33¾x42 inches.  Signed in oil, lower right recto, and titled in ink, verso.  1959.<br><br>Fromboluti was born in Hershey, Pennsylvania of Italian immigrants during the Great Depression.  He was the first of his family to attend college having won the only scholarship offered by his high school to the Tyler College of Art, Philadelphia.  He subsequently earned a BFA and Masters degree.  He was drafted into the Army during World War II, completing his service in Junction City, Kansas.  Following the war, Fromboluti moved with his wife, the artist Nora Speyer, whom he met and married while at the Tyler College of Art, and they built a summer home and studio on Higgins Pond in Wellfleet in 1966 after previous summers in Woodstock and Martha’s Vineyard.  Both artists painted in lush, impastoed surfaces, and Fromboluti's abstract style was in synch with the New York School of Abstract Expressionism."
