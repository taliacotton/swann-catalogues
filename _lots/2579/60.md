  mm; 13x10 inches.  Signed in pencil, upper left recto.<br><br>Schmidt began her
  training at the Art Students League in New York, where she met her husband Yasuo
  Kuniyoshi (1889-1953).  Throughout the 1920s, she received critical praise for her
  still lifes, landscapes and portrayals of New York urban life, exhibiting frequently
  at prominent, modern New York galleries such as the Downtown Gallery, the Daniel
  Gallery and the Whitney Studio Club (of which she was a founding member and where
  she had her first solo exhibition in 1923).  She became dissatisfied with her work
  from around 1939 until 1960, producing less though still participating in group
  exhibitions, when a crumpled paper towel on a table inspired her to explore the
  motif of dead leaves and discarded paper, the style of which approached "magical
  realism."  She is known for her impeccable technique and her elevation of everyday,
  overlooked subjects.
