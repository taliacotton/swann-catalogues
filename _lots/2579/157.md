After his studies, he won a Guggenheim Fellowship and traveled extensively throughout Europe, meeting artists such as Wassily Kandinsky and Fernand Léger, which cemented his interest in pursuing abstraction as an art form. Returning to New York, he worked as a commercial photographer professionally to survive, while continuing to create his own asbstract art before dedicating himself exclusively to his career as an artist in 1948.  Having started his career as a painter, he switched to creating sculptures in the 1950s.  He gained his reputation mostly for his sculptural work, which was extremely innovative for its time, and incorporated found objects such as machine parts and natural elements like stones."
