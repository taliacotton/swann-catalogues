  began her training at the Art Students League in New York, where she met her husband
  Yasuo Kuniyoshi (1889-1953).  Throughout the 1920s, she received critical praise
  for her still lifes, landscapes and portrayals of New York urban life, exhibiting
  frequently at prominent, modern New York galleries such as the Downtown Gallery,
  the Daniel Gallery and the Whitney Studio Club (of which she was a founding member
  and where she had her first solo exhibition in 1923).  She became dissatisfied with
  her work from around 1939 until 1960, producing less though still participating
  in group exhibitions, when a crumpled paper towel on a table inspired her to explore
  the motif of dead leaves and discarded paper, the style of which approached "magical
  realism."  She is known for her impeccable technique and her elevation of everyday,
  overlooked subjects.
