CROSSHEAD: "Sketchbook with approximately 40 drawings."
TYPESET: "<br>Spiral-bound sketchbook with approximately 40 pencil, crayon or pen and ink drawings.  270x210 mm; 10½x8¼ inches.  Signed, dated \"1960\" and inscribed in ink on the front cover.  With a pen and ink and crayon portrait of the artist David Burliuk on the front cover and a color crayon portrait of the artist Paul Manship on the rear cover. Circa 1930s-40s.<br><br>The drawings in this sketchbook appear to date from the 1930s, when Graham was making work in the abstract, post-Cubist style of Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), to the 1940s, when his abstract style (there are several pencil drawings in the sketchbook of loosely rendered landscapes over which the artist has scrawled abstract color crayon lines) became a strong influence on Abstract Expressionist artists who he counted among his friends and acquaintances, such as Willem de Kooning (1904-1997), Jackson Pollock (1912-1956), Lee Krasner (1908-1984), Mark Rothko (1903-1970) and David Smith (1906-1965), in addition to stylized portraits of artists and other figures he sketched in New York and Paris during the 1930s-40s, including the portraits of David Burliuk (1882-1967) and Paul Manship (1885-1966) on the covers."
