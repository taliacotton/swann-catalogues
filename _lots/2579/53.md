DESCRIPT: JOHN GRAHAM (1886-1961)
CROSSHEAD: Sketchbook with approximately 40 drawings.
TYPESET: <br>Spiral-bound sketchbook with approximately 40 pencil, crayon or pen and
  ink drawings.  270x210 mm; 10½x8¼ inches.  Signed, dated "1960" and inscribed in
  ink on the front cover.  With a pen and ink and crayon portrait of the artist David
  Burliuk on the front cover and a color crayon portrait of the artist Paul Manship
  on the rear cover. Circa 1930s-40s.<br><br>The drawings in this sketchbook appear
  to date from the 1930s, when Graham was making work in the abstract, post-Cubist
  style of Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), to the 1940s, when his abstract style (there
  are several pencil drawings in the sketchbook of loosely rendered landscapes over
  which the artist has scrawled abstract color crayon lines) became a strong influence
  on Abstract Expressionist artists who he counted among his friends and acquaintances,
  such as Willem de Kooning (1904-1997), Jackson Pollock (1912-1956), Lee Krasner
  (1908-1984), Mark Rothko (1903-1970) and David Smith (1906-1965), in addition to
  stylized portraits of artists and other figures he sketched in New York and Paris
  during the 1930s-40s, including the portraits of David Burliuk (1882-1967) and Paul
  Manship (1885-1966) on the covers.
