  League in New York, where she met her husband Yasuo Kuniyoshi (1889-1953).  Throughout
  the 1920s, she received critical praise for her still lifes, landscapes and portrayals
  of New York urban life, exhibiting frequently at prominent, modern New York galleries
  such as the Downtown Gallery, the Daniel Gallery and the Whitney Studio Club (of
  which she was a founding member and where she had her first solo exhibition in 1923).  She
  became dissatisfied with her work from around 1939 until 1960, producing less though
  still participating in group exhibitions, when a crumpled paper towel on a table
  inspired her to explore the motif of dead leaves and discarded paper, the style
  of which approached "magical realism."  She is known for her impeccable technique
  and her elevation of everyday, overlooked subjects.
