TYPESET: '<p><br>Oil on canvas. 405x515 mm; 16x20¼ inches. Signed and dated in oil,
  upper right recto. Signed, dated and annotated "Noir brisé sur Blanc" in oil, verso
  (obscured by restoration). 1921.<br><br>Published: Zabriskie Gallery, <em>Zabriskie
  Fifty Years</em>, 2004, page 82 (illustrated).<br><br>Hartl, born in Paris and trained
  as a master dyer, was admired by fellow artists for his untrained innate talent
  and sense of color. The artist Fairfield Porter (1907-1975) wrote admiringly of
  his career and technique in <em>Art News</em> in 1953, noting that Hartl drew directly
  with paint and never added medium to his pigments, only using turpentine for erasing.
  He told Porter, "Art is a feeling of things, not a description of them. When you
  are young you are sensual, later your exaltation is more spiritual."<br><br>When
  Hartl came to the United States in 1912, he turned to painting to assuage his homesickness.
  At first, he painted French flowers and birds from memory.  Even his mature work
  was autobiographical of either his life in France or New York. Hartl used real-life
  references to inform his color choices (an apple and fallen leaves for a landscape
  scene) and usually worked on multiple paintings at once. Though his career spanned
  the Abstract movement in the United States, Hartl remained steadfast with representative
  art. In 1920, he exhibited in group shows at the New Gallery alongside Ernest Fiene
  (1894-1965), Arnold Friedman (1879-1946), Joseph Stella (1877-1946) and Carl Sprinchorn
  (1877-1971). He was represented by Juliana Force of the Whitney Studio Galleries
  (formerly Whitney Studio Club) from its formation in 1928 through its metamorphosis
  into the Whitney Museum in 1931. Hartl had numerous solo exhibitions in New York,
  with one at Zabriskie Gallery in 1967.</p>'
