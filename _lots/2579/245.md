He has walked in more than 25 countries in the past 30 years, including trips to the tops of Mount Everest and Denali. “If I do not walk, I cannot make a work of art,” Fulton explains. “The physical involvement of walking creates a receptiveness to the landscape.  I walk on the land to be woven into nature.  A road walk can transform the everyday world and give a heightened sense of human history.” Fulton translates his walks into other media, including photographs, wall texts, and drawings, allowing the viewer to participate in his primary medium."
