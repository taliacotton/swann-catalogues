  Committee reference: 00185-O-2021.</p><p><br>Provenance: Acquired from Julien Levy,
  New York. <br><br>The original 1922-23 object, titled <em>Object to be Destroyed
  (Objet à détruire)</em> consisted of a photograph of an eye attached with a paperclip
  to a metronome. Man Ray created the object spontaneously as he was painting in rhythm
  with a metronome in his studio. The act of destruction was an additional conceptual
  component to the art object, the dismantling also viewed as a creative act (most
  of Man Ray's original objects only exist in photographs). In 1932, after it had
  already been destroyed by Man Ray in his studio, he remade <em>Object to be Destroyed</em>
  to exhibit, this time with a photograph of the eye of his former lover, Lee Miller.
  Another replica was created after the 1932 version was lost when Man Ray fled Paris
  for New York in 1940. This replica was created for Julien Levy Gallery, New York
  in 1945, and called <em>Lost Object</em> (also called <em>Last Object</em>). It
  was one of 10 “Objects of my Affection” exhibited at the gallery in April 1945.
  In the cataloguing for <em>Lost Object</em> was the artist’s intent, “It is still
  my earnest desire, some day while the eye is ticking away during a conversation,
  to lift my hammer and with one well-aimed blow to completely demolish the metronome.”
  Anti-Dada demonstrators attending the 1957 Dada exhibition at the Galerie de l'Institut
  in Paris removed <em>Lost Object</em> and destroyed it. <br><br>Some years later,
  Man Ray collaborated with artist Daniel Spoerri, who had founded his publishing
  house Edition MAT (multiplication d’art transformable), Paris in 1959. Spoerri was
  a pioneer in producing “multiples,” or editions of three-dimensional art objects
  and specialized in kinetic works. Spoerri produced Man Ray’s <em>Lampshade</em>,
  in 1965 and subsequently Edition MAT recreated <em>Lost Object</em>, this time with
  the title <em>Object indestructible</em> in an edition of 100. In 1970, Man Ray
  authorized another 40 objects to be produced by Luciano Anselmino of Galleria il
  Fauno, Turin and Milan. This next iteration of the object, the edition from which
  the current lot is part, was called <em>Perpetual Motif</em> and featured Lee Miller’s
  eye as a double printed image, made to blink as the pendulum swings. <em>Perpetual
  Motif</em> was followed by <em>Do Not Destroy,</em> the last lifetime edition of
  100 issued for the New York Cultural Center’s 1974 retrospective.</p>"
