  sculptural <em>œuvre</em>, characterized by polished steel tubes suspended with
  cables, was so consistent throughout his forty-year career that his work transcends
  any one art movement or category. As a young boy in Oregon, Snelson enjoyed building
  models and replicas, though it was his love of painting that led him to enroll at
  Black Mountain College in 1948 to study with Josef Albers. Albers recognized and
  encouraged Snelson's affinity for sculpture before he came under the tutelage of
  Buckminster Fuller. Fuller inspired Snelson's renewed interest in geometry in structures.<br><br>Snelson's
  earliest sculptures were experiments in the balance between tension and compression.
  He developed self-supporting structures where each of the objects in the composition
  were carefully constructed to rely on the assembly as a whole, and not an external
  prop to maintain integrity. The present work, though mathematical and complex, is
  comprised of simple components arranged harmoniously in an aesthetic composition.
  Snelson's sculptures have ranged from monumental towers to small "Atom Sculptures"
  (Snelson would explore atomic models throughout his career). By the time Zabriskie
  Gallery showed his work in 1981, Snelson was exhibiting internationally and had
  won several awards. Zabriskie Gallery continued to exhibit the artist in 1986 in
  New York and Paris and in New York in 1990.</p>
