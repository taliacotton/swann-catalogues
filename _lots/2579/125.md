  00188-O-2021.<br><br>Provenance: Acquired from Julien Levy, New York.</p><p>Exhibited:
  "Man Ray: Objects of My Affection," Zabriskie Gallery, New York, January 23-February
  23, 1985. <br><br>Just as Duchamp found success in re-creating his readymades at
  Galleria Schwarz in Milan in the 1960s and 70s, Man Ray also had multiples made
  from his lost original objects. The two artists worked closely with Arturo Schwarz
  in these replications, with the knowledge that the multiples would allow the artist
  to hold more complete exhibitions of his <em>œuvre </em>and further his legacy.
  <br><br>In order to defamiliarize the viewer with an object, Man Ray used repetition
  with some variation. To subvert the meaning of a hand iron, Man Ray used the iconic
  <em>Cadeau</em>, an iron with tacks affixed to the sole in 1921. To reference the
  original readymade and its later replicas, Man Ray later created two other iron
  readymades, <em>Le Fer rouge</em> (1966) and <em>Phare de la harpe</em> (1967).
  Keeping in the Dada tradition, the title of the present work is an anagram, an exercise
  in visual and literal meaning.</p>'
