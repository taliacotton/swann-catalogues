  Acquired from Julien Levy, New York.<br><br>Just as Duchamp found success in re-creating
  his readymades at Galleria Schwarz in Milan in the 1960s and 70s, Man Ray also had
  multiples made from his lost original objects. The two artists worked closely with
  Arturo Schwarz in these replications, with the knowledge that the multiples would
  allow the artist to hold more complete exhibitions of his <em>œuvre </em>and further
  his legacy. <br><br>In order to defamiliarize the viewer with an object, Man Ray
  used repetition with some variation. To subvert the meaning of a hand iron, Man
  Ray used the iconic <em>Cadeau</em>, an iron with tacks affixed to the sole in 1921.
  To reference the original readymade and its later replicas, Man Ray later created
  two other iron readymades, <em>Le Fer rouge</em> (1966) and <em>Phare de la harpe</em>
  (1967). Keeping in the Dada tradition, the title of the present work is an anagram,
  an exercise in visual and literal meaning.</p>"
