  in Paderborn, Germany, Bergmann-Michel was an early espouser of Constructivism.
  She started making collages by 1915 and from 1917-20 studied at the Weimar Hochschule
  für Bildenden Kunste under the German painter Walther Klemm (1893-1957). Throughout
  her career, she introduced innovations to the collage medium, including incorporating
  poetry and being among the first artists to utilize photography. Together with her
  husband, Robert Michel (1897-1983), she became known as a pioneer of the use of
  using photographs in collage. In 1920, the couple moved to Vockenhausen, near Frankfurt,
  Germany, where she continued her work in photo-collages and ink drawings in the
  Constructivist style, however, during World War II her artistic waned until the
  political climate was safer for her to continue to make and promote abstract art.</p>'
