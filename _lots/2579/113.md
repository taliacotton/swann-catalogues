  was born in Buenos Aires, the daughter of a Scottish father and American mother.
  Educated in Britain as a child, she studied art under Henry Tonks (1862-1937) at
  the Slade School of Art. Inspired by André Breton’s (1896-1966) manifesto, she painted
  her first surrealist work in 1930. She exhibited with the Surrealists in England
  and abroad, including at the 1936 International Surrealist Exhibition at the New
  Burlington Galleries in London, where she was the only British woman to be included.
  Throughout her career, she worked in painting, collage, photography, and sculpture,
  incorporating imagery from the natural world, found objects and classical art. While
  she at times rejected the label “Surrealist” she believed in the playful nature
  of art and gained a reputation of being among the most adventurous and influential
  artists of the Surrealist movement in Britian.</p>'
