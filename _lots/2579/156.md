After his studies, he won a Guggenheim Fellowship and traveled extensively throughout Europe, meeting artists such as Wassily Kandinsky and Fernand Léger, which cemented his interest in pursuing abstraction as an art form. Returning to New York, he worked as a commercial photographer professionally to survive, while continuing to create his own asbstract art before dedicating himself exclusively to his career as an artist in 1948.
