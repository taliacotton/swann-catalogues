  Lisson Gallery, London.<br><br>During mid-1980s, Opie was a recent graduate of Goldsmiths
  College and had already had his first one-person show at Lisson Gallery, London.
  He was identified as part of the New British Sculpture Movement and was making loosely
  painted steel sculptures that drew from his observation of everyday objects, rendering
  them with humor and wit in a cartoonish style. As he developed as an artist, his
  work grew more simplified, larger and stylized, expanding his <em>ouevre</em> to
  include paintings and works that incorporate technology and digital imagery.</p>"
