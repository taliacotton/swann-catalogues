He was identified as part of the New British Sculpture Movement and was making loosely painted steel sculptures that drew from his observation of everyday objects, rendering them with humor and wit in a cartoonish style.  As he developed as an artist, his work grew more simplified, larger and stylized, expanding his <i>ouevre</i> to include paintings and works that incorporate technology and digital imagery."
