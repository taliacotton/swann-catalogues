DESCRIPT: EUGÈNE ATGET (1857-1927)
CROSSHEAD: Le Soldat Laboureur par Lemaire (Tuileries, Paris).
TYPESET: "<p><br>Albumen print, the image measuring 215.9x177.8 mm; 8½x7 inches, with
  Atget's title and inventory number, in pencil, on verso. Circa 1910.</p><p>Atget's
  <em>fin de siècle</em> photography was exhibited alongside Berenice Abbott's New
  York imagery at the newly-opened Galerie Zabriskie, Paris as early as 1977, representing,
  extraordinarily, the first commercial exhibition for the French photographer. Abbot
  and Atget are inextricably linked, Abbott first encountering the elderly French
  photographer's work in 1925 at the Man Ray Studio. After Atget’s death, in 1927,
  she collaborated with Julien Levy, of New York’s Julien Levy Gallery, to buy most
  of Atget’s negatives and prints, bringing them back to New York in 1929.  Abbott’s
  initiative preserved Atget's archive, which, given its influence on the avant-garde,
  has become an important chapter of Abbott’s legacy.</p>"
