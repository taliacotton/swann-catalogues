This image depicts the artists Christo and Raymond Hains in front of the Eiffel Tower. A wrapped horse is collaged into the image, possibly Hains' work <i>Néodada emballé par Christo</i>, a horse in planks and posters, later wrapped by Christo, which was put on display in front of the Museum of Modern Art in Paris for the 1963 Salon des Comparaisons."
