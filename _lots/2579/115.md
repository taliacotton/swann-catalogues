  Rotterdam, September 24-November 7, 1971, number 142 (presented in its original

  in its original condition);; "Man Ray: Objects of My Affection," Zabriskie Gallery,
  New York, January 23-February 23, 1985.<br><br>The original object <em>New York</em>
  was conceived in the eponymous city in 1920. Man Ray replaced olives in a cylindrical
  glass jar, his original concept to memorialize New York and its soaring skyscrapers,
  with steel balls in a glass test tube and brought it with him to Paris in 1921,
  where he told the French customs officer that the jar would give him the illusion
  of having something to eat. The first version has been destroyed. <br><br>In 1925,
  Ray recreated <em>New York</em> and called it <em>New York II</em> (alternately
  titled <em>Export Commodity</em>, <em>Roulement Habile</em>, and <em>New York 20</em>).
  Zabriskie Gallery, New York acquired this 1925 version from Juliet Man Ray, Paris.
  This version was broken and replaced by Zabriskie to be shown in the 1988 exhibition
  "Man Ray-The New York Years." There was also one replica created in 1962 and the
  present work created in 1965. The present work from 1965 was also in the collection
  of Juliet Man Ray and acquired by Zabriskie. <br><br>In 1973, Man Ray would direct
  the edition of 9 with a printed linen tape label from Studio Marconi, which had
  produced multiples for Ray in the past. These were made by Lucien Treillard, Paris,
  Man Ray''s assistant who had sourced the glass tubes and ball bearings.</p>'
