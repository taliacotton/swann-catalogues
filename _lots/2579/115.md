Man Ray replaced olives in a cylindrical glass jar, his original concept to memorialize New York and its soaring skyscrapers, with steel balls in a glass test tube and brought it with him to Paris in 1921, where he told the French customs officer that the jar would give him the illusion of having something to eat.  The first version has been destroyed. <br><br>In 1925, Ray recreated <i>New York</i> and called it <i>New York II</i> (alternately titled <i>Export Commodity</i>, <i>Roulement Habile</i>, and <i>New York 20</i>).   Zabriskie Gallery, New York acquired this 1925 version from Juliet Man Ray, Paris.  This version broken and replaced by Zabriskie and shown in the 1988 exhibition \"Man Ray-The New York Years.\"  There was also one replica created in 1962 and the present work created in 1965.  The present work from 1965 was also in the collection of Juliet Man Ray and acquired by Zabriskie.  <br><br>In 1973, Man Ray would direct the edition of 9 with a printed linen tape label from Studio Marconi, which had produced multiples for Ray in the past.  These were made by Lucien Treillard, Paris, Man Ray's assistant who had sourced the glass tubes and ball bearings."
