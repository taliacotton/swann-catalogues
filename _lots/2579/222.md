TYPESET: "<br>Oil on paper.  180x260 mm; 7⅛x10¼ inches.  Signed, dated, titled and dedicated \"to Virginia\" in felt-tip pen and ink, verso.  1984.<br><br>Resnick trained at the Pratt Institute, New York, where he studied commercial art, before transferring to the American Artists School to focus on painting.  Among the first generation of the New York School artists, he was friends with Abstract Expressionists such as Arshile Gorky and Willem de Kooning.  Resnick sought to dissolve form and image, employing the sculptural elements of the paint.  He eclipsed the traditional modes of Abstract Expressionsim in the mid 1940s and created dense and heavily impastoed paintings that sometimes weighed more than 300 pounds.  His foray into the materiality of paint was predictive of artists such as Cy Twombly and Frank Stella who focused on process and an \"all-over\" approach to developing a canvas."
