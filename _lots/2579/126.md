Man Ray became obsessed with Miller's lips and spent two years painting <i>l'Heure de l'Observatoire </i>, the 1934 oil on canvas of Miller's monumental disembodied floating lips (held by a private collection). Her lips would also appear in the lead and rope 1933 object <i>Lovers</i> and in the illustrated anthology of poems by Paul Éluard, <i>Les mains libres</i>.  It was during this post-break up that Man Ray would create his <i> Object indestructible </i>, the metronome with Miller's eye on the ticking arm.  <br><br>Late in his career, and long after Man Ray and Miller reconciled as friends, he worked with several publishers to create editions of his early readymades.  <i>Lovers</i> was reproduced in an edition of 9 by Lucien Treillard in 1973; <i> Object indestructible</i> was issued as a multiple in 1965, 1970, and 1974; and <i>A l'Heure de l'Observatoire</i> would be reproduced as a limited edition print.  Ray also created new, original designs for editioned multiples to coincide with the revivals of his earlier concepts.  The outline of Miller's lips were applied to <i> Lèvres d'Or</i>, the title being a play on the French words \"lèvres\" (lips) and \"livres\" (book)."
