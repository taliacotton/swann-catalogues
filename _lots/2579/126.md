  Objects of My Affection," Zabriskie Gallery, New York, January 23-February 23, 1985.<br><br>Provenance:
  Acquired from Marion Meyer, widow of the art dealer Marcel Zerbib, Paris. <br><br>After
  Lee Miller left Man Ray for New York in 1932, he used art to cope with his despair.
  Man Ray became obsessed with Miller''s lips and spent two years painting <em>l''Heure
  de l''Observatoire</em>, the 1934 oil on canvas of Miller''s monumental disembodied
  floating lips (held by a private collection). Her lips would also appear in the
  lead and rope 1933 object <em>Lovers</em> and in the illustrated anthology of poems
  by Paul Éluard, <em>Les mains libres</em>. It was during this post-break up that
  Man Ray would create his <em>Object indestructible </em>, the metronome with Miller''s
  eye on the ticking arm. <br><br>Late in his career, and long after Man Ray and Miller
  reconciled as friends, he worked with several publishers to create editions of his
  early readymades. <em>Lovers</em> was reproduced in an edition of 9 by Lucien Treillard
  in 1973; <em>Object indestructible</em> was issued as a multiple in 1965, 1970,
  and 1974; and <em>A l''Heure de l''Observatoire</em> would be reproduced as a limited
  edition print. Ray also created new, original designs for editioned multiples to
  coincide with the revivals of his earlier concepts. The outline of Miller''s lips
  were applied to <em>Lèvres d''Or</em>, the title being a play on the French words
  "lèvres" (lips) and "livres" (book).</p>'
