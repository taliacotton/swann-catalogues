  Acquired from Marion Meyer via art dealer Marcel Zerbib, Paris. <br><br>Exhibited:
  "Man Ray: Objects of My Affection," Zabriskie Gallery, New York, January 23-February
  23, 1985.<br><br>After Lee Miller left Man Ray for New York in 1932, he used art
  to cope with his despair. Man Ray became obsessed with Miller''s lips and spent
  two years painting <em>l''Heure de l''Observatoire</em>, the 1934 oil on canvas
  of Miller''s monumental disembodied floating lips (held by a private collection).
  Her lips would also appear in the lead and rope 1933 object <em>Lovers</em> and
  in the illustrated anthology of poems by Paul Éluard, <em>Les mains libres</em>.
  It was during this post-break up that Man Ray would create his <em>Object indestructible
  </em>, the metronome with Miller''s eye on the ticking arm. <br><br>Late in his
  career, and long after Man Ray and Miller reconciled as friends, he worked with
  several publishers to create editions of his early readymades. <em>Lovers</em> was
  reproduced in an edition of 9 by Lucien Treillard in 1973; <em>Object indestructible</em>
  was issued as a multiple in 1965, 1970, and 1974; and <em>A l''Heure de l''Observatoire</em>
  would be reproduced as a limited edition print. Ray also created new, original designs
  for editioned multiples to coincide with the revivals of his earlier concepts. The
  outline of Miller''s lips were applied to <em>Lèvres d''Or</em>, the title being
  a play on the French words "lèvres" (lips) and "livres" (book).</p>'
