DESCRIPT: NANCY KOENIGSBERG (1927 - )
CROSSHEAD: Enclosure II.
TYPESET: "<p><br>Coated copper wire. 1330x690 mm; 52⅜x27⅛ inches (excluding base).
  1991.</p><p>Koenigsberg combines her interest in textiles and her New York environment
  to produce wire sculptures assembled of woven, knotted grids of copper, steel, or
  aluminum wire. The woven wire elements in her sculpture, like fabric, fold onto
  themselves, while the armature endeavors to hold true to three dimensions, the entire
  work, like a spider's web, a tribute to strength found within delicate structures.
  Koenigsberg has exhibited internationally and her works can be found in multiple
  distinguished public and private collections. Her first solo exhibition at Zabriskie
  Gallery, New York, was held in 2006.</p>"
