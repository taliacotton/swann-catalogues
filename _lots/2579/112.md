  1917-20 studied at the Weimar Hochschule für Bildenden Kunste under the German painter
  Walther Klemm (1893-1957). Throughout her career, she introduced innovations to
  the collage medium, including incorporating poetry and being among the first artists
  to utilize photography. Together with her husband, Robert Michel (1897-1983), she
  became known as a pioneer of the use of using photographs in collage. In 1920, the
  couple moved to Vockenhausen, near Frankfurt, Germany, where she continued her work
  in photo-collages and ink drawings in the Constructivist style, however, during
  World War II her artistic output waned until the political climate was safer for
  her to continue to make and promote abstract art.</p>'
