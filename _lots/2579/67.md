DESCRIPT: RAPHAEL SOYER (1899-1987)
CROSSHEAD: Rooftops in Cape Cod.
TYPESET: "<br>Watercolor and pencil on cream wove paper.  232x283 mm; 9⅛x11⅛ inches.
  \ Signed in ink, lower left recto.  Circa 1925-30.<br><br>Soyer was born in Russia
  and immigrated to New York at the age of twelve. He studied at Cooper Union, the
  National Academy of Design and with Guy Pène du Bois (1884-1958) at the Art Students
  League. He is known as a Social Realist, depicting the daily struggles of those
  living in New York City.  His chosen subject matter became especially poignant at
  the onset of the Great Depression, and, after he began to exhibit his work in the
  late 1920s, he cemented his reputation among the top realist painters of the 20th
  century.<br><br>His time spent at Cape Cod, however, reveals a different side of
  the artist.  He traveled there throughout his life where he visited friends, including
  Edward Hopper (1882-1967), and allowed him to experiment with pure landscape scenes.
  These works diverge from his figural, social realist work and show a colorful and
  modern approach to depicting the vivid New England scenery."
