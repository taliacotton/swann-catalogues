  Parisien.</em><br><br>Laure Albin-Guillot's work is not easily categorized. She
  produced well-known portraits of celebrities of her day, as well as modernist nudes,
  microphotography of fauna, still lifes, landscapes, and portfolios of work in tandem
  with noted French writers (offered here as well as lot 140). Her visual approach
  is best characterized as semi-pictorialist, with soft, luxurious values and a quiet
  gaze, her technical skill rendering the imagery in both beautiful and precise terms.
  She published and exhibited widely, and had the first one-person exhibition at the
  Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1925, which garnered her increasing attention and helped
  establish her reputation. Her fashion work appeared in <em>Vogue</em> (the first
  in 1922), and other imagery was published in both <em>Vu</em> and <em>Arts &amp;
  Metiers Graphiques</em> magazines. She was named president of the French Société
  des Artistes, among other key posts, and served as president of the Union féminine
  des carrières libérales et commerciales, an organization bent on supporting the
  interests of women in professional life.</p>"
