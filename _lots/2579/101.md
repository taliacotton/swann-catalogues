  Roszak titled "Theodore Roszak: Photograms" was held at Zabriskie Gallery, New York
  from October 9-November 10, 1984. He was also exhibited in Paris in 1986, which
  coincided with a book published by Zabriskie Editions.</p><p>Theodore Roszak was
  a Polish-born American artist who experimented in several mediums including photography,
  sculpture, painting, and print making throughout his career. During a fellowship
  in Prague, Roszak was introduced to the aesthetics and ideology of Constructivism.
  He explored the Constructivist movement mainly through three-dimensional structures
  created from plaster, metal, and wood. Roszak was first introduced to the practice
  of photography in the 1930s when he began photographing his sculptural work in the
  studio. Inspired by Moholy-Nagy, Roszak quickly began experimenting with photograms
  and incorporated his constructivist style into his photographic compositions. Virginia
  Zabriskie was drawn to artists who could successfully demonstrate the link between
  sculpture and photography and the similarity of their depiction of formal compositional
  elements. Zabriskie was an early supporter of Roszak''s career and continued to
  work extensively with the Theodore Roszak Estate.</p>'
