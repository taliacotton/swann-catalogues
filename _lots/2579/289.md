  with Foncuberta''s signature and date, in pencil, on mount recto. 1989.<br><br>From
  a series exhibited at Zabriskie Gallery, New York titled "Joan Fontcuberta: Paper
  Gardens," April 10-May 22, 1991. Fontcuberta was exhibited by Galerie Zabriskie,
  Paris as early as 1983.</p><p>A disrupter, an activist, and a provocateur, Fontcuberta
  is perhaps best understood as a conceptual artist. His diverse body of work uses
  photography--the artistic medium most frequently associated with a neutral truth--and
  creates believable fictions, elaborate hoaxes, and beautiful alternate realities.
  At its core, each of his multi-layered series question authority and our relationship
  with subjective truth, in imagery that is at times pesudo-documentary, at times
  Surrealist, and at times lyrically beautiful. Born in Barcelona, Spain, Fontcuberta
  is the recipient of the Hasselblad Award. His best known series are titled <em>Fauna</em>,
  1987 (which purports to discover a zoologist''s work and catalogues unusual animals)
  and <em>Sputnik</em>, 1997 (which investigates a Russian cosmonaut''s disappearance).</p>'
