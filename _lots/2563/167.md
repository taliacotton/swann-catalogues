[...] The argument [in <i>De Circulatione</i>] is not as tightly worked out as in <i>De Motu Cordis</i> but weaves around the theme of the movement of the blood in the arteries and veins and its immediate cause and manner. The points discussed are chosen to answer specific criticisms or to refute alternative notions.\" (Keynes, pages 73-74)<br><br>Keynes 8; Krivatsy 15333.; Russell 357."
