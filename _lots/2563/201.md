He consulted a manuscript of Cleomedes' work from the Cardinal Fran√ßois de Joyeuse's (1562-1615) library. Cleomedes was an ancient Greek astronomer and author of <i>On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies</i>, a blend of philosophy and science from a Stoic perspective. Through his extensive verbatim references to Posidonius of Rhodes (135-51 BCE), he has effectively preserved the work, which has not come down to us through any extant manuscripts. Cleomedes' work is valuable for its accurate obersvations on lunar eclipses, and the earliest clear explantion of the Sun and Moon Illusion, i.e., why the rising and setting bodies look larger at the horizon than they do when fully risen, even though their sizes do not change. Even this he attributes to Posidonius."
