The astronomer explores the relative merits of the heliocentric model in the form of a dialogue, as indicated by the title. Three characters present different viewpoints. Salviati is a heliocentric Copernican, Sagredo is neutral, and Simplicio is an adherent of the Aristotelian/Ptolemaeic system that places the earth at the center of the universe. The arguments are mathematical, complicated, and at times speculative. Galileo sketches out his important theory of inertial frame of reference, a concept that has held up over the centuries, and much of the work is prescient and accurate. As an early work, it also contains unresolved loose ends, keeping subsequent scientists and observers on the job.<br><br>Carli-Favaro 38, 180; Cinti 215, 109; Riccardi I 513."
