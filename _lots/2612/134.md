at-a-glance: "24¼x18½ inches, 61½x47 cm. Brown & Bigelow, St. Paul."
TYPESET: "With the kind of realistic detail most often seen in the Homefront scenes by Norman Rockwell, Schlaikjer depicts a young pilot in his leather flying jacket, rising from pastel-hued clouds above a squadron of B-29 Superfortresses, B-17 Flying Fortresses, and B-26 Marauders. More romantic than war-like, he holds a bomb while looking off towards a distant, more promising future. It is patriotic in both its use of a line from the American National Anthem and proud, powerful American imagery. Zeman frontis, Pollack p. 21."
