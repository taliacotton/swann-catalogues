TYPESET: "One in a series of conservation posters produced Douglas Aircraft in the early 1940s. \"A material conservation program was adopted at all plants to conserve, properly segregate and salvage materials. North America effectively reduced waste and spoilage, not only of materials, but also of machinery and equipment. Rejected parts and inactive materials were directed into other manufacturing channels, while materials which could be re-used in aircraft production were segregated and salvaged for use in the plants\" (The Aircraft Yearbook 1943, p. 271.)  \"Since its creation in July, 1940, the Material Conservation Program . . . has been able to reduce the scrap 10.6 per cent in sheet dural and aluminum. This is an approximate saving of 120,000 pounds of sheet material alone, enough to make 20 attack bombers.  It is estimated that in 1941 over half a million  pounds of material can be saved  by continuing the practices which have been set up around the plant\" (Douglas Airview, November, 1940, p. 34). These posters, printed to hang in the factories and administrative and corporate offices were not printed in large numbers which accounts for their scarcity. We have located only three other examples of this rareposter, one in the Bancroft Library, one in the archives of the Hoover Collection and the final held by the National Archives."
