at-a-glance: "40¼x30 inches, 102¼x76¼ cm."
TYPESET: "The expression, \"Tell that to the Marines,\" had originally been an insult, implying that the Marines would believe anything, but Flagg's poster turned that around and made it into a veritable battle cry. The image of a man reading a chilling headline and instantly preparing to face off against an opponent, is a visceral allegory of an angry America springing to action to preserve what is right in the world. Flagg p. 82, Rawls p. 166, Theofiles 72, Borkan p. 35."
