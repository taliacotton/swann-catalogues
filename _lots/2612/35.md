at-a-glance: "41¼x26¾ inches, 104¾x68 cm. Schmidt Litho., San Francisco."
TYPESET: "A rare World War I poster, this image was printed locally in San Francisco, so it would have had a much smaller distribution than images meant for national exposure. Using the visual psychology of James Montgomery Flagg's I Want You (1917), this image depicts General Pershing. It was likely published following the release of the United States War Film \"Pershing's Crusaders.\" Not in Rawls, not in Theofiles, not in Borkan."
