TYPESET: "Published by the U.S. Food Administration, this poster reminds immigrants of the beauty, promise and joy of arriving in New York harbor (optimistically rendered here with a red, white and blue rainbow and golden buildings) in an appeal for them to help their adopted country save food to feed the Allies. \"The central figure, with one hand firmly placed on a food basket, motions with his other hand toward a ship being loaded -- a gesture that impresses the viewer with the urgency of providing food for Europe.\" (Magnes p. 48) To reach as broad an immigrant base as possible, this poster appeared in several different languages including English, Yiddish, Italian and Hungarian. This is the English version. Magnes p. 49, Rawls p. 113, Theofiles p. 94 (var), Borkan p. 60, Gallo p. 92."
