at-a-glance: "38Â¼x26 inches, 97x66 cm. Studio Mingozzi, Bologna."
TYPESET: "Mingozzi spent his entire life and career in Bologna, where he founded the Alta Studio in the 1920s and then opened an eponymously-named studio in the 1930s. His posters uniformly reflected his Modernist view of design. Among his largest clients were Barbisio hats, Ebano shoe polish and a variety of different brands of liquor, including Campari. This strong image from later in his career promotes the company's soda with its stylized, signature bottle. The image manages to both represent the bottle as an inverted cocktail glass and catch the viewer's eye with the vibrating background."
