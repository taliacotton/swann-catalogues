TYPESET: "One of the few photomontage images in the \"Think America\" series. \"A group of Rochester industrialists . . . were concerned about the mental sabotage of their workers by the infiltration of subversive propaganda from outside their plants . . . Out of this problem our company developed what is known as the 'Think American' program. It is now in use in over 5,000 of the largest industrial, business, financial, and educational organizations in nearly every state. 'Think American' consists of weekly illustrated messages, each of which points up vividly and intelligently a virtue or advantage of the American way of life. Plants display these posters near time clocks, in restrooms, and at other points of heaviest employee traffic. In these days when we are doing everything in our power to speed material preparedness and to prevent material sabotage, the need for mental preparedness and the prevention of mental sabotage cannot be overlooked. 'Think American,' we feel, is helping to do both of these jobs. Its messages are now reaching 7 million people weekly throughout the nation\" (The Rotarian, September 1941, p. 3-4)."
