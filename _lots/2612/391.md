at-a-glance: "47¾x31¾ inches, 121¼x 80½ cm. Harford, Paris."
TYPESET: "Jazzy male performing duos were extremely fashionable in the thirties, following the success of the Americans Layton and Johnston. In France, the most famous were Pills and Tabet, and Charlie and Johnny (Charlie being Charles Trenet). Featured alongside him on this rare poster is Eddie Barclay (1921-2005) who at the time was working as a jazz pianist before becoming a French recording industry magnate. We will probably never know anything about PSIM, as it was certainly a pseudonym. Designed using a cut-out technique, this is a stylized, clean, elegant and simple image of the performers."
