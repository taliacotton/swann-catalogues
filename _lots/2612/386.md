at-a-glance: "62x45 inches, 157½114 cm."
TYPESET: "A sallow-faced woman in a red dress sways to the music of a red-lipped jazz band, while a gleeful green monster (the spectre of cocaine) watches over the hill of Montmartre, and Moulin Rouge at his elbow. Although little is known about this play, the image does not appear to be a glorification of the drug, which was legal in Paris throughout the 1920s. The clear resemblance of the characters pictured to Edith Piaf, Harpo Marx and Al Jolson further suggest that this play, whether a morality tale or not, was celebrity-based."
