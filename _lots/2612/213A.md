TYPESET: "One of Porsche's strongest selling points was the company's impressive results in competitions. For over thirty years starting in 1951, posters for the Porsche competitions were designed by Eric Strenger. He revolutionized the design of racing posters by introducing modern typography and photography. Early in his career, he worked with photographs by other artists, but as his career matured, so did his style, and he began to work with his own photographs, which allowed him much more freedom of expression. As Reinhard Seiffert wrote, \"he wanted to inform, not illustrate. Instead of adding something, he took things away. Instead of dramatizing, he abstracted. In this way the information moved into the foreground as a specific aim of the poster\" (Porsche p. 15). Porsche p. 28."
