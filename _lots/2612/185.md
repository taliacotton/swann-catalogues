TYPESET: "An influential artist and teacher, Dow's own work was heavily influenced by the \"floating world\", (ukiyo-e), of the Japanese woodblock masters and other Asian art influences, as well as the Arts and Crafts movement of William Morris in England. A teacher at many of America's most prominent Art Institutions (Pratt Institute, the Columbia University Teachers College, the Arts Students League, and his own Ipswich Summer School of Art) Dow's influence spread far and wide, including Georgia O'Keeffe, who was his most famous pupil. Perhaps his most lasting gift to the art world was his 1899 manual Composition: A Series of Exercises in Art Structure for the Use of Students and Teachers, which became a standard art text at schools across the nation. Dow's most famous poster, reproduced in the Maitres de l'Affiche was for the magazine entitled Modern Art (Maitres pl 36). This scarceky seen image is for a magazine that was one of several titles that Arts and Crafts practitioners used to propagate their art (others included Keramic Studio, The Craftsman, The Hobbyhorse, Knight Errant and The Studio) and appears in at least two different colors advertising different months of the publication. Virginia p. 39 (var)."
