TYPESET: "Martin studied at the Art Institute of Chicago. He is best remembered for the over 400 record jackets he designed for Folkways and other labels. His work is hung at the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum, and the Smithsonian. At the outbreak of World War II, the armed services continued its long-held practice of rigid discrimination against African-Americans. This practice included not only a stubborn reluctance to acknowledge the capabilities of the African-American soldier or sailor, but also a shameful denial of their courage and bravery. When Pearl Harbor was attacked on 7 December, navy mess-man Doris \"Dorie\" Miller was serving on the USS West Virginia when it was struck. Before abandoning ship with the rest of the crew, he braved enemy fire to carry a wounded officer to safety, and though not trained for combat, he took up one of the ship's anti-aircraft guns, possibly downing at least one enemy plane. \"It wasn't hard. I just pulled the trigger and she worked fine. I had watched the others with these guns. I guess I fired her for about fifteen minutes. I think I got one of those Jap planes. They were diving pretty close to us.\" He eventually received a Navy Cross but only after intense pressure from the black press back home. Miller was killed when his aircraft carrier was sunk in the Pacific in November of 1943. Nelson, p. 80, War Posters 262, Pollack p. 118."
