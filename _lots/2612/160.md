TYPESET: "Hofbauer studied at the Prague School of Arts and Crafts and also at the Prague Academy where he was taught by Vojtech Hynais, one of the great Czech classical painters at the end of the 19th century. Primarily known as a painter, Hofbauer also designed several posters. Hana Kvapilova was the preeminent Czech actress of her era. Immensely popular, she was revered as both a national treasure and as a major force in the emancipation of women in Czech theatrical roles. Hofbauer's early posters combined \"symbolist effect and Japonist techniques,\"(Howard p. 93). Here, no longer adhering so strongly to symbolism, Hofbauer depicts the actress dramatically staring at the viewer through the clever concept of her reflection in a mirror. Rare. We have only sold two other copies at auction in the last 20 years. Mascha 140, Prazsky Chodec p. 36, Cesky Plakat p. 43, Czech Posters p. 20, Prague 1900 126, Art Nouveau p. 272."
