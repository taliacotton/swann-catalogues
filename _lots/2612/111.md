at-a-glance: "28½x40 inches, 72½x101½ cm. U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington D.C."
TYPESET: "\"Designed for display in munitions factories, this striking image demonstrated the importance of their task to munitions workers far removed from the front's deadly dangers\" (Meehan Military Posters cat. 17). Done in typical Rockwell realism (he even borrowed a machine gun from the army to get the exact details), this exhausted, battle-scarred and solo machine gunner is sitting in his torn fatigues on a yellow slope, out of ammunition and palpably desperate. A far cry from Rockwell's pleasant front porch and ice cream parlor scenes, but equally as poignant. Posters for Victory p. 72, Judd C. 10, Rhodes p. 173, Pollack p. 165."
FOOTNOTE: "Condition B: water stains in upper right margins; repaired tears in margins, some into image; creases and rippling in margins and image; pencil notation in bottom margin."
