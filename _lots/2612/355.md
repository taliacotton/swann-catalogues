TYPESET: "In the years following World War II the possibility of comerical supersonic aviation began to take hold. In the early 1960s 18 different airline companies, including Continental, placed non-binding orders to add the airship to their existing fleets.  In 1963 Continental ordered three of the aircraft and this poster presents those aircraft, 7 years in the future, bearing the Continental \"Golden Jet\" livery, with gold tail and thin gold pinstrips along the fuselage.  This futuristic projection of their fleet is presented within the confines of an imaginary airport, equally as modernistic as the vessels themselves, reminiscent of Eero Saarinen's TWA Flight Center, which had opened at New York's JFK airport in 1962.  Ultimately, all the orders for Concrdes were ultimately canceled, except for Air France and British Airways, the only airlines to succesfully operate the Concorde commercially. Continental's poster represented an aviation dream that never came ot fruition for the company."
