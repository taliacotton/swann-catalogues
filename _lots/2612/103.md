at-a-glance: "36x22 inches, 92x58 cm. U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C."
TYPESET: "Atherton was a graphic designer and a surrealist painter. He is best remembered for his poster promoting the 1939 New York World's Fair, and his award-winning Buy a Share in America poster from 1941. He went on to design many covers for The Saturday Evening Post, Fortune and Holiday. This image, with America's resources arrayed on a flag whose perspective leads the viewer's eye towards the rifle and military equipment in the foreground, is a gem of American mid-century design. For a government publication, which by definition would have been produced in very large numbers, this poster is uncommon."
