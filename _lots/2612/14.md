When World War I began, in 1914, the extent of the American Air Force was \"12 officers, 54 enlisted men and six aircraft\" (http://www.af.mil/history/overview.shtml). On May 24, 1918, President Wilson removed responsibility for American military aviation from the Signal Corps and placed it within two agencies under the supervision of the U.S. Army: the Bureau of Aircraft Production and the Division of Military Aeronautics. These two branches were officially recognized as the U.S. Army Air Service.  Rawls 174, Theofiles 28."
