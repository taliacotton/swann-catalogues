TYPESET: "Zdenka Cerny was one of three daughters from the family with whom Mucha lived in Chicago in 1906. A prodigal cellist, she was slated to go on a European tour in 1914, but the tour was canceled due to the outbreak of World War I. While \"the Art Nouveau ornamentation is virtually absent, other than a circle of stylized fleurs-de-lis in white behind Zdenka, and a similar white-outline garland around her cello,\" Mucha's style is present in the woman's hair and the collar of her dress (Rennert / Weill p. 346).
