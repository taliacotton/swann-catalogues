TYPESET: "Affectionately known as \"The Green Devil,\" Cappiello struck a chord with this poster that has reverberated down through the decades. Mischievous, arcane and naughty, this green figure highlighted in purple is popping a cork from a brown bottle, and makes for an image that flirts with something sinister in a way that manages to be charming and compelling. One of the most memorable icons in Cappiello's visual legacy.  Cappiello / Rennert 114, Encyclopedie de l'Affiche p. 61, Drink 85, Cappiello 266, Jenever p. 29."
