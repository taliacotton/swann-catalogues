TYPESET: "Throughout his career Metlicovitz produced over one hundred posters for commercial products, exhibitions, operas and the movie industry. His work can be separated into two distinct styles each one as superb as the other in terms of technical rendering; one is appealing and charming (this is the approach he used to advertise products), the other one, for official exhibitions is more academic and emphatic. Here, as if growing organically from the border of the image, a young beauty is entranced by the smell of the perfume she is holding. Like an allegorical blossom she is such a pure product of the natural world around her that even the butterflies believe the scent to be that of a flower, and flutter towards it. The natural color scheme, the garland of flowers in her lap and the surrounding flora and fauna all create a calm and voluptuous atmosphere. This is the second of two printings, the first, in 1898, was printed by Ricordi in Milan. Manifesti Italiani p. 61, Masters, p.120, Ricordi 154, Gold 8, Capolavori Manifesto Liberty 16, Femme 110."
