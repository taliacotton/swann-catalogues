TYPESET: "Oysters are shipped all over Europe in la caisse Simon, cartons which help retain freshness and \"arrive in perfect condition.\" Cappiello's design captures that freshness and adds a veneer of class which can only have made the manufacturer happier with their choice of artist.  Two simple bands of color, one gray and the other light blue in the background create a wide open, outdoors effect in which a brightly-clad, elegant lady is indulging in an oyster, freshly shucked.  The sea air catches the dresses of the two women further evoking the fresh, outdoors feeling. Variations of this poster also exist without the text in the top margin. Cappiello / Rennert 9, Cappiello 235, DFP-II 128, Wine Spectator 193."
