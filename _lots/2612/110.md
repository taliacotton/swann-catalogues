TYPESET: "In 1939, while still in France, Carlu designed a poster promoting the \"Anglo-French Day for the benefit of the combatants and their families,\" featuring two soldiers in profile, a theme which he clearly replicated in this 1941 poster, but with far more effect and impact. \"A visual analogy is found between a machine gun and a rivet-gun\" (Word & Image p. 61), driving home the connection between homefront workers and front-line soldiers.
