TYPESET: "As part of their activism for peace (which included bed-ins) John Lennon and Yoko Ono launched a major media campaign in 1969, for which they purchased space on large billboards in 12 major cities around the world. The giant signs they pasted up read \"War is Over / If You Want It / Happy Christmas from John and Yoko.\" Flyers with the bold, simple typographic message were distributed to passersby, and smaller posters were printed to be hung in windows of private homes. A savvy and prescient move (some cynics have said it was done for profit), the campaign received a tremendous amount of media coverage. Nevertheless, John and Yoko provided a generation of war-weary youth a new slogan to embrace. In 1971, they released a song \"Happy Xmas (War is Over),\" which has become a staple on holiday playlists. The other text variant reads \"Happy Christmas from John & Yoko\" at the bottom. The Poster 664 (var), MoMA 2964.2008."
