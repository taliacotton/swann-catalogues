TYPESET: "Most famous for his children's book illustrations, Parrish was nonetheless a \"remarkable draughtsman, who energetically and successfully mixed fantasy and reality to create a luminous dreamworld that, for all its strangeness, is precisely rendered\" (Parrish intro). He studied art at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and then at the Drexel Institute under Howard Pyle. \"The great charm in Mr. Parrish's work lies in its curious individuality. It may well be said that he has felt the influence of many predecessors in design, but his work is stamped with his own originality. He is adroit enough effectively to conceal his borrowings if indeed he has borrowed at all. He realises for us a fairyland, undiscovered until he became its pioneer . . . every fact in the picture in itself appears to be tangible: it is the atmosphere with which Mr. Parrish invests all his facts which produces the sense of aloofness and elusiveness which one feels as one looks at his drawings. . . . [here] the figures of the three golfers are almost photographic in their realism. The undulating landscape, with its trees and cottage in the middle distance, is quite delightful\" (The Poster and Art Collector, by Charles Hiatt, Vol. IV). Keay p. 22, Virginia p. 32, Art of Parrish 443."
