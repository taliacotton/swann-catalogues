TYPESET: <p>Color pastel on fine sandpaper, 1935. 508x355 mm; 22x15¼ inches. Signed
  and dated in pencil, lower right.<br><br>Norman Lewis drew this beautiful drawing
  after visiting the 1935 landmark exhibition <em>African Negro Art</em> at the Museum
  of Modern Art in New York. <em>African Negro Art</em> curated by James Johnson Sweeney,
  was intended to show modernism's roots in African Art. A photograph of the sculpture
  by Walker Evans, who was commissioned to document the large exhibition of over six
  hundred works, is included in the catalogue (fig. 319). The exhibiton had a profound
  effect on Lewis - he created a wonderful series of detailed and colorful pastel
  drawings of the sculptures he had seen.<br><br>This drawing is of an ancestral sculpture,
  a carved wood figure of a woman made by the Bangwa, a people indigenous to western
  Cameroon. Now best known as the <em>Bangwa Queen</em>, it is one of the most famous
  and important African sculptures. The sculpture was taken from the Bangwa by a German
  colonial agent before Germany had colonised the area. After being in the collection
  of the Museum für VölkerkundeIt in Berlin, it was sold privately to an art dealer
  in 1926 who then sold it to Helena Rubenstein in the 1930s who lent it to the MoMA
  exhibition. Collector Harry Franklin then acquired the sculpture from Rubenstein
  in 1966, and then his daughter sold the work for a record price at Sotheby's in
  1990, where it was acquired by the Dapper Foundation in Paris. Man Ray took several
  photographs of the <em>Bangwa Queen</em> figure in 1934, including Surrealist images
  of it posed alongside a nude model. <br><br>The exhibition <em>African Negro Art</em>
  clearly resonated with Lewis and other African American artists of the Harlem Renaissance
  and were influenced by philosopher Alain Locke's exhortation to find artistic models
  in African art. In 1935, Lewis also joined the 306 group of writers and artists
  in Harlem who met in the studios of Henry Bannarn and Charles Alston, and was a
  founding member for the Harlem Artist Guild with Alston, Augusta Savage, Arthur
  Schomburg and Elba Lightfoot. The MoMA exhibition, which was on view from March
  18 to May 19, attracted many artist visitors including Alston, Romare Bearden, and
  Gwendoline and Jacob Lawrence.<br><br>Other known examples of these extraordinary
  1935 drawings include <em>Baule Mask</em>, <em>Ivory Coast Baule Mask</em>, <em>Bobin
  (Boobin, Loom, Baule</em>, <em>Carved Bobbin (Guru)</em> and <em>Dan Mask</em>,
  four of which were included in <em>Procession, The Art of Norman Lewis</em>, his
  2015 retrospective curated by Ruth Fine, and <em>Untitled (Head of a Mule, French
  Sudan)</em>, sold at Swann Galleries on December 10, 2020. Fine pp. 24-25, 248.</p><h6><strong><img
