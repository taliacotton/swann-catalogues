TYPESET: "<p>Oil on thick wove paper, circa 1973. 736x1041 mm; 29x41 inches. Signed
  in ink, lower right.</p><p>This large work on paper is an excellent example of Norman
  Lewis's final body of work in abstraction. Norman Lewis added more high key and
  saturated colors in his painting after a visit with his wife Ouida to Jack Whitten's
  residence in Crete in the summer of 1973. The development of the <em>Seachange</em>
  series with more abstract compositions of vibrating, concentric circles followed
  in 1975. That year he was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation fellowship,
  and the following year in the fall of 1976, Lewis had his first retrospective, with
  63 artworks included in <em>Norman Lewis: A Retrospective</em>, at The Graduate
  School and University Center of City College, New York. Fine pp. 181, 245-46 and
  267.</p>"
