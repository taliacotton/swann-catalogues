TYPESET: "<p>Acrylic on cotton canvas, 1988. 508x610 mm; 20x24 inches. Signed and
  dated in acrylic, verso.</p><p>This vibrant canvas is from the artist's 1988 <em>Bahia</em>
  series. Inspired by a visit to Jack Whitten in Crete in 1971, Ed Clark began to
  travel to various foreign countries to paint - including Nigeria, Martinique, Brazil
  and Morocco - through the 1980s. Another work from this series in the collection
  of the Museu de Arte Moderna Bahia.</p><p>Ed Clark was a trailblazing, important
  international figure in post-war and contemporary abstract painting over a sixty
  year career. Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, he studied at the Art Institute of
  Chicago from 1946 to 1951, and in 1952 at the Academy de la Grande Chaumière in
  Paris, where he lived until 1958. George Sugarman then persuaded him to return to
  New York to help found the Brata Gallery with Ronald Bladen, Al Held and others.
  Clark showed there until 1966, when he returned to France for three more years.
  He has acknowledged the influence of the paintings of Nicolas de Stael and the music
  of Miles Davis and Charlie Parker, and later the gestural abstractions of Hans Hartung
  and Pierre Soulages. He exhibited widely internationally and his paintings are in
  numerous institutional collections including the Art Institute of Chicago, Brooklyn
  Museum, Detroit Institute of the Arts, Museum of Modern Art, Pérez Art Museum, Saint
  Louis Art Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>"
