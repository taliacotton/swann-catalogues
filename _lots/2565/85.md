A very good, vibrant impression with bright colors.<br><br>Wadsworth Jarrell was one of the founding members of the African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists (AfriCOBRA) when the artist collective formed in Chicago in 1968. Wadsworth Jarrell made the screenprint <i>Revloutionary</i> during his first year teaching at Howard University in 1972. AfriCOBRA members often made prints based upon their paintings, making these popular visual messages affordable and accessible to a wider audience. Jarrell's screenprint is made after his same-titled 1971 painting; the now iconic portrait of Angela Davis is in the permanent collection of the Brooklyn Museum."
