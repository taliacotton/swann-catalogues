  with the exhibition labels on the base underside. Catlett lent this sculpture from
  her personal collection to the exhibition.<br><br><em>Pensive</em> is a significant
  sculpture by Elizabeth Catlett, cast in bronze after one of her earliest figures.
  The original plaster <em>Pensive</em> followed the theme of the four terracotta
  figures exhibited in her 1946 first solo exhibition at the Barnett-Aden Gallery
  in Washington, DC: <em>Negro Woman</em>, <em>Tired</em>, <em>Cold</em> and <em>Frustration</em>.
  Catlett importantly first represented modern Black women in her <em>Negro Woman</em>
  series - a narrative of identity, experience and representation. These figures show
  the physical nature and toll of their struggle. With her rolled up sleeves, crossed
  arms and leaning posture, <em>Pensive</em> is an expressive representation, sharing
  the modern simplified and angular features found in Catlett''s <em>Woman</em>, 1942,
  oil on canvas, and <em>Negro Woman</em>, lithograph, 1945.<br><br>Catlett did not
  begin making bronze sculpture until the early 1960s. She made the mold and cast
  the first bronze of <em>Pensive</em> after the 1946 plaster figure in 1967. Samella
  Lewis recorded both the 1946 plaster and a 1978 cast in a list of Catlett''s sculpture
  in her 1984 monograph <em>The Art of Elizabeth Catlett</em>. The final cast, 10/10,
  was made in 1995 for the Broad Art Museum (then the Kresge) at Michigan State University
  - their archives includes a letter written by Catlett describing the later casting
  in Mexico. The original plaster figure is visible in the 1980 photographs of Catlett''s
  studio that illustrate Lewis''s monograph. Casts of <em>Pensive</em> are in the
  collections of the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, Michigan State University, the
  Atlanta Life Insurance Company, and the Walter O. Evans Collection of African American
  Art at the Savannah College of Art and Design. Gedeon pp. 17-18, 43; Lewis pp. 33,
