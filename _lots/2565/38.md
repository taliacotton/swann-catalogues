Catlett lent this sculpture from her personal collection to the exhibiton.<br><br><i>Pensive</i> is a signfiicant sculpture by Elizabeth Catlett, cast in bronze after one of her earliest figures. The original plaster <i>Pensive</i> followed the theme of the four terra cotta figures exhibited in her 1946 first solo exhibition at the Barnett-Aden Gallery in Washington, DC: <i>Negro Woman</i>, <i>Tired</i>, <i>Cold</i> and <i>Frustration</i>. Catlett importantly first represented modern Black women in her <i>Negro Woman</i> series - a narrative of identity, experience and representation. These figures show the physical nature and toll of their struggle. With her rolled up sleeves, crossed arms and leaning posture, <i>Pensive</i> is an expressive representation, sharing the modern simplified and angular features found in Catlett's <i>Woman</i>, 1942, oil on canvas, and <i>Negro Woman</i>, lithograph, 1945.<br><br>Catlett did not begin making bronze sculpture until the early 1960s. She made the mold and cast the first bronze of <i>Pensive</i> after the 1946 plaster figure in 1967. Samella Lewis recorded both the 1946 plaster and a 1978 cast in a list of Catlett's sculpture in her 1984 monograph <i>The Art of Elizabeth Catlett</i>. The final cast, 10/10, was made in 1995 for the Broad Art Museum (then the Kresge) at Michigan State University - their archives includes a letter written by Catlett describing the later casting in Mexcio. The original plaster figure is visible in the 1980 photographs of Catlett's studio that illustrate Lewis's monograph. Casts of <i>Pensive</i> are in the collections of the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, Michigan State Univiersity, Atlanta Life Insurance Company, Atlanta, GA and the Savannah College of Art and Design, Savannah, GA, gift of Dr. Walter O. Evans. Gedeon pp. 17-18, 43; Lewis pp. 33, 84, 172, 188-89."
