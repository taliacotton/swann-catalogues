  McIver depicts herself here in blackface make-up, standing alone in an ambiguous
  setting, gazing pensively at the viewer. Dressed in a maid’s uniform (her mother
  was a domestic worker), she wears a clown’s wig and white gloves, cradling a pair
  of black-skinned dolls in her arm. Her shoes and socks are those of a child. On
  the wall behind her hangs a portrait of a grinning circus clown. The scene recounts
  a recurring dream from McIver’s childhood. She explained: “As a child, I had dreamed
  of becoming a clown to escape my black skin, poverty, and the housing project I
  once called home. In high school, she was a pre-professional clown and considered
  attending clown college. She says it was her "liberation.” For McIver, the self-portrait
  is a journey in self-revelation in which she confronts black stereotypes while seeking
  her own identity as a woman and an African American.</p>'
