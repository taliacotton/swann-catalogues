  Pindell pursued her passion in art from a young age, with extensive lessons in fine
  art. She received a BFA from Boston University in 1965, and an MFA from Yale University
  in 1967. Pindell moved to New York, and began working in the Art''s Education Department
  at the Museum of Modern Art. Howardena Pindell first engaged with hole-punched circles
  by counting and numbering each one, then placed them over a gridded form — often
  the lines of graph paper — and added embellishments such as acrylic, watercolor,
  glitter, and even baby powder.<br><br>Pindell''s affinity with numbers and grids
  grew from the influence of her father — a mathematician who often wrote down figures
  in a gridded journal. In 1972, Pindell was one of 22 co-founders of the A.I.R. Gallery
  in New York, which was the first artist-directed gallery for women artists in the
  United States. By 1977, she was appointed associate curator in the Prints and Drawings
  Department at MoMA.<br><br>In 1979, just when she was beginning the next phase of
  her career as a professor of art at SUNY, Stony Brook, Pindell was injured in a
  serious car accident that left her with acute memory loss. Her subsequent 1980-81
  <em>Oval Memory</em> series transformed postcards saved from her global travels
  into elaborate assemblages that helped reconstruct her memories.<br><br> This beautiful
  example of the Howardena Pindell''s <em>Oval Memory Series</em> assemblage is the
  first of this important series to come to auction. Her <em>Autobiography: Oval Memory
  #1</em> is in the collection of the artist; <em>Oval Memory Series II: Castle Dragon.</em>
  is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>'
