year: 1985
TYPESET: "<p>House paint on found plywood, circa 1985. Approximately 965x838 mm; 38x33
  inches. Signed in paint, lower right<br><br>The son of an Alabama sharecropper and
  farm overseer, Mose Tolliver was the youngest of seven sons born into the Ike Tolliver
  family of twelve children. Living in Montgomery, married and raising his own family,
  Mose Tolliver began painting after a work accident left him handicapped in the mid
  1960s. An early admirer who brought his work to public attention was Mitchell Kahan,
  former curator at the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts. In 1981, the museum mounted
  a one-man exhibition of Tolliver's work. He then was featured in <em>Black Folk
  Art in America 1930-1980</em>, the important national exhibition at the Corcoran
  Gallery in 1983. He has since become one of the most enduring and widely collected
  self-taught artists of his generation, and painted actively until 2002.</p>"
