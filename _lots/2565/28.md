  53.<br><br><em>Artist’s Studio Party</em> is the largest and most significant painting
  by Joseph Delaney to come to auction. This important painting is part of his expressive
  body of work recording the lives of New Yorkers. Joseph Delaney gives the viewer
  a fascinating view of the downtown artist''s scene - painting in thin layers with
  a dark, somber palette.<br><br>Joseph Delaney became a long time resident of the
  West Village art scene shortly after moving to New York to join his brother Beauford
  in 1930. Frederick Moffatt describes how Delaney lived in various garrets and lofts
  within a small area of the Village and Soho between 1931 and 1959. In 1940, Delaney
  lived on Sullivan Street, near West Third Street. Sam Yates wrote this painting
  was inspired by a party he gave friends earlier at 26 Bond Street.<br><br>In 1930,
  Joseph Delaney first studied at the Art Students League where he studied figure
  drawing with George Bridgman and human anatomy with Thomas Hart Benton. From 1934
  to 1940, Delaney worked on various WPA projects in New York including the Index
  of Design for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Pier 72 mural, and with Norman
  Lewis on the <em>Story of the Recorded Word</em> mural at the New York Public Library.
  In 1942, Delaney eventually join the easel division just before the WPA was disbanded,
  and was also awarded a Julius Rosenwald travel fellowship of $1,200, which he used
  to work and travel down the Eastern coast, from Maine to South Carolina.<br><br><em>Artist’s
  Studio Party</em> inclusion in the Studio Museum in Harlem exhibition <em>Invisible
  Americans</em> helped cement Joseph Delany''s reputation as an important figure
  of the 1930s. In his <em>Artforum</em> review of February of 1969, Robert Pincus-Whitten
  hailed Joseph Delaney; "a single artist of tremendous merit was revealed to me in
  terms of a developed, tough, and by moments self-mocking Expressionism". Pincus-Whitten
  describes <em>Village Studio Party</em> as a "scene of group camaraderie an image
  of what must have seemed then to be the daring option of depicting a white girl
  dancing with a black man." In another studio painting, <em>Artist''s Party</em>,
  circa 1942, Delaney includes himself seated at a poker game in an artist''s apartment
  alongside a figure he later identified as Jackson Pollock. Both paintings are described
  in Frederick C. Moffatt''s biography <em>Life and Times of Joseph Delaney, 1904
  - 1991</em> and are recognized for taking the viewer into the "sanctified" space
  of the artist''s studio. Moffatt p. 167; Moffat/Yates p. 53; Pincus-Whitten p. 66;
