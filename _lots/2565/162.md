  Saar''s <i>Sojourn</i> is an excellent, evocative collage of carefully selected
  objects steeped in symbolic meaning. In her exhibiton essay, LeFalle-Collins notes
  how Saar uses the plush surface of the tapestry in <i>Sojourn</i> to construct an
  intimate interior and a spiritual space. The striking central imagery of the messenger
  bird flying while shackled in chains symbolizes the obstacles faced by African Americans
  in their pursuit of freedom. LeFalle-Collins p. 44.'
