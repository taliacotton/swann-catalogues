  <em>Sojourn</em> is an excellent, evocative collage of carefully selected objects
  steeped in symbolic meaning. In her exhibiton essay, LeFalle-Collins notes how Saar
  uses the plush surface of the tapestry in <em>Sojourn</em> to construct an intimate
  interior and a spiritual space. The striking central imagery of the messenger bird
  flying while shackled in chains symbolizes the obstacles faced by African Americans
  in their pursuit of freedom. LeFalle-Collins p. 44.</p>"
