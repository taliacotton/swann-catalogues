  Davson was born in Georgetown, Guyana and received a BFA degree from Pratt Institute
  (1980), Brooklyn, New York. He was the co-founder of Aljira, a Center for Contemporary
  Art, with artist Carl E. Hazlewood in Newark, NJ, in 1983, and served as its founding
  director until 2016. Davson's thinking is heavily influenced by the anti-colonial
  politics of the Caribbean and the intellectuals of that period. These include writers
  and activists like Aimé Césaire, Martin Carter, Frantz Fanon and Walter Rodney.
  Since 1996, his series of paintings, <em>Bad Cow Comin'</em> is his attempt to negotiate
  the roots of identity in a terrain of loss and desire - it is a response to strong
  memories from his childhood in Guyana of performances in which men masqueraded from
  house to house on Christmas Day. These carnivalesque characters serve as metaphors
  for the people of the African Diaspora who survived transatlantic slavery because
  of their resiliency.<br><br>“The visual and the performative in the Caribbean are
  explicitly linked; the brilliance and innovation of the costumes are tied to the
  music and the meaning of the performance. Masking traditions embody both the colonizer
  and the colonized. In them we witness both “civilized” European and “savage” African
  religious expressions; the maintenance of the status quo, and the opposition to
  it that is expressed in ritual defiance. There is menace in the air, and there is
  exuberance. Davson can still hear the pitch and rattle of the kettle drum in his
  head.” —Belinda Edmondson Ph.D.</p>"
