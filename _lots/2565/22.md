DESCRIPT: RICHMOND BARTHÉ  (1901 - 1989)
CROSSHEAD: Stevedore.
year: 1937
TYPESET: '<p>Cast bronze with a dark brown patina on a green marble base, 1937. 778x508x368
  mm; 30⅝x20x14½ inches (not including marble base). Cast in 1986 under the supervision
  of the artist and the Richmond Barthé Trust. Incised with artist''s signature, date,
  numbered 3/8 and incised "©", right base edge.<br><br>This iconic work by Richmond
  Barthé is an important and large bronze by the artist made at the peak of his career.
  Margaret Vendryes describes this sculpture of muscular dock worker standing on a
  i-beam in great length - he is both "Barthé''s most virile male figure" and "a personal
  statement". With the epitome of a chiseled physique and commanding presence, the
  figure of a longshoreman was elevated to great heights by the artist. Barthé had
  created both a new type of masculine presence in his oeuvre, and a new depiction
  of a powerful black man.<br><br><em>Stevedore</em> was a non-commissioned work made
  from the artist''s own funds. Vendryes describes how Barthé kept it out of storage
  and with him when he moved. He later gifted his cast to the St. Ann''s Parish Public
  Library in Jamaica. This later cast has a longer rope that extends above the hand.
  This is only the second time a cast of <em>Stevedore</em> has come to auction: another
  was sold at Swann Galleries on October 15, 2017. Another example of this 1985 casting
  is the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Vendryes pp. 92-96.</p>'
