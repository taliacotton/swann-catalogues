TYPESET: "Oil on masonite board, 1937. 559x711 mm; 22x28 inches. Signed and dated in oil, lower left.<br><br>Provenance: private collection, Louisiana.<br><br>This winter river scene is an excellent example of the landscapes of John Wesely Hardrick. The Indianapolis artist spent his career in Indiana, painting lush landscapes, in addition to portraits and still lifes. Hardrick studied at the John Herron Art Institute until 1918, before fellow Indiana artists William Edouard Scott and Hale Woodruff enrolled. He later shared a studio with a young Woodruff in Indianapolis in 1924. Though Hardrick won the Harmon bronze (first place) medal in 1927, frequently exhibited at the Harmon Foundation, and was awarded a WPA mural commission, his work received little attention during his lifetime. Today, his paintings are in the collections of the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Indiana State Museum and Hampton University."
