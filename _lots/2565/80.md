  left.<br><br><em>Girl in a Garden</em> is an exquisitely layered example of Romare
  Bearden's mid-career collage. The figure is comprised of a now familiar Bearden
  photo montage of African masks, in contrast with the textures and color of the rest
  of the composition. Bearden created faces using cut images of African masks and
  sculptures from magazines and exhibition catalogues beginning with his first series
  of collages in 1964. According to Helen Shannon in her 2007 essay "African Art and
  Cubism, Proto-Collage and Collage in the Work of Romare Bearden," Bearden used African
  sculpture as an aesthetic source even earlier in his 1940s paintings. Like his 1940s,
  quasi-cubist paintings, Bearden returned to African sources for large figure compositions
  again in the late 1960s.<br><br>This collage shows Bearden's integration of all
  types of his collage medium--patterned paper, fabric, hand colored paper, and distressed
  solid colored papers. Bearden also introduced surface abrasion as early as 1968,
  with more solid areas of color and less collage photographic images, and added fabric
  into his collage with works like <em>She-BA</em>, 1970, <em>Patchwork Quilt</em>,
  1970, and <em>Conjunction</em>, 1971. In <em>Girl in a Garden</em>, Bearden deftly
  balances a composition of rectangular areas of color that emphasize the two-dimensional
  surface; with this spatial flatness, Bearden references both the history of Dutch
  and ancient Chinese painting, with an awareness of contemporary abstraction.<br><br>Bearden
  has created a new type of icon with these masked or conjure figures, mythological
  African Americans born of the Diaspora and the New World. Bearden continued to explore
  the subject of myth in his heroic <em>Odysseus</em> series that he began this same
  year. Tweedy p. 22.</p>
