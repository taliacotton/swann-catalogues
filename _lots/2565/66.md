  lower right recto. Signed, titled and inscribed "N.Y.C." and "22 East 8th St., N.Y.C.
  10003" in ink, upper stretcher bar verso.<br><br>Exhibited: <em>Hale Woodruff: An
  Exhibition of Selected Paintings and Drawings, 1927 - 1967</em>, Leob Center, New
  York University, New York, May 15 - June 8, 1967; <em>Hale A. Woodruff: Paintings,
  Prints and Watercolors</em>, Morgan State College, Baltimore, May 21 - June 14,
  1968. Hale Woodruff''s retrospective was a celebration of his retirement from New
  York University as a Professor Emeritus that year.<br><br>This large canvas is an
  excellent example of Hale Woodruff''s postwar painting in which he describes landscape
  and natural phenomena within the idiom of Abstract Expressionism. This significant
  and striking canvas shows Woodruff''s continued evolution as an abstract painter
  through the 1960s. In addition to continuing his <em>Celestial Gate</em> series,
  Woodruff now creates some of his most abstract painting with his landscapes. Woodruff''s
  landscape is a beautiful, modernist composition - bold, horizontal strokes define
  layers between bands of both earthy and jewel-like colors. Another canvas from 1967,
  Woodruff''s <em>Figure</em>, is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of
  Art, New York.</p>'
