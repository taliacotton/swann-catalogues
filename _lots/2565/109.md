  Incised signature and title, lower right.<br><br>Winfred Rembert is an artist from
  Cuthbert, Georgia who lives and works in New Haven, CT. His artwork, painted on
  carved and tooled leather, displays memories of his youth—Black life in the Jim
  Crow South. His artistic vision calls forth vivid scenes from Georgia cotton fields
  and colorful characters from the juke joints and pool halls of Cuthbert. They also
  reveal his encounters with racial and police violence in the aftermath of a civil
  rights protest, and the seven years he spent on a Georgia chain gang. His paintings
  have been exhibited at museums and galleries around the country, including the Yale
  University Art Gallery, the Hudson River Museum, and The Adelson Galleries in New
  York. In 2011 Rembert was the subject of an award-winning documentary film, <em>All
  Me: The Life and Times of Winfred Rembert</em>, by Vivian Ducat, and in 2015, Rembert
  was honored by Bryan Stevenson’s Equal Justice Initiative. Recently, in November,
  2019, NPR also aired a segment produced by StoryCorps on the artist. Bio courtesy
