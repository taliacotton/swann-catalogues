  lower right verso.<br><br>Romare Bearden's <em>Obeah</em> watercolors are an important
  series in the artist's late career. They represent both a culmination of his artistic
  freedom and expression in the medium, and his awareness of the traditions of his
  second home on the Caribbean island of St. Martin. The role of the Obeah is a well-known
  part of Afro-Caribbean communities and cultural history - typically, a woman who
  practices spiritual, herbal and mystical healing in her villlage.</p>"
