  on paper by Nelson Stevens from his important period of work with the Chicago-based
  art collective AfriCOBRA. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Stevens received his BFA in
  painting from Ohio University in Athens, OH in 1962, and his MFA in 1969 from Kent
  State University in Kent, OH. After brief teaching stints in Cleveland, Ohio, Stevens
  was hired as Assistant Professor of Art at Northern Illinois University where he
  taught from 1969 to 1971. It was at this time that Stevens was invited to join the
  newly formed art collective AfriCOBRA - the group was founded by Chicago artists
  Jeff Donaldson, Jae Jarrell, Wadsworth Jarrell, Barbara Jones-Hogu, and Gerald Williams.
  Stevens exhibited in every AfriCOBRA art exhibition beginning with <em>AfriCOBRA
  I</em> at the Studio Museum. He then was a Professor of Art at the University of
  Massachusetts from 1972 to 2003. Today artworks by Nelson Stevens are in many museum
  collections including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Brooklyn Museum, the National
  Museum of African American History and Culture, the Smithsonian Institution and
  the Tate Modern. His artwork was also featured in the recent important traveling
  museum exhibtion <em>Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power</em> organized
  by the Tate Modern.<br><br>The University of Maryland Art Gallery has requested
  the loan of this work for an upcoming Nelson Stevens retrospective exhibition (dates
  pending after the exhibition was postponed in 2020).</p>"
