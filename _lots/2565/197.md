  Kosrof is a contemporary painter and sculptor who has an international reputation

  he completed a BFA with distinction in 1972. Then, as a Ford Foundation Talent Scholar,
  he was awarded an MFA in 1980 from Howard University in Washington, DC. Over the
  past four decades, Wosene (his professional name) has developed his use of the script
  forms – <em>fiedel</em> – of his native Amharic as a core element in his paintings
  and sculptures. His artwork today is in many institutional collections including

  of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, the Newark Museum, the Neuberger Museum of Art, the Indianapolis
