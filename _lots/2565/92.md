Gedeon notes while the prints were numbered /25, there were only 12 signed impressions, 3 signed artist's proofs and 4 signed trial proofs, with two estate-stamped proofs. Another impression printed in brown ink, numbered 3/25, is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.<br><br>The subject of the etching anticipates Charles White's painting <i>Black Pope (Sandwich Board Man)</i>, oil wash on board, 1973, acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in 2013. Curator Esther Adler in her 2017 monograph <i>Charles White Black Pope</i> describes how the idea of a black pope was floated in 1970s media, including a 1973 <i>Encore</i> magazine article, a copy of which is found in Charles White's papers at the Archives of American Art.
