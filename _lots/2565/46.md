  on the frame back.<br><br>Illustrated: Lowery Stokes Sims. <em>The Challenge of
  the Modern: African American Artists, 1925-1945</em>, p. 67.<br><br>This striking
  urban abstraction by Charles Alston is an important painting, an outstanding and
  scarce example of a large modernist canvas. Alston''s vision is rooted in his earlier
  urban nocturnes of the late 1940s, <em>Harlem at Night</em>, 1948 and <em>Untitled
  (New York Cityscape)</em>, circa 1948. Both Alston and Norman Lewis shared a new
  vision of fragmented urban life against a dark, atmospheric ground. By 1950, Alston
  had transitioned completely into abstraction, and his <em>Untitled</em>, oil on
  canvas, 1950, entered in the national juried competition, <em>America Painting Today</em>,
  was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1951.<br><br>While it was dated
  1948 in the Studio Museum exhibition, this large canvas, with its loaded and broad
  brushstrokes appears closer in date to 1960. His 1962 solo exhibition at Dunbarton
  Galleries in Boston featured <em>Tenements</em>, a very similar 40x50 inch oil painting,
  illustrated on the cover of the brochure. By 1960, Alston was painting and exhibiting
  compositions inspired by the urban environment seen from his Harlem at night for
  inspiration - including paintings like <em>Across the River</em>, 1959. His exhibition
  at Kenekeleba Gallery included other similar paintings like <em>Nocturne (Across
  the Hudson River)</em>, 1964 and <em>Tenements</em> again, now titled <em>Demolition</em>
  and not dated. Jennings pp. 23 and 62.</p>'
