MacArthur Foundation Achievement Award, known as the MacArthur “genius” grant, at the age of 27. The same year, Walker also had her first traveling solo institutional exhibition <i>Presenting Negro Scenes Drawn Upon My Passage Through the South and Reconfigured for the Benefit of Enlightened Audiences Wherever Such May Be Found, By Myself, Missus K.E.B.
