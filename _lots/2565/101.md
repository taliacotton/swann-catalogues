TYPESET: "<p>Color pastels on thin tan wove paper, 1951. 457x610 mm; 18x24 inches.
  Signed and dated in pastel, lower left. With a partial sketch of a landscape in
  charcoal on the verso.<br><br>This beautiful, colorful drawing is a very scarce
  example of Beauford Delaney's modernist work in color pastels from the early 1950s,
  and shows his move toward abstraction at the time. In 1950, Beauford Delaney had
  a two month fellowship at Yaddo the artist and writer's colony near Sarasota Springs.
  In 1951 he did several paintings and drawings that approached complete abstraction.
  Delaney then returned again to Yaddo in November of 1951. Soon after Delaney decided
  to leave New York, and following his friend James Baldwin immigrated to Paris in
  1953.</p><p>Delaney's landscapes in color pastels are seldom seen at auction. Swann
  sold another Deleaney color pastel <em>Greenhouse at Yaddo</em>, 1950 in 2017. Two
  other early 1950s landscapes in color pastels were once in the collection of Delaney's
  friend, famed caricaturist Al Hirschfeld; one was sold in Doyle in 2013, and another,
  also dated 1951, was sold at Cornette Saint Cyr, Paris in 2018.</p>"
