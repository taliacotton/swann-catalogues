The late Frannie Ness and Gary Oleson were the proprietors of Waiting for Godot Books of Hadley, MA, which specialized in rare American and English books, including African American literature.<br><br>This beautiful, colorful drawing is a scarce example of Beauford Delaney's modernist work in color pastels from the early 1950s, and shows his move toward abstration at the time. In 1950, Beauford Delaney had a two month fellowship at Yaddo the artist and writer's colony near Sarasota Springs. In 1951 he did several paintings and drawings that approached complete abstraction. Delaney then returned again to Yaddo in November of 1951. Soon after Delaney decided to leave New York, and following his friend James Baldwin immigrated to Paris in 1953."
