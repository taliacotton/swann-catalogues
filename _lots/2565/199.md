  State University in 2001, and her MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design in
  2004. Recent solo exhibitions include <em>Deana Lawson: Centropy,</em> Kunsthalle

  grant, 2008â€“2009, the Guggenheim Fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial
  Foundation, 2013, and the 2020 Hugo Boss Prize from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.</p>"
