  is his well known portrait of the Czech-born German dancer Harald Kreutzberg (1902
  - 1968). Kreutzberg is an important figure in German ballet and modern dance whom
  Richmond Barthé befriended when he performed in New York in the 1930s. Barthé made
  several sculptures of the expressive dancer in busts and figures. Barthé himself
  had studied Martha Graham dance techniques in an effort to more fully understand
  the movement and form of dancing figures.<br><br>A plaster cast of this head was
  exhibited and illustrated in the 1974 Anacostia Museum catalogue <em>The Barnett-Aden
  Collection</em>. A similar bronze casting, the same size as this head, is illustrated
  in the 1995 <em>The Catalogue of the Barnett-Aden Collection</em> and dated "circa
  1973." Other bronze casts of this head are in the collections of the National Portrait
  Gallery, the David C. Driskell Collection, the Walter O. Evans Collection of African
  American Art, the Bernard and Shirley Kinsey Collection and the Savannah College
  of Art and Design Museum. Kinard p. 40; Auzenne, p. 42.</p>
