DESCRIPT: RICHMOND BARTHÉ (1901 - 1989)
CROSSHEAD: African Boy Dancing.
year: 1936
TYPESET: '<p>Cast bronze with a dark brown patina, 1937. Approximately 413 mm; 16¼
  inches high. Incised with the artist''s signature in the base. Cast by the Cellini
  Bronze Works, New York, with their stamp at the base rear edge.<br><br>Illustrated:
  <em>Parnassus</em>, Volume 12, Issue 3, 1940, (cast illustrated in the "collection
  of the artist"); <em>Sculpture by Richmond Barthé</em>, Harmon Foundation brochure,
  reproduced in Samella Lewis, <em>Barthé: His Life in Art</em> p. 68.<br><br><em>African
  Boy Dancing</em> is an important and strikingly beautiful bronze by Richmond Barthé
  - representing the culmination of Richmond Barthé''s significant study of the male
  figure in sculpture, anatomy and African dance in the 1930s, and his pioneering
  realization of an ideal male nude.<br><br><em>African Boy Dancing</em> shares many
  of its defining characteristics with Barthé''s iconic 1935 <em>Feral Benga</em>.
  Appearing grander than its actual height, this natural and sensual representation
  of the male figure was made at the height of the artist''s career. This lithe dancing
  figure is also part of Barthé''s groundbreaking evocation of both male and homosexual
  sexuality in early 20th century American Art. The modelling emphasizes the dancer''s
  lean physique, while the pose conveys a fluid, rhythmic movement. When seen in the
  round, Barthé''s technical expertise and attention to the totality of the figure
  is evident. Both figures also share a very expressive modelling and finish for cast
  bronze - Barthé''s 1930s bronzes wonderfully convey much of the immediacy of his
  clay model. <br><br><em>African Boy Dancing</em> is an extremely rare bronze. In
  1937, six of Barthé''s African dancer bronze figures, including <em>African Boy
  Dancing</em>, were shown in the prestigious month-long exhibition <em>Dance International,
  1900 - 1937</em> at the Rockefeller Center, New York, In 1939, the Barnett-Aden
  Gallery of Washington, DC also exhibited a cast of <em>African Boy Dancing</em>
  at Oberlin College. Another later cast of <em>African Boy Dancing</em> was included
  in the Landau traveling exhibition <em>Richmond Barthé</em> curated by Samella Lewis.
  This is only the second time that an original cast of a 1930s figure has appeared
  at auction; an early cast of <em>An African Dancer</em>, 1934, was sold at Bonham''s,
  San Francisco in 2005. Several of Richmond Barthé''s mid-career bronzes were cast
  at the Cellini Bronze Works in Brooklyn, New York: including <em>An African Dancer</em>
  and the <em>The Boxer</em>, 1942, in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago
  and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>'

FOOTNOTE: |-
  Art historian and Barthé scholar Margaret Vendryes has written extensively on Barthe's attention to detail:

  "At the height of his career, Barthé took great pains with the finish of his sculpture. Foundry work received vigilant scrutiny to ensure that the bronze was chased to a seamless finish and read true to its original clay model. The traces of pulled and smoothed clay created with fingers and tools animate figures like Feral Benga and act as a road map of Barthé's meticulous rendering methods. This practice also reflected his admiration for the late 19th century French master Auguste Rodin who left impressions on surfaces that are his signature."
