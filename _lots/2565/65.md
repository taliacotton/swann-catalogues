TYPESET: "<p>Acrylic on cotton canvas, 1966-1997. 610x610 mm; 24x24 inches. Signed,
  titled and dated in ink, verso.<br><br>Exhibited: Middendorf/Lane Gallery, Washington,
  DC, with the gallery label on the stretcher bars. According to Jonathan Binstock,
  Gilliam began having a relationship with the gallery in 1978.<br><br><em>Toyopet
  I</em>. is a dashing, experimental canvas, and one of the earliest abstract paintings
  by Sam Gilliam to come to auction. This intriguing painting dates from Gilliam's
  first period of experimentation in color field painting from 1966-1968 with his
  earliest staining of raw canvas and use of improvisation. With a similar ethereal
  atmosphere of blurred earthy colors, <em>Toyopet I</em> is painting appears closely
  related to Gilliam's <em>Light Fan</em>, 1966, in the collection of the Smithsonian
  American Art Museum, Washington, DC. Other similar, small color field paintings
  from this 1966 period include <em>So They Can</em> and <em>Autumn Points</em>; each
  share an gauzy organic flow of bands of verdant color. Then Gilliam revisited the
  stained canvas in 1997, adding daring dashes of more vibrant color, suspended in
  layers of acrylic medium. Binstock p. 163.</p>"
