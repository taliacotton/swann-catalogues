DESCRIPT: AARON DOUGLAS  (1899 - 1979)
CROSSHEAD: Head of Boy (Portrait of Langston Hughes).
year: 1926
TYPESET: Woodcut on cream laid paper, circa 1926. 120x102 mm; 4Â¾x4 inches, 1/4 to
  3/4- inch margins. Signed, titled and dated "1957" in pencil, lower margin. A later
  printing by the artist at Fisk University.<br><br>This extremely scarce print is
  a striking representation of a hero of the Harlem Renaissance by Aaron Douglas,
  a small portrait of the poet Langston Hughes as a young man. Another impression,
  titled <i>Portrait of Langston Hughes</i>, an unsigned proof, printed in brown and
  gold metallic ink, is in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The museum
  also has <i>Portrait of Countee Cullen</i>, another very similar Douglas woodcut.
  Both date from the same year as the artist's <i>The Emporer Jones</i> series of
  woodcuts. The artist later revisited these blocks, in addition to making new etchings
  like <i>Window Shopper</i> and <i>The Junkman</i>, after taking a printmaking class
  in the summer of 1955 taught by Walter Rogalksi at the Brookyln Museum Art School.
