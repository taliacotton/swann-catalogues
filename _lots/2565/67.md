  a representation of an African fertility figure within a saturated yellow color
  field painting. Delaney had an interest in African sculpture going back to his reading
  of Alain Locke's <em>New Negro</em>, and visiting artist Cloyd Boykin's Primitive
  African Arts Center in the 1930s. Having seen the influence of African art on Picasso
  and other modernist painters in both New York and Paris, Delaney often incorporated
  African motifs and figures, including <em>Earth Mother</em>, 1950 and <em>Makonde
  Figure</em>, 1952. There is also an oil on paper work that is the mirror image of
  this figure in the collection of the Knoxville Museum of Art. Leeming pp. 41 and
  102; Powell p. 58.</p>"
