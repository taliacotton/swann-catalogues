Delaney had an interest in African sculpture going back to his reading of Alain Locke's <i>New Negro</i>, and visiting artist Cloyd Boykin's Primitive African Arts Center in the 1930s. Having seen the influence of African art on Picasso and other modernist painters in both New York and Paris, Delaney often incorporated African motifs and figures, including <i>Earth Mother</i>, 1950 and <i>Makonde Figure</i>, 1952. There is also an oil on paper work that is the mirror image of this figure in the collection of the Knoxville Museum of Art. Leeming pp. 41 and 102; Powell p. 58."
