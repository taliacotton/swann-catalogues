TYPESET: "<p>Oil on linen canvas, 1981. 584x838 mm; 23x33 inches. Signed in oil, lower
  left.<br><br><em>The Balance</em> is a beautiful and evocative painting that demonstrates
  Lee-Smith's continued exploration of both surrealism and the depiction of modern
  isolation into his late career. As depicted in his <em>The Juggler #1</em>. 1961,
  collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and <em>Two Boys</em>, 1968, collection
  of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Lee-Smith continues to develop the symbolic
  imagery of balancing with figures standing on top of concrete walls in his paintings.</p>"
