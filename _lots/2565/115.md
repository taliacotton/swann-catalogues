  work by sculptor Fred Eversley. This translucent open disk in cast polyester with
  aqua and pink tones was made in the first years of what would become his trailblazing
  body of work in casting polyester. Eversley's innovative work made him a key figure
  in the developing art scene of postwar Los Angeles in the late 1960 and 70s.<br><br>Fred
  Eversley's beautiful sculptures are made from cast polyester resin, plastic and
  other synthetic materials - a pioneering practice which he developed based on his
  experiences and training as an engineer. From 1963 until 1967, Eversley was a senior
  project engineer at Wyle Laboratories, where he was responsible for supervising
  the design and construction of high-intensity acoustic and vibration test laboratories
  at NASA facilities. He attended Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh,
  and then the University of Pennsylvania School of Bio-Medical Engineering. where
  he obtained his PhD. in 1963.<br><br>Eversley moved to Venice, California, in 1964
  where he became friends with several Los Angeles artists. After a car accident,
  he retired from engineering in 1967, and become a full-time artist. Eversley's first
  solo exhibition was held at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1970, and he became
  the first artist-in-residence at the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum
  in 1977. Eversley has been the subject of recent solo exhibitions at the Rose Art
  Museum, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA in 2017 and Art + Practice, Los Angeles
  in 2016. His work is now in the permanent collections of dozens of museums; including
  the Whitney Museum of American Art, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of

  the Museum of Modern Art and Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</p>"
