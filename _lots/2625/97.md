TYPESET: "Illustration published in Oscar Wilde's <i>Salome: A tragedy in One Act.</i> (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1927.) Gouache on Bainbridge board. Image measures 500x381 mm; 19¼x15 inches, on 25x20-inch board. Not signed. Early window matte adhered to board, chip to upper right corner. <br><br>Vassos “worked in a very limited palette of black, white, silver, gray, and their intermediate shadings, always to startling effect. He illustrated relatively few authors during his active years-Coleridge, Gray, his wife Ruth Vassos, and his favorite, Oscar Wilde” (John Anzalone). Vassos published this version of Salome after creating a program cover for a 1926 stage production, and followed it with <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</i> in 1928 and <i>The Harlot’s House and Other Poems</i> in 1929. “Wilde’s despondency and eroticism were perfectly portrayed with Vassos’ restricted palette of tones and shapes” (Jim Vadeboncoeur Jr.).“Art critic C.J. Bulliet called [Vassos]… ‘the first artist since Beardsley who has paralleled Wilde” (P.K. Thomajan). The play was first published in 1894 with illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley. “The text pages of [this] edition were showered with silvery stars, an added touch that befitted this historic lady of the evening.” (Thomajan).

He wrote, illustrated and published a number of fiction books: Contempo, in 1929; Ultima in 1930; and Phobia in 1931.In 1933 he established the first internal design department for the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), and remained as its consultant until 1964, while continuing to practice independently. In 1938 he was one of the founders and the first president of the American Designers Institute. He urged the breakaway of the group from the Designers Institute of the American Furniture Mart to allow designers to work on many areas, not just furniture design. He served as its president again in 1948.In 1939 he designed the first consumer television sets for RCA that were introduced at the New York World's Fair, and he designed the theme and concept of the RCA pavilion there.With Alexander Kostellow, FIDSA among others, he developed early programs of industrial design education in the early 1940s and published Dogs are Like That in 1941. During World War II, he was with the US Army Air Corps developing camouflage techniques, and, with the forerunner of the CIA, twice entered Greece secretly by parachute to organize the underground.He was president of the Silvermine Guild of Artists in CT and was elected the first Chairman of the Board of the Industrial Designers Society of America when it was formed in 1965."
