Signed \"Richard Taylor 1945\" and titled in lower center image. <br><br>While Taylor is best known for his droll New Yorker cartoons, he was a master of science fiction and fantasy illustration. Most of that work appeared on the covers of Arkham House novels in the 1950s and 60s, though his archives have presented numerous examples of such dark, Hieronymus Bosch-like landscapes and creatures as this wonderful illustration."
