TYPESET: "Illustration featured in a print ad for Schenley's \"Cream of Kentucky\"  90 Proof Straight Bourbon Whiskey, published in <i>Collier's</i> magazine, September 10, 1938 (and possibly elsewhere). Charcoal and colored pencil on paper, backed with archival paper and tissue. Image measures 377x148 mm; 14⅞x5⅞ inches, on 15x9¾-inch sheet. Signed \"Norman Rockwell\" in red, lower left image. Cornered to window matte and archivally framed to 21½x14 inches. A copy of the magazine accompanies the artwork. The ad appears on page 71 and is printed in opposite position to the original artwork. <br><br>Provenance: Schenley Kentucky Whiskey Company, Lawrenceburg, Indiana, 1938; Rainone Galleries, Inc., Arlington, Texas; Private collection, California.  <br><br>Literature:  L.N. Moffatt, Norman Rockwell: A Definitive Catalogue, vol. I, Stockbridge, Massachusetts, 1986, pp. 522-23. <br><br>In addition to his prolific work for <I>The Saturday Evening Post</i> at this time, Rockwell was also in high demand for calendars and print advertisements. Throughout the late 1930s and early `40s, he created several illustrations for Shenley's, speaking to their ideal customer, the sensualist imbiber with \"knowing eyes\" who seeks a more luxurious style of bourbon. The copy reads: \"If you are this type you'll like this bourbon that's `Double Rich!'\" An inset panel defines and arrow points to the specific physical features of Rockwell's drawing of one such young man in the know, poking his head out from a shower curtain: \"Have you these features? Eyes - of a type who keeps calm-cool-contented; Lips - that rejoice in luxurious living.\" Presumably showering after a hot summer day, ready for a drink, as defined by the concluding copy \"For you who love to bask in the cool luxury during summer warmth . . . the `Double-Rich' Kentucky straight Bourbon in highballs is ideal . . . try it!\""
