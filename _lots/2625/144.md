Frank Baum, as well as cover designs and illustrations for numerous magazines throughout the 1920s-40s. She was successful and creative from an early age; during the depression and subsequent years, she expanded her repertoire into landscapes, needlepoint tapestry, and even fashion shoe designing. \"She was largely responsible for revolutionizing the quality of illustration in children's readers\"--Walter Reed, \"The Illustrator in America 1860-2000,\" page 165.<br><br>Towne was a prolific and successful writer and editor in his day, at the helm of such major publications as The Smart Set and Harper's Bazaar.
