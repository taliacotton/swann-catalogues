DESCRIPT: "ANNA (ANN) PETERSON ( 20TH CENTURY)"
CROSSHEAD: "\"Ada the Adventuress\" * \"Call Me.\" Two circa 1920s/30s advertisements featuring sassy young ladies."
TYPESET: "The first, advertising \"Somebodies Shaving Lotion\" features a pointy bra-clad woman in a swirl of fragrance with the copy \"Ada the Adventuress, wowed with a whiff.\" The second is of a curly-haired woman in a frilly spaghetti-strap dress and hair band, all with a valentine motif. Illustrations measure approximately 254mm; 10 inches high (width differs) on 15x11-inch sheets. Unsigned but with her business card \"Ann Peterson Fashion Illustrator now located 461 Eighth Avenue-Suite 1506 New York City BRyant 9-6774.\" <br><br>Comparing these illustrations and business card to those in the preceding lot, Peterson, had clearly achieved some more commercial and financial success - she has changed her name to Ann (from Anna), titled herself as a fashion illustrator, moved to a suite, and adopted a classier font on her business card."
