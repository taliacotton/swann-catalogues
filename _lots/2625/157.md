The first, published October 26, 1947 measures 14¼x13¼ inches. The label on verso reads: \"The child who is slow at solving simple problems may show marked improvement after being fed glutamic acid, some scientists believe. In some cases, mental development was twice as fast as before treatment.\" The second measures 19¼x13¾ inches. The label on verso reads: \"When a child, I never got to a picnic because I always got sick with anticipation.\" <br><br>Provenance: Illustration House, 1989; private collection, New York, acquired from the above. <br><br>The illustrations were clearly for a story or article on childcare. <br><br>Fox was a prolific and sought-after illustrator for her sensitive illustrations of children. She and her husband, the illustrator Charles Fox, drew all Carter's baby clothing and underwear ads. Her work became known for animated families and cute babies and appeared in <I>Family Circle, Life, Saturday Evening Post, Baby Talk, Two to Six, Women's Home Companion, Ladies Home Journal</i> and <I>Parents</i> magazines. She was also a regular illustrator of schoolbooks for Ginn and Company, the popular instructional readers. Most notably, in 1945, Dorothea illustrated Dr. Benjamin Spock's book, \"The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care\" and continued to illustrate all revisions of that book through the sixth edition in 1992."
