She is best known for her caricatures of celebrities in the worlds of theater, art, literature, politics, and law. For this image of the great modern painter among a restrospective group of his works, she admitted to finding herself \"getting right into the paintings, absorbing their spirit, content, and brushwork.\" Having put so much emphasis on Weber's work than the artist himself, she put his \"modest head and shoulders\" in the right hand corner of the work as if he were the signature\" identifying the works on the wall above him (page 170). \"The Aline Fruhauf Papers\" at the Archives of American Art research collection contains the majority of her personal correspondence and much of her art on paper."
