CROSSHEAD: "\"An American Tail\"  hand-painted limited edition cel."
TYPESET: "Hors commerce proof produced by MCA Universal / Amblin Studios. Silkscreened black lines on recto, hand-painted in color acrylic on reverse, over color print background, as issued. 343x420 mm; 13½x16½ inches, sheets. Marked \"HC 1/10\" in ink;  gold MCA Universal / Amblin Entertainment seal stamp in lower right corner of celuloid. <br><br>The image features a heartwarming scene of young Fievel and Tanya Mousekewitz gathered around Papa as he tells them stories. This is a special example of a scarce cel, produced as a very small edition of 100, since it is marked as the first HC artist's proof, which was never intended for sale. <i>An American Tail</i> is the story of the Mousekewitzes, a family of Russian-Jewish immigrant mice, which focuses on young Feivel's journey to reunite with them.  The film was a box office success and provided further proof that Don Bluth's \"upstart\" studio could be formidable competition to Disney."
