McGinnis\" in pencil, lower right. <br><br>This work was discussed and shown to the artist and his son, Kyle McGinnis, in 2017-18 but neither could pinpoint exactly where the illustration appeared. They felt that it was most likely created for one of the numerous men's magazine that McGinnis illustrated, but ultimately unused because of its risqu√© nudity."
