TYPESET: "Pen, ink, and collage on paper, circa 1970. 440x395 mm; 17¼x15½. Signed and dated \"Edward Sorel '70\" in ink, upper left image. <br><br>Provenance: Leo Castelli Gallery; Rick Meyerowitz, purchased from the above, 1972. <br><br>In this sly caricature, Sorel depicts \"Tricky Dick\" Nixon hiding his hand of cards a la actor/comedian W. C. Fields in his famous role as conman Cuthbert J. Twillie in the 1940 film \"My Little Chickadee.\" Here, Sorel reveals Nixon's hand in a visual bubble where we see that he is holding a terrible hand; a busted flush and a busted straight; his only move now is to bluff the other players at the table into thinking he holds better cards then he does."
