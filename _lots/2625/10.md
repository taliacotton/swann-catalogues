Provenance: Illustration House, 1989; private collection, New York, acquired from the above. <br><br>A charmingly irreverent illustration of Uncle Sam relaxing with a refreshing beer, his shoes casually propped up on a pile of books next to a bottle of champagne. The clear message here is that he's no fussy, high-fallutin' father of his country and prefers to kick back with a beer at the end of a hard day of democracy."
