TYPESET: "Full-page illustration for the story \"The Warmhearted Polar Bear\" by Robert Murphy in <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>, December 24, 1955, page 22.  Gouache on water color board. Image measures 406x305 mm; 16x12 inches, on  24x21Â¾-inch board. Signed \"R. Jones\" in lower right image; partially abraded SEP publisher's label on verso. A worn issue of the magazine and color copies of the story accompany the artwork. <BR><BR>The Warmhearted Bear was Jones' first major editorial commission for the Post. He was working for Cooper Studio at the time and began as a weekly salaried artist. As the studio's illustrators became more established, a status Jones achieved while there, the policy was to split commissions 50/50 with them for advertising art spots. If they landed a coveted editorial (story) assignment, the artist could keep the entire fee. Jones was delighted to have earned 12x more for this story than his previous $100 a week check (see http://todaysinspiration.blogspot.com/2009/06/bob-jones-in-grade-2-well-this-is-what.html)"
