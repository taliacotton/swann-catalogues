TYPESET: '<p>Set design by Larkin for Ostrow''s first, but unrealized musical <em>We
  Take The Town</em> by Peter Larkin, 1962, intended for production by Stuart Ostrow
  at the Broadway Theatre, New York. 560x380 mm; 22x15 inches, board. See condition
  report. <br><br>Provenance: Collection of Stuart Ostrow. <br><br>Ostrow began his
  work in music and theater as Frank Loesser''s apprentice in 1955. By 1961 he had
  become the vice president and general manager of Frank Music Corporation, working
  on The Most Happy Fella, The Music Man, Greenwillow, and How to Succeed in Business
  Without Really Trying. By the time he was 28, Ostrow decided that he had enough
  experience to try producing on his own, and he flew to London to tell Loesser in
  person that he was leaving the company to produce his first solo venture, We Take
  the Town starring Robert Preston.<br><br>While "We Take the Town," with music and
  lyrics by Harold Karr and Matt Duby, along with costumes by Motley, never made it
  to Broadway, Ostrow went on to produce a great variety of successful shows. In 1963,
  he directed and produced Meredith Willson''s Here''s Love, based on A Miracle on
  34th St. In the 1960s he also produced The Apple Tree (1966) and 1776 (1969), which
  received not only the New York and London Drama Critics Awards, but the Tony Award
  for Best Musical. (The Stuart Ostrow Papers, NYPL)</p>'
