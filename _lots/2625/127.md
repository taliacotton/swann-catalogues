TYPESET: "Set design for Ostrow's first, but unrealized musical <i>We Take The Town</i> by Peter Larkin, 1962, intended for production by Stuart Ostrow at the Broadway Theatre, New York. 560x380 mm; 22x15 inches, board. See condition report. <br><br>Provenance: the collection of Stuart Ostrow. <br><br>Ostrow began his work in music and theater as Frank Loesser's apprentice in 1955. By 1961 he had become the vice president and general manager of Frank Music Corporation, working on The Most Happy Fella, The Music Man, Greenwillow, and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. By the time he was 28, Ostrow decided that he had enough experience to try producing on his own, and he flew to London to tell Loesser in person that he was leaving the company to produce his first solo venture, We Take the Town starring Robert Preston.<br><br>While We Take the Town never made it to Broadway, Ostrow went on to produce a great variety of successful shows. In 1963, he directed and produced Meredith Willson's Here's Love, based on A Miracle on 34th St. In the 1960s he also produced The Apple Tree (1966) and 1776 (1969), which received not only the New York and London Drama Critics Awards, but the Tony Award for Best Musical.
