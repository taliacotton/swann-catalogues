  about the beautiful but very haughty princess Anna who cruelly mocks each of her
  suitors including the handsome and charming young King Thrushbeard. Finally, she
  is forced by her exasperated father, the King, to marry the next man to arrive at
  their door, who turns out to be a beggar. Their ensuing life of poverty, hard work,
  and sacrifice teach the princess a lesson and turn her into a loving and kind person.<br><br>The
  image illustrates the text: "The beggar-man led her out by the hand, and she was
  obliged to walk away on foot with him. When they came to a large forest she asked,
  ''To whom does that beautiful forest belong? ''It belongs to King Thrushbeard; if
  you had taken him, it would have been yours.'' ''Ah, unhappy girl that I am, if
  I had but taken King Thrushbeard!''"<br><br>In the end, the beggar turns out to
  be Thrushbeard in disguise, and Anna has learned to be kind and grateful.</p><p><a
