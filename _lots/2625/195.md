TYPESET: "Original illustration with inscription to his friend, Charlotte Adams on front free endpaper of Addams' book <i>Drawn and Quartered</i> (New York: Random House, 1942. First edition, lacking dust jacket). <br><br>In addition to their near-identical surnames (his with a double \"d\"), they shared the nickname \"Charlie.\" He humorously inscribed it to her thus, with a drawing of a lightly self-portraitized couple gazing at their hideous offspring, a two-headed baby with grim faces and the caption \"He looks a little like both of us, don't you think?\" and signed \"Chas Addams\" below. <br><br>Adams was a highly esteemed cookbook editor, writer, and critic. She authored the bestselling <i>The Four Seasons Cookbook</i> with James Beard for home cooks and fans of Manhattan's famous \"it\" restaurant. A bon vivant as much as a gastronome, she befriended Addams among many within the New Yorker and New York Times social circles."
