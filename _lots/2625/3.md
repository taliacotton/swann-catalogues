He pioneered the distinctive book cover style known as the \"big book look\" where the use of minimal imagery and large point, bold lettering allowed the book to stand out on the shelves. Such famous titles include Joseph Heller’s Catch-22, Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, the original hardback cover for Jaws, and Phillip Roth’s Portnoy’s Complaint.
