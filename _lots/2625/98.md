In a series of panels called 'Nationalism, Justice, Disarmament, Ethics, The Leaders,' etc., he has projected and focussed [sic] a message of tremendous impact. This book summarizes and makes clear the attitude and protest of the new America, as expressed by one of the country's best-known artists.\"."
