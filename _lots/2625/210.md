TYPESET: "Illustrated map that appeared in issue #07/2019 of the Berlin letterpress magazine <i>P98a PAPER</i> published by Erik Spiekermann (Berlin, 2019) and reprinted as the November 2020 calendar page in </i>The American Bystander.</i>  Watercolor, pen and ink. 270x425 mm; 10½x16¾ image, on 15x21-inch sheet. Signed \"Maira Kalman & Rick Meyerowitz\" in pencil, by each, lower right margin.  <br><br>Provenance: Property of the artists. <br><br>The map was created over a weekend (January 12-14, 2018) by Maira Kalman and Rick Meyerowitz in response to Donald Trump publicly calling certain countries “Shitholes.” In the artists' words: \"We knew right away we had to respond, and the logical thing for us was to make a map. We spent a day ping-ponging country names off each other, and sketching maps. It would be Trump’s map, drawn by him, not us, and he’d think everyplace in the world he didn’t own is a Shithole. The sketches and the names were so much fun you could hardly call it work, and the final map is one of the best things we’ve done together.\""
