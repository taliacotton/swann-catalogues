TYPESET: "<p>Bouisset's poster of a young girl (his daughter Yvonne) writing on a
  wall to advertise Chocolat Menier launched him to instant fame within the poster
  world. Becoming a specialist in using children in his posters, it wasn't long before
  he called on his son Jacques to pose for various images. Young Jacques appears in
  many seminal poster images, including LU (Biscuits Lefevre Utile), Poulain and this
  rather surprising image for rolling papers. </p><p>While child labor was certainly
  a part of French society at the end of the 19th century, it wasn't often paraded
  in front of the public. So why enlist this young chimney sweep into advertising?
  For a possible answer we turn to the advertising genius of the parent company, Job,
  and its owner Jean Bardou. They had already employed the ultimate talents in the
  poster world to design their advertising (Jules Chéret, Alphonse Mucha, Pal and
  others) and Bardou realized that Bouisset's style had become a popular trend. He
  was obviously correct, as this charming poster was very successful.</p>"
