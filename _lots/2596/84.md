TYPESET: "Bragdon, like many of the early Art Nouveau artists, was trained as an architect, but worked in all the fields of decorative arts. In all, he designed three posters for the <i>Chap Book</i> magazine, this being the last. Whereas Bragdon's first two posters are very turn-of-the century in style, this one clearly heralds a new era in design, presaging Art Deco by almost 30 years. Although copies of this poster can be found in the Library of Congress and the University of Rochester library, it scarcely appears at auction. <i>Rare</i>. DFP-I 184, Reims 1152, Bragdon fig. 29, Margolin p. 112, not in Kiehl."
