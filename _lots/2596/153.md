year: 1967
at-a-glance: 20½x14 inches, 52x35½ cm. Tea Lautrec, San Francisco.
TYPESET: This 1st printing was produced before the concert on two different kinds
  of paper - one, a thick poster board and the other, a thin regular stock version.
  In the summer of 1967, Bill Graham took two of his San Francisco favorites to Canada
  - The Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. The series of shows took place at Toronto's
  O'Keefe Centre. There are hard-to-verify stories that the original cache of posters
  was confiscated at the Canadian border by border patrol, but we don't know for sure
  if the posters were seized or simply stowed away by Canadian fans. Perhaps because
  of this, BG-074 is among the <i>rarest</i> of concert posters.
FOOTNOTE: 'Condition B-: extensive creases and abrasions along sharp vertical and
  horizontal folds; abrasions and staining in margins and image; verso made into a
  tape and marker sign reading "Students to I-75 Lexington KY." Printed on thick paper.'
