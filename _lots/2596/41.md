TYPESET: <p>Mucha's irresistible allegories of flowers are among the most delicate
  of the decorative panels Mucha designed. His printer, Champenois, continuously pushed
  him to design more panels to satisfy the public's seemingly insatiable demand. In
  all, Mucha designed approximately 18 different sets of decorative panels. These
  are in many ways his most sensual images, playing a flirtatious graphic game between
  the women and the flowers that surround them. Mucha's paintings of both <em>Iris</em>
  and <em>Carnation</em> were exhibited in his one-man show at the <em>Salon des Cent</em>
  in 1897. The aquarelles bore the notice "to be published by Champenois." Over the
  course of the next few months, Mucha completed the other two flowers. </p><p>The
  set in this format, printed in a run of 1000, sold out so quickly that Champenois
  printed the series again in a smaller format with all four images on a single sheet.
  "One of the fundamental premises of art nouveau was to look for inspiration in nature,
  and in <em>The Flowers</em> set Mucha produced one of the best arguments for it
  . . . it is a clear case of Beauty celebrating beauty in each instance. By using
  soft pastels and harmonious composition, Mucha imbued each scene with a sense of
  tranquility and quiet enjoyment" (Lendl p. 122). </p><p>Rennert / Weill, 49, Lendl
