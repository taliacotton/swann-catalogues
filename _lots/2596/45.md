TYPESET: "For Mucha's third and final allegorical group of <i>The Seasons</i>, the premise remains the same - young women as irresistible representations of the seasons. Here, Mucha's approach is slightly different from the preceding versions; he has placed these women within decorative borders and employs a starker and more realistic color scheme than the pastels of 1896.
