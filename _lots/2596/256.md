TYPESET: "Andersen was one of the most prolific Danish poster designers between the wars. He was well known as an illustrator, both for newspapers and books. For this International Aircraft Meeting, he produced a sophisticated graphic of three planes circling a globe upon which is a Danish flag, planted at the top. The way he plays with the shadows and evokes the site of the event using only the Danish flag, on a globe that is otherwise unmarked, underscores his exquisite graphic design capabilities. This is the Danish version. Danish Posters 8."
