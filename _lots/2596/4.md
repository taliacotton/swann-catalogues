TYPESET: <p>Bonnard designed only six posters. His first, <em>France Champagne</em>
  in 1891, was a revolutionary image, displaying the influence of the Ukiyo-e Japanese
  prints and opening up horizons for the new generation of poster artists. "The central
  element of this highly modern composition, in which the large area of blank paper
  creates a vacuum, is the woman who is depicted only in outline - with details provided
  only at the top of her dress and the rendering of her head . . . The monogram, in
  the form of a butterfly, pays tribute to Japanese art and balances the composition"
  (Salon des Cent p. 35). Her attention (and that of the viewer) is drawn to the charming
  little dog. </p><p>Wember 137, DFP-II 79, Salon des Cent 5, Bouvet 39, Art Nouveau
