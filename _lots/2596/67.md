at-a-glance: "63x46¾ inches, 160x118¾ cm."
TYPESET: "With this heartfelt and tender image of a family evicted onto the street to advertise the advent of a tenants' association, \"Steinlen's posters began promoting social causes rather than commercial products\" (Cate and Gill p. 51). A transition between his advertising work and later war images, we can still see several familiar themes, such as the cat and the children, which make this image \"among his most appealing works . . . Steinlen at his humanistic best\" (Wine Spectator). Whereas Steinlen's images from 1917-18 are almost all black and white, here we still experience some of his vibrant colors. Bargiel 52, Wine Spectator 113."
