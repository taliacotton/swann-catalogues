TYPESET: "Sun Valley's year-round, outdoor ice skating rink, right behind the resort's eponymous lodge, has long been the home for celebrities, famous skaters, a skating school and the resort's famous ice show. If the image of an ice skating polar bear seems a little incongruous, it shouldn't. Herman Maricich, an early proponent and impresario of ice skating in Sun Valley, who ran the rink from the mid 1950s, was renowned for, among many other things, a routine for the weekly ice shows done in a polar bear costume."
