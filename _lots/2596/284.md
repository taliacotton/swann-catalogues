TYPESET: "Launched in 1953, the <i>Andrea Doria</i> was one of the most elegant liners of her era. She is pictured here with her sister ship <i>Cristoforo Colombo</i>, against a collage of nautical flags. She was designed with an eye towards modernity and luxury rather than speed, and was filled with original artwork that added to her sophistication. Eclipsing her style and grace was the tragedy that brought her short career to an end. In 1956, off the shore of Nantucket, the <i>Andrea Doria</i> was hit by the <i>Stockholm</i> and sank soon thereafter. Ciuti was an architect and industrial designer, often cited along with Marcello Nizzoli and Bruno Munari as one of the top Italian designers of the 1930s and 40s."
