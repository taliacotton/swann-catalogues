TYPESET: "Throughout his career, Berthon designed more decorative panels than posters. He would draw them onto the lithographic stones himself in order to ensure the most sophisticated, pastel effects. <i>Les Eglantines</i> is one image in a series devoted to flowers that was printed by Chaix. As with all of Berthon's work, it is a warm-toned pastel image, with a delicate Symbolist atmosphere. A theme of sensuousness runs through many of his works and is exhibited here in the way the woman is holding the branch. Arwas p. 106, Gold p. 136."
