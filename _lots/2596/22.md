TYPESET: <p>Ibels was one of the most prominent young artists in Paris in the 1890s.
  He studied at the <em>Academie Julian</em> with Pierre Bonnard and Edouard Vuillard
  and became one of the founding members of the <em>Nabis</em>, participating in all
  of their exhibitions. In 1891, his works were exhibited side-by-side with Toulouse-Lautrec's
  at the <em>Salon des Independants</em>, and the two became close friends. Like Toulouse-Lautrec,
  he loved the café-concerts and designed most of his posters for, or featuring performers.
  </p><p>In 1893, he collaborated with Toulouse-Lautrec on an album of lithographs
  entitled <em>Le Café-Concert</em>. Rather than become a painter, Ibels dedicated
  his art to the printed page, working for magazines, designing sheet music covers
  and theatrical programs. Within the <em>Nabis</em>, he was known as "The Nabis Journalist,"
  because of his work for many of Paris' progressive journals and the founding of
  the short-lived periodical <em>L'Escarmouche</em>. </p><p>DFP-II 471, Wine Spectator
