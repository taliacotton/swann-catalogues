TYPESET: <p>Sarah Bernhardt made her first American tour in 1896, by which point she
  was already an international star, taking with her a variation of one of the posters
  Mucha had designed for her in Paris. "As was the case with all these versions, it
  mentioned no name of the play, nor did it mention that the plays for which the design
  was originally used were presented on this tour" (Rennert / Weill p. 108). Among
  Mucha's famous posters for the actress that were reused to promote her American
  appearances were <em>Gismonda, Lorenzaccio, Tosca</em> and this, <em>La Dame aux
  Camelias</em>.</p><p>This tour, beginning in 1914, was in many ways the actress'
  final act; she was already in her late 60s, World War I had broken out, and in 1916
  she had her leg amputated below the knee. With these factors combined with a lack
  of contemporary media coverage, it is uncertain how much, if any, of this tour actually
  took place, possibly accounting for the scarcity of the image. Note how it is referred
  to as a "World's Tour" and not an American Tour. Aside from the entirely different
  titles and text, the most obvious diversion from Mucha's original is the bright
  colors used here, compared with the subtle pastels from 1896. <em>Rare</em>. <em>We
  have found no other copies at auction.</em></p>
