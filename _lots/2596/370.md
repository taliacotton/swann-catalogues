  been published in America in the 1911 edition of <i>Industrial Worker</i> (The International
  Publishing Co., Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.), a newspaper of the Industrial Workers of
  the World. It then was issued as a poster in 1911 by the Cleveland firm of "Nedeljkovich,
  Brashich, & Kuharich" (See Swann sale 2284 lot 368). This 1912 printing issued by
