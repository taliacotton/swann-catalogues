TYPESET: "Looking at these seagulls flying over a barren landscape, one could easily think that it is a tourism poster for Terranova. However, this is not the case. Hohlwein designed another poster with this title that bears additional text identifying Terranova as a brand of industrial plaster. While this image remains somewhat of a mystery, it is presumably touting the lightweight and white color of the material. We must assume that at the time, Terranova was sufficiently known that potential clients needed only to see its name in advertising for this poster to be effective. DFP-III 1358, Frenzel 28, Hohlwein-Stuttgart 17."
