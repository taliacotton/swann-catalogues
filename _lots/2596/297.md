TYPESET: "The LZ 129, the <i>Hindenburg</i>, recognizable by it's small gondola, en route over the Atlantic Ocean, is cleverly juxtaposed with an old clipper ship on the sea below to emphasize the speed of the new airship. The <i>Hindenburg</i> made 17 transatlantic flights in 1936, its only full year of operation. The trip toward Europe could be made in as quickly as two days. The Westward journey took a bit longer, lasting up to three days. It was on her first North American crossing in 1937 that the airship tragically burst into flames while attempting to dock in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This is the German version. Airlines p. 37, Crouse p. 27."
