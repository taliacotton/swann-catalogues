DESCRIPT: THÉOPHILE-ALEXANDRE STEINLEN (1859-1923)
CROSSHEAD: LAIT PUR STÉRILISÉ DE LA VINGEANNE. 1894.
year: 1894
at-a-glance: 54½x39 inches, 138½x99 cm. Charles Verneau, Paris.
TYPESET: <p><em>Lait Pur Stérilisé</em> is the first poster Charles Verneau printed
  for Steinlen. It was only the second poster in Steinlen's "mature style" (Arwas,
  p. 54). The artist and the printer formed a lasting relationship and went on to
  produce some of the era's most memorable posters. This poster instantly became a
  success and remains an iconic image of the period. It is almost deceptively simple,
  featuring the artist's daughter, Colette, sitting at a table sipping from a bowl
  of milk, with three cats at her feet hoping for a single spilled drop. It is a delicate
  image, beautifully drawn on stone with a "flowing curvilinearity" (Cates &amp; Gill
  p. 122). Steinlen used green for the outline, as opposed to black, which adds to
  the soft feel of the image. </p><p>Crauzat p. 134, Reims 1030, Bargiel / Zagrodzki
