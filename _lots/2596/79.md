TYPESET: '<p>Bradley''s first poster ever, and first of many <em>Chap Book</em> posters
  (Koch p. 36), from August 1894. Although justifiable comparisons to Beardsley have
  been made, Charles Hiatt (author of Picture Posters, 1895, and prominent critic
  and early authority on posters) stated it best: "He has seen and assimilated, in
  no small degree, the manner of Mr. Aubrey Beardsley. He is however, a great deal
  more than a mere imitator; what he has borrowed, he has borrowed with conspicuous
  intelligence, and nobody could for a moment accuse him of anything approaching petty
  larceny" (Picture Posters p. 298). </p><p>Kiehl p. 16, DFP-I 152, Koch p. 22, Reims
