TYPESET: "Lautrec's series <i>Elles</i> is one of the high-points of nineteenth-century art\" (Adriani p. 222). The series depicts the prostitutes of Montmartre in a humble, intimate manner that did not flaunt their sexuality, but instead focused on the banal routines of their daily lives. 100 of these portfolios were printed. The cover and frontispiece of the folio bore this illustration, and when the 10 sheets were put on exhibition in the offices of <i>La Plume</i> magazine in 1896, this image, with the addition of the text (not by Lautrec's design), was re-used as a poster. Adriani 171-IV, Delteil 179, Adhemar 200, DFP-II 842, Wember 767, Devynck p. 89, Gold 85 (var), Salon des Cent p. 83."
