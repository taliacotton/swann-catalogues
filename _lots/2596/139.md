TYPESET: A dazzling design for a music hall performance, in which a showgirl uses
  a record to cover her modesty. It is an unexpected change from the usual boa or
  fan used by burlesque performers, but it aludes to the fact that the performance
  includes "speaking." One should translate the rest of the poster on one's own. This
  is the smaller format.
FOOTNOTE: 'Condition A: minor pin holes in corners. Framed.'
