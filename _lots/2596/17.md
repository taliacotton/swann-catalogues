TYPESET: "La Cigale opened in the heart of Montmartre in 1887, and became even more successful after it was expanded in 1894, making it one of the largest of the Parisian music halls. It also made use of the best poster designers to promote its shows, and Grün was employed exclusively between 1898 and 1902. As the scope of this show was larger than the usual cabarets for which Grün worked, the artist had to adapt his style. Rather than focusing on one voluptuous, sexy character, Grün depicts the entire cast of this large production, prominently featuring Jeanne Bloch in the center. The poster also employs more colors than Grün's usual combination of red and black. Grun p. 47, Spectacle 967."
