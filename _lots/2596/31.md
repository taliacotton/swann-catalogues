TYPESET: "As a student under the inimitable Hohenstein at the Ricordi Studios, Metlicovitz quickly became a master of graphic design in his own right. He was one of the most versatile poster artists who could, and would, constantly change his style from tender Art Nouveau imagery to statuesque allegory. For this image he has adapted yet another style, illustrating a peasant woman in flat colors, hard at work cleaning her whites using Sunlight Soap. The simple image, with broad lettering, also contains a detailed view of the product packaging. Ricordi 170."
