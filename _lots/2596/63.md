TYPESET: "Roubille was an illustrator for many of Paris' turn-of-the-century magazines and a key member of the <i>Salon des Humoristes</i>. His unique and instantly recognizable style is characterized by bright, flat colors, sharp outlining and a great sense of caricature. He only designed a few posters, which is unfortunate, as his style lends itself marvelously to their large format. As a prominent member of the <i>Salon des Humoristes</i> it is not surprising that Roubille was ultimately asked to design a poster for one of their exhibitions. In a Cappiello-like image, Roubille depicts a joyful woman, literally \"grabbing the bull by the horns\" (or at least the pen-holding polar bear by the teeth!). This is the version before lettering."
FOOTNOTE: "Condition B+: repaired tears at edges, one into upper image; creases in margins; bleach spots in image."
