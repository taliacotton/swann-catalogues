Along with James Northfield and Percy Trompf, Sellheim is considered to be one of the finest artists to design travel posters in Australia in the 1930s. He brings to his work an element of the European avant-garde, and his posters are \"distinguished by their innovative design, in particular the use of montage\" (Trading Places 29). He is most famous for designing the flying kangaroo logo for Qantas airlines. Poster Art in Australia p. 42."
