TYPESET: "In 1903, Bonnard designed two posters for <i>Le Figaro</i>. This, the smaller of the two, has the appearance of a stock poster. Using only two colors, Bonnard has created a frame upon which rests an exquisite drawing of a couple sitting down to read the newspaper. Since the typography does not appear to be designed by Bonnard, it would follow that the poster was meant to be reused for different issues of the newspaper, carrying different stories. However, as copies of the poster with different text have not appeared, it likely was not used in this manner. The other poster Bonnard designed in the same year was much larger and was intended to advertise the availability of the paper in general, not a specific story. Fit to Print 19, DFP-II 81, Bouvet 70."
