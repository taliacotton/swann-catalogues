DESCRIPT: JULES CHÉRET (1836-1932)
CROSSHEAD: THÉÂTRE DE LA TOUR EIFFEL / PARIS - CHICAGO. 1893.
year: 1893
at-a-glance: 47½x34½ inches, 120½x87½ cm. Chaix Paris.
TYPESET: "<p>The Eiffel Tower was constructed as part of the 1889 Paris World's Fair.
  During the fair there was a restaurant, Flamand, on the first level. The tower was
  supposed to be torn down once the fair ended; fortuitously that decision was never
  executed, and only the restaurant was closed. In its place Charles Bodinière and
  the writer Alphonse Frank opened up a 400-seat theater. The theater ran from May
  to October every year, and eventually closed in 1900. On May 16th, 1893, the Théatre
  de la Tour Eiffel made an attempt to bring some of Montmartre's spirit to the bourgeois
  Right Bank, with the opening of Paris / Chicago. The show, written by Frank and
  Gaston Arman de Caillavet was a tremendous success. </p><p>Using a bold diagonal
  to create a descending movement, Chéret depicts his main characters in detail, and
  other characters in the background less so. The entire image is given a joyful,
  weightless feeling, as all of the characters (and even some of the typography) appear
  to be floating through the air. When it was printed, this poster was extremely popular
  with collectors, and it was offered to the market in three variations: with only
  the black outline, before the lettering, or like this, in its final iteration. </p><p>Cheret
