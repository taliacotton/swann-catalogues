TYPESET: <p>This, "one of Mucha's most moving posters . . . was a plea for help for
  starving Russian children during the war between the Bolsheviks and the White Russians.
  Between 1918 and 1922, the economic situation in Russia became desperate, and western
  countries including the United States sent shipments of food and grain. The Russian
  government had to allow partial restoration of previously nationalized private land
  so that the land could be more efficiently cultivated. The title of the poster consists
  of only two words in Latin ['Restore Russia'], which can be understood by the speakers
  of many languages. It means Russia must be restored to conditions suitable for human
  life. </p><p>Mucha elevated the sorrowful woman holding an exhausted child beyond
  the meaning of Mother Russia with her gaunt ward by placing circular forms behind
  their heads, invoking the halos of the Madonna with the Christ child. Two wounded
  doves in the upper corners signify a Slavic nation that would die without aid, and
  the hearts in the lower corners express hope in human compassion" (Spirit of Art
  Nouveau p. 181).</p><p> Lendl p. 288, Brno 69, Grand Palais A76, 150th Mucha 267
