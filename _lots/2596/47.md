DESCRIPT: D'APRÈS ALPHONSE MUCHA (1860-1939)
CROSSHEAD: SARAH - BERNHARDT. Circa 1914.
year: 1914
at-a-glance: 82x40½ inches, 208¼x102¾ cm. Carey Print, New York.
TYPESET: <p>Adapted from Mucha's 1898 design for the cover of <em>L'Estampe Moderne</em>,
  Sarah Bernhardt also used a smaller and less colorful version of this image to promote
  her first of three American tours starting in 1905 (see Swann<a href="https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/Lots/auction-lot/DAPR-S-ALPHONSE-MUCHA--1860-1939--SARAH---BERNHARDT--FAREWEL?saleno=2421&amp;lotNo=43&amp;refNo=717341"
  title=""> Sale 2421 Lot 43</a>). The absence of Mucha's signature suggests that
  the image was merely inspired by Mucha, but not created by his hand. The visual
  link here to psychedelic posters from the 1960s is as palpable as any we have ever
  seen; one can even see Milton Glaser's inspiration for his Bob Dylan poster in the
  way this unknown artist depicts the outlined flowers behind this maiden's ear. <em>Rare</em>.</p>
FOOTNOTE: 'Condition B+: expertly-repaired tears, creases and minor overpainting in
  margins and image. Two-sheets.'
