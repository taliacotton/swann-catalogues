DESCRIPT: HENRI DE TOULOUSE-LAUTREC (1864-1901)
CROSSHEAD: DIVAN JAPONAIS. 1893.
year: 1893
at-a-glance: 31½x23¼ inches, 80x60¼ cm. Edw. Ancourt, Paris.
TYPESET: "<p>The Divan Japonais was a small café-concert at 75 Rue des Martyrs, where
  Yvette Guilbert performed after becoming popular through her act at the Moulin Rouge.
  This is Toulouse-Lautrec's only poster to show both Jane Avril and Yvette Guilbert,
  the two Montmartre demimondes who were both his friends and major inspirations.
  Jane Avril, the star dancer at the Moulin Rouge, is pictured here seated next to
  the literary critic, Édouard Dujardin. Onstage in the background, Guilbert is depicted
  from the neck down, recognizable by her trademark long black gloves. The composition
  is built along the diagonal of the stage and the orchestra in the style of Japanese
  woodblock prints that were so fashionable in Paris at the end of the 19th century.
  Lautrec impishly punctures the diagonal with the priapic scrolls of the instruments.
