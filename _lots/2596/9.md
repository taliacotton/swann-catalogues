TYPESET: "Géraudel was an inventive chemist who made a fortune selling pastilles (cough drops) and this cure-all purgative. The key to his success was his sense of advertising. He took advantage of the new medium of posters and regularly availed himself of the medium's earliest acclaimed master; Chéret excelled at this elongated format that allowed him to create larger-than-life \"Chérettes.\" Later that year, Chéret reconfigured the poster for a smaller, one-sheet version. Broido 894, DFP-II 221, Cheret 1170, Health 273, Maindron 743."
