TYPESET: "Marcelle Lender (1862-1926) starred in many of the operettas and comic operas popular at the end of the 19th century. One of her shows, <i>Chilperic</i>, was justifiably unmemorable except that it inspired Lautrec to paint a magnificent painting and design six lithographs (Adriani 110-115). This is by far the best image from that series and the only one that is in color. Lautrec depicts her bowing after an extravagant Spanish dance that fascinated him. To render her wild attire and hairdo, he used eight colors with chalk, ink with brush and a spraying/splatter technique. As Adriani notes, \"no other lithograph is printed with such wealth of subtle color combinations and none embodies, as this does, the opulent decoration of an age moving towards its close.\" This is the fourth state of four, from the edition of 1211 impressions printed for the Berlin magazine <i>Pan</i>, which were inserted in volume I, no. 3 of the periodical. Delteil 102 III, Wittrock 99 IV, Adriani 115 4B, Schardt p. 179."
