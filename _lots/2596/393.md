TYPESET: "Rather inexplicably, this poster for Italy's premiere auto-maker, was printed in Great Britain and designed by a virtually unknown artist. The image was so popular however, that it was used on the cover of a 1984 publication on the company's history. The poster combines the grace and elegance of ancient Rome with the modern splendor and power of the automobile. The image appears with several variations of overtext. Khachadourian p. 146."
