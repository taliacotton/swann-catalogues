  through 1951. Built by the Goodyear -Zeppelin Company, it was the first streamlined

  New Haven fleet followed on the heels of the incredibly popular Zephyr (Chicago,
  Burlington &amp; Quincy Line) and the Union Pacific's M-10000. This exceptional
  Modernist poster has been misattributed to Sascha Maurer, but clearly bears the
  signature of a different, unknown artist. <em>Rare</em>.</p>"
