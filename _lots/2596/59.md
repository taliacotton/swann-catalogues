TYPESET: '<p><em>L''Estampe Moderne</em> was published between May 1897 and April
  1899. As with <em>Les Maitres de l''Affiche</em>, every month, four prints were
  issued to subscribers, delivered in a portfolio sleeve designed by Mucha. In all,
  there were 100 images. However, as the name implies, these were not posters but
  prints, designed by many of the popular artists of the day. The technical and editorial
  team responsible for publishing the works was among the best of its day: the printer
  was Champenois, and the directors were Charles Piazza (who published Mucha''s <em>Ilsée</em>
  and <em>Le Pater</em>), and Charles Masson, the director of the Musée du Luxembourg.
  </p><p>The print run was limited to 2000 copies, with an additional 100 printed
  on Japan paper. Although all of the prints were designed especially for this portfolio,
  different printing techniques were used, as some are lithographs and some are collotypes.
  Charpentier, whose monogram appears on the cover of this portfolio, was a lesser-known
  but prolific Art Nouveau artist. He was a founding member of "L''Art dans Tout,"
  and was adept at woodworking, medal-design, terracotta, and furniture design. One
  of his lithographic designs is featured as a plate in <em>Les Maitres de L''Affiche</em>,
  and he was the creator of the blind stamp on each plate of the 1893-5 <em>L''Estampe
  Originale</em> portfolio (Lugt 819).</p>'
FOOTNOTE: 'Condition generally A- / B+: minor foxing and staining in some plates;
  pencil notations on the verso of each; in original folio, including itemized list
  and paste-in. With one fascicle.'
