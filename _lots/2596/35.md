TYPESET: Art Nouveau artists loved peacocks, with their extravagant multi-colored
  feathers. Müller, who designed a handful of similar, horizontal format decorative
  panels, approaches these birds from an unusual perspective; depicted from the ground
  level, their beautiful plumage is seen up-close, as are the plants and vegetation
  that surround them as they strut.
