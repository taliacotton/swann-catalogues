DESCRIPT: ADOLFO DE KAROLIS (1874-1928)
CROSSHEAD: TURIN. 1911.
year: 1911
at-a-glance: 27½x19½ inches, 69¾x49¾ cm. L. Chappuis, Bologne.
TYPESET: <p>Primarily a painter, whose work was influenced by Burke-Jones and the
  pre-Raphaelites, de Karolis is barely known as a poster artist. Here, in his poster
  promoting Turin's 1911 <em>International Exhibition of Industry and Trade</em>,
  he uses a nearly identical image to that employed by Metlicovitz for the same event
  (see <a href="https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/Lots/auction-lot/LEOPOLDO-METLICOVITZ--1868-1944--ESPOSIZIONE-INTERNATIONALE-?saleno=2133&amp;lotNo=100&amp;refNo=598238"
  title="">Swann sale 2133, lot 100</a>). The only difference between the posters
  is that Metlicovitz's allegory was of only two men, while de Karolis depicts three.
