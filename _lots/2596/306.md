In 1891, the Empire State Express made her first trip. On her 50th anniversary in 1941, the New York Central Line inaugurated the \"New\" Empire State Express. According to the hyperbolic commentary written in a booklet released by the railroad for the occasion, this train, \"which is truly magnificent [is] as completely comfortable as modern science can make it.\" The railroad also used this poster image for the cover of a brochure. Zega 154."
