TYPESET: "A painter who emigrated from Germany, Maurer brought the European tradition of Modernist poster design to America. Although best known for his ski posters, Maurer also did a lot of poster work for both the New Haven Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad. For the latter, he designed two posters promoting travel to the New York World's Fair, each with a similar bird's-eye view concept of Manhattan and the famed Trylon and Perisphere. We believe this to be his only image for the New York Central Line, featuring Grand Central Terminal and the New York Central's pride, the 20th Century Limited. <i>Rare</i>. This same image was used as the cover lot for Swann's inaugural Rare and Important Travel Poster auction in 1999. It has only come up for sale once at auction since."
