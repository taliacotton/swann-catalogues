TYPESET: <p>Annand worked as a "freelance commercial artist for much of his long career,
  [he] created pictorial maps, designed dust jackets, illustrated books and magazines,
  and turned out advertisements. Through much of his work Annand showed a genuine
  interest in cartography . . . [and the maps he designed] were among the most refined
  and dignified examples of the genre, well designed and boldly colored" (Picturing
  America pp 34-38). "This pocket-sized, foldout map produced for the Waldorf-Astoria
  Hotel shows principle sights, shopping districts, churches, and clubs. Annand liked
  to use orange as the base color in his maps, an unusual though striking choice"
