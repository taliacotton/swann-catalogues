TYPESET: '<p>Bradley''s style is sometimes referred to as American Art Nouveau, a
  combination of Aubrey Beardsley and the work of the Arts and Crafts movement; Bradley
  "transformed their styles into exceptionally bold and successful designs" (Word
  and Image p. 20). "Because of his early training as a printer, Bradley''s posters
  are distinguished by their good taste in typography which is an integral part of
  the design" (Margolin p. 27). As with so many posters in America at the height of
  the poster craze in the mid 1890s, this one was given an affectionate name: <em>In
  Purple and White.</em> Larger than most of Bradley''s other posters, it is "his
  simplest, boldest, and therefore most modern creation" (Koch p. 99). And yet, despite
  the absence of the intricate detail that defined so much of Bradley''s work, his
  style still carefully reflects the product advertised. "Here, spokes might have
  marred the composition of the poster and their absence gives a feeling of lightness
  and airiness to the bicycle and the entire design" (Bicycle p. 9). </p><p>Kiehl
