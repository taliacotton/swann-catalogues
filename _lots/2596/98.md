TYPESET: Edward Penfield is universally considered to be the first major homegrown
  American poster artist. As Art Director for <i>Harper's</i> (from 1891-1900), it
  was his idea to issue monthly, small-format posters promoting the publication. The
  posters were so popular that many other "little magazines" followed suit. Large
  posters are quite rare amongst Penfield's work (and among Turn-of-the-Century American
  posters in general). Like his large-scale poster for <i> Orient Cycles</i>, this
  print also leaves a blank template at the bottom for additional printed information
  to be added. Kiehl 225, Bicycle Posters p. 69, Weill 116, Timeless Images 96.
