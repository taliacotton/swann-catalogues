TYPESET: 'The production of <i>Medee</i> advertised here was a contemporary adaptation
  of a play originally written by Euripides. A classic, violent Greek tragedy about
  the warrior Jason, the play begins when he returns home from his quest for the Golden
  Fleece, bringing with him Medea. When he falls in love with another woman, Medea,
  "driven by a pagan code of honor and her own dark passions . . . conceives a terrible
  vengeance of gothic cruelty: she kills Jason''s father, her own two children, and
  his new mistress, so that he would have to go through life deprived of everything
  he loved" (Rennert / Weill p. 208). The somber and tragic image depicts a glimpse
  of the slaughter, with Medea, a mad look in her eyes, standing with a bloody dagger
  over one of her victims. "Mucha''s exquisite design uses Medea''s arm and the dagger
  as a giant exclamation point, emphasized by the look of stark horror on her face
  as she exacts her gothic revenge. It is one of [Mucha''s] most powerful posters"
  (Lendl p. 53). "It carries all the signs of Mucha''s masterpieces in composition
  and color as well as the decorative certainty with which he left the bottom two-thirds
  of the background white" (Spirit of Art Nouveau p. 151). The composition is organized
  vertically with Mucha''s trademark "halo" behind the actress'' head, and lettering
  designed in the style of mosaic to evoke the story''s origin in ancient Greece.
  Sarah Bernhardt was so enamored with the snake bracelet that Mucha depicted adorning
  her arm that she actually had one made by Fouquet for her to wear. Rennert / Weill
