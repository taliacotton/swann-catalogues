at-a-glance: 31x23½ inches, 78¾x59¾ cm. Chaix, Paris.
TYPESET: <p>In many ways, both Lautrec and Bruant owed their success in part to each
  other. In 1892, Lautrec designed Ambassadeurs, one of the most enduring images of
  the performer, which captures his famed arrogance. The cabaret star loved the image,
  and Bruant in turn became one of Lautrec's best clients, commissioning three additional
  posters from him. This poster shows the combined insolence of Bruant and Lautrec.
  The performer, dressed in his trademark black velvet suit, hat and boots, doesn't
  even deign to face the public and his viewers. Through Lautrec's genius, the performer
  still remains immediately recognizable. "This poster was printed with three different
  texts, and also used on the cover of Le <em>Mirliton</em> . . . [this variation
  advertises] Bruant's second volume of songs and monologues . . . Interestingly Bruant
  chose Steinlen to illustrate both books but still turned to Lautrec for the poster
  to advertise it, astutely sensing the difference between Steinlen's more narrative,
  illustrative style and Lautrec's bold graphic language" (Montmartre p. 93). </p><p>This
  is a variant of the Fourth State, with the addition of red tint in cuffs and collar.
  This state includes the olive green lettering, not designed by Lautrec. Adriani
