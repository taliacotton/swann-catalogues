TYPESET: "At the turn of the century, the department store E. & A. Mele & Cie commissioned numerous artists to create luxurious advertisements such as this promoting the civility, gentility and aquirability of their products to the well-to-do of Naples. Malerba, Dudovich, Cappiello, and Aleardo Villa, are among the best known designers who created advertisements for the company, often using large formats and sumptuous colors to entice the outwardly-focused upper class into their storefronts. Villa's image differs from most of the more commonly-seen Mele posters in its horizontal format, but also in its advertising a \"rich assortment\" of clothes and dresses for children, rather than sophisticated adults. Ricordi p. 7."
