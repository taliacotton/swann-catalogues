TYPESET: "Steinberg worked for <i>The New Yorker</i> for nearly 60 years, during which time he created almost 90 covers and over 1200 drawings for the magazine. The concept and rendering of this image are a perfect demonstration of Steinberg's sense of the absurd, which was an instrumental part of his work. This image is by far his most famous. It originally appeared as a cover of the magazine on March 29, 1976, and became so popular that it was issued in this poster format."
