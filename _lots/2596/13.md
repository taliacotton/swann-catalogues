TYPESET: Dudovich was one of the most prolific and important of the Italian poster
  artists. He designed more than six hundred posters in a career that spanned more
  than half a century. His formative years were spent working under Adolfo Hohenstein
  and Leopoldo Metlicovitz at the G. Ricordi printing company in Milan, where he worked
  exclusively up until the First World War (for a few years, between 1899-1906, he
  left to work with a different printer Chappuis, in Bologne). After the war ended,
  Dudovich became the art director at IGAP, another large printer in Milan. Throughout
  his career, he worked for all of the major Italian companies, but he is best remembered
  for the images he designed for the Italian department stores Mele and À La Rinascente.
  This poster for a liqueur marks Dudovich's triumphant return to Ricordi after his
  six-year stint at Chappuis. It is not only one of his masterpieces, but a masterpiece
  of Italian poster art itself. Using light in a staggeringly effective manner against
  flat tones and half-tones, he depicts a voluptuous woman leaning over to smell the
  aroma emanating from a small glass of liqueur. The manner in which the light diffusing
  from the glass spreads all over the table and onto her body, is handled in an exceptionally
  sensual manner. Her generous décolletage helps turn this simplest of gestures into
  an unforgettable, monumental act. Weill 146, Ricordi Cover & p. 70, Dudovich 170,
