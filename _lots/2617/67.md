After his studies at the University of Padua under Adrian van Spieghel and Fabricius ab Aquapendente he became official physician of his home town of Ulm. His remarkable textbook on surgery, the ‘Armamentarium chirurgicum’ was first published 10 years after his death and passed through many editions and translations all over Europe. This work contains a complete catalogue of surgical instruments, illustrated demonstrations of a variety of operative procedures and 100 case reports. The success of Scultetus’ publication was responsible for an improved standard of the education of the non-academic barber surgeons, who were treating the majority of the population, and was a significant milestone for the development of surgery as an academic speciality.\" (cf.
