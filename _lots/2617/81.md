In it, the author advocates for the expulsion of all Jews from Portugal, casting groundless, wild, and sweeping invectives rooted deeply in antisemitism. Working from an elaborate conspiracy theory that Jews in Portugal were pretending to be Catholic. Next, systematically infiltrate the medical profession, murder \"real\" Catholics, and use the profession to cover up the killings. Costa Mattos proposed that Portuguese Jews could thereby blot out Christianity and with it the monarchies of Portugal and Spain. (cf.
