A convert from Catholicism to Protestantism himself, Donne's maternal grandfather went into exile and his stepfather was jailed, both for failing to take the very same oath. In this light our author throws himself into squaring this particular circle. Employing a variety of rhetorical angles, he argues that the Oath of Allegiance could be understood as more of a political than a religious agreement, allowing for individual religious freedom and not necessarily precluding a belief in Catholicism. The title suggests that English Catholics need not consider the Oath as anything akin to actual martyrdom, unlike Christians persecuted in Ancient Rome.<br><br>STC 7048; Keynes 1; Pforzheimer 298; ESTC S109984.<br><br>From the Ken Rapoport Collection."
