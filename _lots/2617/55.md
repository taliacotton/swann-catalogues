Hayne of South Carolina between January 19th and 27th, 1830. Ostensibly beginning with a spirited discussion of the pros and cons of protectionist tariffs, the speeches delivered in the course of this imbroglio were spontaneously conceived and orated by both. The debate itself was originally inspired by Samuel A. Foot of Connecticut's call for a temporary suspension of land surveying in a move to stop the government selling new plots of land.<br><br>Webster's Second Reply to Hayne, the third work in the present collection, is regarded as the most eloquent speech ever delivered in Congress. In it, he writes: \"It is the People's Constitution, the People's Government; made for the People, made by the People, and answerable to the People,\" (see page 61) a phrase lightly retooled by Lincoln in the Gettysburg Address. Webster ends with this: \"the sentiment, dear to every true American heart [is] --Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!\" (see page 85). His stirring words are the source of North Dakota's state motto.<br><br>Former owner of these pamphlets, Charles Marsh, served as United States Attorney for the District of Vermont from 1797 until 1801, and was nominated to that office by George Washington. He was also a member of Congress from 1815 to 1817, where he served as Vermont's at-large representative in the House. The building that served as his law office in 1797 Woodstock, Vermont still stands today, the oldest detached law office in Vermont."
