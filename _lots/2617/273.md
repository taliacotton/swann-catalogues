TYPESET: "<br><br>London: James Cundee, Albion Press, 1807.<br><br>First edition, quarto, illustrated with hand-colored frontispiece, engraved title page, and ten full-page engraved illustrations, all but the plan of Philadelphia with hand-coloring; untrimmed throughout, half-title before title, and three leaves of publisher's ads bound after the text; all leaves with rough deckle edges on each leaf; finely bound in later half morocco, with gold tooled and lettered spine, gold ruling to leather on boards, and marbled paper-covered boards with matching endleaves, a very nice example, 11 x 8 3/4 in.<br><br>This sumptuous production includes detailed depictions of Philadelphia, Boston, Hell Gate in New York Harbor, the Bank of the United States, Mount Vernon, and the Death of Washington. Although the author did not hold a high opinion of the newly minted country he visited, he was on the ground at a critical time in the nation's history. His text also includes an account of the trade in enslaved humans abducted from Africa. A quick read of his chapter summaries gives a picture of his opinions about American culture. For example, \"Chapter II: Excessive Heat--Bed Bugs & Mosquitoes--Bunker's Hill--the Death of Major Pitcairn--Vaults containing the Remains of the Officers who fell at the Battle of Bunker's Hill.\" He also includes statistical information, descriptions of natural history, and biographical sketches of Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, John Paul Jones, Benedict Arnold, and other heroes of the Revolution. An exhaustive and fascinating work, this cataloguer feels the topic of chapter XXII still resonates, \"Deplorable Effects of the uncontrolled Liberty allowed to Youth in America--Smoking--An Academic Frolic--Slingers--Eleveners--Gouging--Biting--Kicking.\""
