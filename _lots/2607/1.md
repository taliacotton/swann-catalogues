DESCRIPT: Alcott, Louisa May (1832-1888)
CROSSHEAD: Autograph Letter Signed, undated, post-1868.
TYPESET: '<p>Single wove bifolium sheet inscribed over four pages in brown ink to
  a Miss or Mrs. Thurston, written in response to a fan letter praising Little Women,
  with original folds, signs of handling, unfolded dimensions: 8 3/4 x 7 in.<br><br>Miss
  or Mrs. Thurston Dear Madam,<br><br>As I don''t [have] your proper address I must
  be a little formal in the beginning, but I thank you very much for your kind note,
  for these tokens of interest from strangers are among the pleasantest consequences
  of story writing.<br><br>My "Little Women" have much astonished their Momma by making
  many friends for themselves, &amp; she can only account for it by the grain of truth
  that lay at the bottom of the little story.<br><br>The praise &amp; value most you
  have given me, in saying that my effort to do something toward putting simpler &amp;
  healthier food before the little people has been made evident at least, though very
  imperfectly carried out.<br><br>I have such a love and reverence for children that
  it makes me heart-sick to see the trash offered them, when there is so much that
  is true &amp; fresh &amp; helpful in their own innocent hearts &amp; lives, if wiser,
  older heads would only learn how to shadow it forth in [hearty crossed out] plain
  words for their pleasure &amp; instruction. The little people have taught me more
  than I can ever teach them, &amp; my greatest satisfaction is the friendship with
  which they honor me.<br><br>"Jo" is not myself any more than the others are my sisters,
  only suggestions of the four real girls. I consider her a failure, for she was meant
  as a warning, &amp; to my surprise naughty, riotous, peppery Jo turns out to be
  the favorite. I''m afraid it''s a proof of natural depravity in the rising generation.<br><br>
  Very truly yours,<br><br> L.M. Alcott</p>'
