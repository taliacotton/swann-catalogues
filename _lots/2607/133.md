Or, Monthly Museum of Knowledge and Rational Entertainment, numbers III & IV for March and April; two disbound octavo pamphlets formerly bound, with Murray's essay appearing in two parts that begin on page 132 in the March issue, and part two starting on page 223 of the April issue; 8 1/4 x 5 1/8 in.<br><br>Murray's careful consideration of the rights of women, published here under her nom de plume, Constantia, begins with a long poem. Colored by her own experiences, she systematically addresses arguments that posit a woman's inherent inability to engage in higher thinking. Instead, she indicates the inequality in education, and the ban on women's participation as adults in any challenges beyond the home as the determining factors in women's lives. Her work preceded Wollstonecraft's by two years."
