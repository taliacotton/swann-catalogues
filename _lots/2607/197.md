TYPESET: "London: The Hogarth Press; New York: The Fountain Press, 1929.<br><br>Large octavo, first limited edition, signed on half-title by Woolf in violet ink, copy number 158 (for distribution in  America), of a total of 492 copies printed; unopened, one opening with acidic discoloration from a formerly inserted newspaper clipping (no longer present) slight chip to head of spine; bound in publisher's red cloth, 9 1/2 x 5 1/2 in.<br><br>\"Woolf refutes the widely held assumption that women are inferior writers, or inferior subjects, instead locating their silence in their material and social circumstances. Women have been barred from attending school and university, for instance, or excluded by law for inheritance, or expected to marry during which their time is spent housekeeping and childrearing. Woolf imagines what kind of life ‘Judith Shakespeare’ – a brilliant, talented sister of Shakespeare – might have lived, concluding that she, ‘would have been so thwarted and hindered by other people, so tortured and pulled asunder by her own contrary instincts, that she must have lost her health and sanity to a certainty.’\" (https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/a-room-of-ones-own-by-virginia-woolf)"
