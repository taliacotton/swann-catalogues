TYPESET: "Octavo format notebook containing information regarding the building of the home at 30 Stetson Street, Brookline, Massachusetts, beginning with the purchase of the land, and including construction quotes, three autograph letters signed by the Boston architect, Samuel W. Mead [cousin to the author's husband, Charles Henry Mead (1844-1920)], who designed the home; included in Sears Mead's notes are wallpaper and blind samples, notes about home care and approaches to placement of the home on the lot, how to seal wood floors, \"structural facts & hints,\" and philosophy of decor, \"Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful and believe to be beautiful. Simplicity and sustainability\"; all costs are also recorded, and many other details; although a house still stands at this address, according to what this researcher can gather, it was built in 1895, so perhaps the street has been renumbered in the last 112 years."
