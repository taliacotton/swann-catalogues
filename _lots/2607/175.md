  other miscellany papers.<br><br>Stowers was born in Waddington, New York. She was
  an 1892 graduate of City Hospital, a nurse at Blackwell, and Superintendent of Gouveneur
  Hospital from 1895 until 1921. In the early photo of the original Gouverneur Hospital
  buildings its famous horse-drawn ambulance is standing in readiness. In 1902, Dr.
  Emily Dunning Barringer (1876-1961) became the first woman ambulance physician at
  Gouverneur Hospital, which served the lower east side of New York. Circa 1894, when
  Stowers was stationed on the so-called "Welfare Island" i.e., Roosevelt Island,
  in the East River, it housed a notorious complex of workhouses which included a
  large central hospital, as well as an almshouse, a smallpox hospital, and a hospital
  designated for patients deemed "incurable" by the system, which included those suffering
  from mental and physical disabilities. Investigative reporter Nellie Bly infiltrated
  the Women''s Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell Island in 1887, and wrote Ten Days in a
  Madhouse, an exposé on the inhumane conditions she found there.'
