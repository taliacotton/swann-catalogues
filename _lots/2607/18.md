TYPESET: "New York: Two Palms Press for Downtown for Democracy, 2017.<br><br>Archival pigment print on Hahnemüle paper, full margins, signed, dated and numbered 71/100 in pencil, lower right, 18 x 24 in. (sheet).<br><br>According to the artist, “The Battle between Carnival and Lent is a depiction of greed and foolishness, hypocrisy, falseness, idiotic excess and mockery. That is why it seemed a fitting image for these times.  But the image also contains a liveliness and wit that makes it impossible to despair.  The image is a copy of Pieter Breugel's painting of the same name--it shows the contrast of virtue and vice; self-denial versus self-indulgence and the folly of both.”"
