(cf. Herrera, Hayden, Mary Frank, NY, 1990, illus. p. 7.<br><br>\"The 1970s witnessed a surge of women artists gaining recognition within an art world that had become greatly diversified in style, subject, and materials. The art of Mary Frank resists easy categorization and, at first glance, seems outside the mainstream of late twentieth century art. Her choice of hand-built clay as her medium for fine art sculpture and her exploration of the interconnectedness of the natural world and humanity through the imagery of the body set her apart.\" (https://reynoldahouse.emuseum.com/people/496/mary-frank/objects)"
