Sometimes the giantesses are victims, sometimes they are assertive emblems of power, and often they seem content to revel in their own bodies. [...] Nearly all of the Giant Women works feature a collaged photograph of Steckel’s face atop the oversized figures. In this array of visual metaphors for female subjugation to—and occasional triumph over—male domination, Steckel made herself the charismatic protagonist.\" (cf. https://hannahhoffman.la/exhibition/anita-steckel)"
