Emma Willard pioneered \"female education\" with her Troy Female Seminary in the fall of 1821. Even moves like Willard's were couched in the idea that what we now consider a normal college experience was not appropriate or even necessary for young women. In its 1855 report, the Rutgers Female Institute states that the committee reviewing students \"was struck with one peculiarity [...] that natural quickness which characterizes the operations of the female mind [...] was carried into the close and difficult reasoning which they were called upon to employ [while solving mathematical problems in algebra, geometry, & trigonometry] with remarkable effect.\" Also noting that the students, \"demonstrated a truth which had often been called in question, that the female mind is, by nature, perfectly adapted to these severe and logical studies.\"<br><br>Harriet St. John was born and raised in Lambertville, New Jersey. Little is known of her life after her time at school. She married Princeton graduate, doctor, and later Civil War veteran Josiah Simpson (1815-1874) in 1849, together they had five children. She passed away while living in Baltimore, Maryland in 1862."
