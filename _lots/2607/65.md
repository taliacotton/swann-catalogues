The first publication described Dare Fairfax as, \"A tale of considerable power and genuine pathos, very nearly spoiled by the author's craving for intensity of style.\" The latter publication noted, \"The story, which opens very ingeniously, interested us from the very beginning, and the interest did not once flag till we reached the end of the volume. We devoured the book at one sitting; and if the reader is not too old to enjoy a 'love story,' he can easily do the same.\"<br><br>Gott had a sister and brother. None married. Ada and her sister lived together at the Bristol apartments in Baltimore, where their brother Jackson, an accomplished architect, died in 1909. Ada published only this novel and two books of poetry."
