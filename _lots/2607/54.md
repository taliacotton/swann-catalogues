TYPESET: "Handbuilt earthenware sculpture, depicting three small figures in a cave-like enclosure, 8 x 11 x 3 1/2 in.<br><br>\"Frank’s best-known works are the ceramic sculptures that she started making in the early 1970s, despite having had no previous experience in the medium. (She also worked at home and had no kiln, she told me in a recent phone interview, and so had to carry her fragile pieces down the hall of her apartment building, “past the baby carriages and kids on skates, down the elevator and get [them] in the truck” and off to be fired.) In addition to the Everson’s work, there are several other wonderful examples at the Dorsky, including the poignant Arching Woman (ca. 1972), a mere drape of clay that somehow manages to summon Bernini’s Saint Teresa in Ecstasy, and Three Dancers (1981), which finds an ideal midpoint between the serene choreography of Tang Dynasty tomb figures and the muscular figuration of Auguste Rodin.\" (Quoted from Glenn Adamson's From Facts to Wonder: Mary Frank's Enigmatic Figures, https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/mary-frank-enigmatic-sculptural-figures-1234621314/)"
