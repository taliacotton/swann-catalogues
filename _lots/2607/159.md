His late wife, Faith Trumbull Wadsworth (1769-1846), is also remembered in the letter. In closing, Sigourney asks after Elizabeth Mars Johnson Thomson (1807-1864), the African American missionary serving in Liberia who was born in Connecticut and had recently visited the state before returning to her work overseas."
