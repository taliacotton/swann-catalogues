TYPESET: "Oxford, 27 July 1908.<br><br>Octavo-format ruled paper, written over three pages, explaining how the addressee's shelf clock could not have come from her immediate family and reminiscing about family clocks and the period when she lived in Dansville, written on a folded sheet; horizontal folds, with the original envelope, addressed in holograph and additionally signed with initials, 9 1/2 x 8 in.<br><br>Barton writes, in part: \"I am searching for clocks, which were a part of the household in my early days, and in the change and march of time have quite disappeared. Neither of them [...] were shelf clocks, but tall, upright, the one wood, the other brass, of superb English workmanship. These were both in Oxford, the home of my direct branch of Bartons. [...] Some of these descendants, being both wealthy & elegant, may have made the gift, but I have never given away an old time family relic. I regret that I cannot claim some connection with the clock, but I am glad to know that we have met even in the long age days of dear old Dansville. That word is a talisman to all of us who enjoyed its healing life.\""
