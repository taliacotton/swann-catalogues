CROSSHEAD: 'I: Cutting, from the Lumber Camp Series.'
TYPESET: <p>1931.<br><br>Wood engraving on off-white Japanese paper, copy number sixteen
  from the English edition of thirty, signed lower right, numbered and titled lower
  left, matted, the sheet 15 1/2 x 10 in.<br><br>"Cutting is the first in Leighton's
  series of six wood engravings illustrating different aspects of the work involved
  in timber harvesting. The series grew out of her observations at the Canadian International
  Paper Company's lumber camp in the Laurentian Mountains of Quebec, which she visited
  in the winter of 1930-31 during one of a series of lecture tours she undertook in
  America before emigrating there permanently in 1939. Leighton engraved her designs
  on wood blocks from sketches made on site. Notwithstanding the remote setting that
  inspired the series, its theme of bodily toil is consistent with Leighton's many
  prints of English rural life. Her series echoes the concerns of many American artists
  during the 1930s, when the poverty and unemployment of the Great Depression inspired
  glorification of the ordinary worker, as in the prints of James Edward Allen, Gifford
  Beal, and Benton Murdoch Spruance, who, like Leighton, used a serial format to portray
  work in a narrative fashion." (cf. <a href="http://collection.terraamericanart.org/view/objects/asitem/Objects$0040422/1;jsessionid=F37B56C81C47AFFC26A1BE9A529D016A?t:state:flow=e2e00196-f09e-4a17-a14d-45a5c541b185"
