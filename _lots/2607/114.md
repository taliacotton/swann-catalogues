Carey & Hart's souvenir. I will insert the verses with great pleasure, but I fear that the tale, though it also possesses much merit, will not exactly answer the purpose, it being desirable that all the prose communications from American writers should be essentially of an American character. [...] I will return 'The Storm Painter' by the first private opportunity.\" The Storm Painter was published in The Ladies Companion magazine in 1839.<br><br>Leslie was a prolific published author in her own right, contributing fiction and nonfiction for adults and young readers. She is also remembered for her numerous cookbooks, especially Directions for Cookery, which was first published in 1837."
