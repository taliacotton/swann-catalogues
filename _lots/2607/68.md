Spielmann and G.S. Layard, Kate Greenway, London: Adam and Charles Black, 1905, pictured opposite page 62. <br><br>\"Indeed, charm and delicacy rather than strength are characteristic of Kate Greenaway's genius. We see them, for example, in the little 'Swansdown' and companion drawings [...] and in 'Mary had a Little Lamb,' which the artist drew as a Christmas card for professor Ruskin, with their delicate touches of colour and the exquisite pencil outline â€” so unhesitating and firm nevertheless, that, despite their simplicity, they rarely fail to realise the exact degree of beauty or of character intended\"--page 540.<br><br>Greenaway began a correspondence with Oxford Professor and art critic Ruskin in 1880 when he wrote to compliment her on her drawings. The two developed a long and close friendship until Ruskin's criticism of her later work ultimately eroded their relationship."
