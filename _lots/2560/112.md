Described by Ensor in a letter to his close friend Mariette Rousseau, Gypsy was a “minuscule pug that fills the house in the evening with his significant presence.\" A portrait of a small pug-like dog appeared as a patch over the colored pencil drawing <I>The Temptation of Saint Anthony</i>, held by the Art Institute of Chicago.  The same portrait appears in the center of the etching <I>Musiciens fantastiques</i>, 1888 (see Delteil 43)."
