TYPESET: "Lithotint on cream wove Japan paper, 1918.  278x380 mm; 10¾x14¾ inches, full margins.  Edition of approximately 55.  Signed with the artist's cypher in pencil, lower right.  A superb, richly-inked impression of this very scarce print.<br><br>Hassam (1859-1935, see <a href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/Lots/auction-lot/CHILDE-HASSAM-New-York-Bouquet?saleno=2560&lotNo=122&refNo=779824>lot 122</a>) made more than 350 etchings; in comparison his lithographed <I>oeuvre</i> of fewer than 50 subjects was considerably smaller.  The technical complexity of producing lithographs might have been a determining factor in this overall printed output.  He could produce etchings on his own in his studio, with relative ease, minimal materials and greater spontaneity; with lithography he worked with a lithographic printer, using more complicated printing supplies and proofing impressions at a lithography studio in New York.<br><br>Hassam produced all of his 45 lithographs during the years 1917-18, working with the printer George Miller in New York.  Of these, five were lithotints, like the current work, drawn directly on the stone whereas the lithographs were drawn on transfer paper first and thereafter transferred to stone.  Griffith 29."
