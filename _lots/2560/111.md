TYPESET: "Lithograph on red wove paper, 1894-95. 215x325 mm; 8⅝x12⅝ inches, full margins.  With the soft centerfold, as published in <I>L'Ymagier</i>.  A very good impression of this extremely scarce lithograph.   <br><br>This is the only documented print by Rousseau (1844-1910), known as <I>Le Douanier</i>, the self-taught Post-Impressionist artist whose work exerted a profound influence on the subsequent generation of early 20th century <I>avant-garde</i> artists.  <I>The Dream</i> (1910) and <I>The Sleeping Gypsy</i> (1897), two of Rousseau's best-known oil paintings are held at The Museum of Modern Art, New York and show his unique surreal style occupied by his enchantment with the exotic."
