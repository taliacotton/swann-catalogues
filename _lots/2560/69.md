TYPESET: " Color aquatint, 1928. 460x600 mm; 18x23¾ inches, full margins. Signed by Signac and numbered 166/200 in pencil, lower margin. Etched by Jacques Villon. Published by Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris. A very good impression with strong colors. An avid sailor, Signac (1863-1935) started traveling by a small boat he owned in 1892 into the early 1900s to almost all the ports of France, to the Netherlands and around the Mediterranean as far as Constantinople. He made numerous watercolor studies and oils of these ports, notably St. Tropez, where he docked his boat, and La Rochelle, a port in south western France, all in his characteristic pointillist style. His most famous oil of La Rochelle, done in 1921 and similar to this color aquatint, is now in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris. Ginestet/Pouillon 644."
