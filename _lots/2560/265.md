TYPESET: "Color lithograph printed in black and red, 1922. 298x298 mm; 11 3/4x11 3/4 inches (sheet), full margins. Created for the Dada tour of the Netherlands, January 10-February 14, 1923. A very good impression of this important lithograph with strong colors.In 1923, Schwitters (1887-1948) and van Doesburg (1883-1931) embarked on their \"Dada Campaign\", a tour of Holland in order to introduce Dada to fellow artists. This poster promoted their evenings of lectures and performances as a \"Kleine Dada Soirée,\" or Small Dada Evening. Van Doesburg is known for being a founder of De Stijl, a movement that promoted a formal vocabulary defined by straight lines and primary colors to seek order. Schwitters, a Dadaist, believed in creating confusion and destroying concepts of reality. Despite the divergent beliefs (and reactions to Post-World War I Europe), when the artists met in 1921, they became close friends and collaborators often working together to merge fine art and graphic design by developing new forms of typography."
