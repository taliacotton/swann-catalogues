TYPESET: "Pour le Monument a Paul Cézanne.Bronze with dark brown patina. 290x175x80 mm; 11½x7x3½ inches (excluding base). With the artist's initials lower verso. Based on one of the original bronze casts at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and reproduced by Alva Museum Replicas, Inc., New York.Maillol's (1861-1944) massive stone sculpture Monument à Cézanne was installed, between the double ramps that lead to the terrace of the Orangerie in the Jardins des Tuileries, in October 1929, after more than a decade of preparatory work by the artist (it was replaced by a lead version in 1943 and a bronze version was installed in 1964 near the Carrousel in the Jardins des Tuileries; the original stone sculpture is in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris). Maillol made several preparatory sculpture studies, in which he tried out and rejected different reclining poses, that were cast in bronze and on which this current work is based. The project was commissioned in 1912 by Frantz Jourdain, the founder of the Salon d'Automne, and friend of Paul Cézanne (1839-1906, see lots 64-66\n), who had died six years earlier."
