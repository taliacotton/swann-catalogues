TYPESET: "Etching printed in brown, 1881.  182x255 mm; 7⅛x10⅛ inches, full margins.  Signed in pencil, lower left.  A superb, richly-inked impression of this extremely scarce print.<br><br>Bacher (1856-1909), a native of Cleveland, studied in Ohio and later in Munich where he made friends with Frank Duveneck (1848-1919, see <a href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/Lots/auction-lot/FRANK-DUVENECK-The-Bridge-of-Sighs-Venice--First-Plate-?saleno=2560&lotNo=28&refNo=780430>lot 28</a>).  He accompanied Duveneck to Florence in late 1879 and then to Venice in the summer and fall of 1880, during this time they overlapped with Whistler (see <a href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/Lots/auction-lot/JAMES-A-M-WHISTLER-The-Little-Lagoon?saleno=2560&lotNo=26&refNo=779614>lots 26</a> and <a href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/Lots/auction-lot/JAMES-A-M-WHISTLER-The-Fish-Shop-Venice?saleno=2560&lotNo=27&refNo=779473>27</a>).  They left Venice, some 6 months after Whistler did, and spent the winter and spring of 1881 in Florence again, where this etching was conceived.<br><br>Bacher was perhaps the closest and most profoundly influenced of all Whistler's followers during this time.  Whistler and his model/mistress Maud Franklin moved into the Casa Jankovitz on the Riva with Bacher and other \"Duveneck Boys\" during the summer of 1880 and proofed his plates on a press that Bacher had brought with him to Venice."
