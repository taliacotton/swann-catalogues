Very good impressions.<br><br>The son of an architectural engraver, Sulpis (1856-1942) was born in Paris where he attended the prestigious École Estienne.  After exhibiting at the French salons in the 1880s, Sulpis won the Prix de Rome in 1884, allowing him to study in Italy at the Medici Villa in Rome from January 1885 to December 1888.  Sulpis' works, primarily in printmaking, were recognized with several honors and awards during his career as an artist; he was made a knight of the French Légion d'honneur in 1900 and was elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1911.  Though Sulpis' earlier works are academic in style, his validation as an artist by 1900 allowed him to experiment in his compositions and imaginative use of colored inks."
