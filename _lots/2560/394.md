She studied sculpture at Leeds School of Art and the Royal College of Art in London alongside Henry Moore (1898-1986, see <a href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/auction-catalogs/19TH--20TH-CENTURY-ART?saleno=2560&viewby=Lot_asc&filter_value=Henry%20Moore>lots 397-403</a>) and after graduating, studied in Rome.  Hepworth showed with the Seven and Five Society from 1932 until the group’s dissolution in 1935. This London group originally formed with the intention of returning to tradition after World War I though Modernists, like Hepworth, Moore and Ben Nicholson transformed its mission into promoting abstraction.  Hepworth became known for her primitive method of \"Direct Carving,\" resulting in harmonious smooth forms that have an unspoken intimacy with each other and the environment around them. <br><br>By 1947, Hepworth had already gained international recognition as a sculptor when she produced a series of hospital vignettes while her daughter was ill.  During this time, the artist rendered surgeons in operating theaters based on her observations.  She was profoundly impacted by the purposeful choreography of the operating room staff, the same characteristics she sought in her own abstract sculptures.  She found common ground between artists and doctors, as in her words they both have a purpose “to restore and to maintain the beauty and grace of the human mind and body.”"
