A very good impression.<br><br>According to Melot, this print is based on, \"A painting of the same title shown at the Salon of 1840 and purchased by the French government, now in the Musée Central, Metz, and a study identified by Robaut as the landscape drawing of <I>Volterra, Group of Trees Above Rocks</i>, from around 1834.\"  Corot (1796-1875) executed two <I>cliché-verre</i> versions of this subject.<br><br>A <I>cliché-verre</i>, also known as a glass print, is made by placing photographic paper beneath a glass plate on which a design has been scratched through a coating of an opaque substance and then exposing it to light.  The fluid lines achieved with <I>cliché-verre</i> prints are reminiscent of etched lines as well as ink drawings and paintings.  Delteil 49; Melot 49."
