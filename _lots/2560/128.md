TYPESET: "Lithograph, 1933.  322x260 mm; 12¾x10¼ inches, full margins.  Edition of approximately 100.  Signed, titled, dated and inscribed \"#25\" in pencil, lower margin.  A superb, evenly-printed impression of this scarce lithograph.<br><br>Hartley (1877-1943) was a part of Alfred Stieglitz's circle of American artists who early on began to employ European Modernist styles. In 1909, Stieglitz's 291 Gallery, New York, hosted Hartley's first exhibition of Maine landscape paintings.  Hartley spent 1913, the year of the Armory Show, in Paris where he was exposed to prominent European artists and creative thinkers at Leo and Gertrude Stein's salon.  Hartley's time there and his subsequent 1913-15 travels around Germany deeply influenced his later work.  The 1933 lithograph <I>Waxenstein</i>, part of the Alps bordering Austria and Germany, is reflective of Hartley's exposure to Cézanne (1839-1906, see <a href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/auction-catalogs/19TH--20TH-CENTURY-ART?saleno=2560&viewby=Lot_asc&filter_value=Cezanne>lots 64-66</a>) and Cubism both in New York and in Europe.
