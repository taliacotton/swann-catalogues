TYPESET: "Etching on imitation Japan paper, 1886.  237x178 mm; 9⅝x7⅜ inches, full margins.  First state (of 3).  Signed and dated in pencil, lower right.   A very good impression of this extremely scarce etching.<br><br>The subject of this etching, a group of four physicians examining the stools of the Persian King Darius after the Battle of Arbela, is loosely based on the writings of Plutarch.  Ensor likely chose the very obscure subject as a way to mock ancient history and monarchy.  Delteil 6; Taevernier 6; Elesh 6."
