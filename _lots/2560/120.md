Both very good impressions.<br><br>Eaton (1857-1937) was born in Albany, New York and first started painting at 22 after seeing the work of his friend who had taken up painting as a hobby.  In 1879, he moved to New York where he worked during the day and attended evening classes at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League.  As American painting was shifting from the realistic precedent set by the Hudson River School, Eaton embraced a looser, moodier style that would become Tonalism.  Working mostly in oil and watercolor, he established himself as a working artist by the 1880s and was a founding member of the American Watercolor Society.  Around 1900, he discovered the white pine forests in Connecticut which would become his signature subject matter; in many of his works he placed them against moonlit skies and sunsets cementing his role as a leading American Tonalist."
