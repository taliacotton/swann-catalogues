TYPESET: "Etching on cream laid paper, 1894.  267x420 mm; 10½x16½ inches, full margins.  Third state (of 3). A very good, well-inked impression.<br><br>According to Boyle-Turner, \"This controversial print has been assigned to Seguin, to Gauguin, and even to a collaboration of both artists.\"  The artist Armand Seguin (1869-1903) was a close friend of Gauguin (1848-1903, see <a href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/auction-catalogs/19TH--20TH-CENTURY-ART?saleno=2560&view=&viewby=Lot_asc&filter_value=Gauguin>lots 79-83</a>) during the late 1880s and early 1890s.  Based on the etched inscription upper left, \"Chez Seguin à St. Julien,\" the scene takes place at Seguin's Breton home in Pouldu.  Current scholarship regarding authorship for the print leans toward Gauguin, in its similarities to other of his Breton female portrait compositions.  Kornfeld 25."
