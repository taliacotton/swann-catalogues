A very good impression of this exceedingly scarce woodcut with strong colors.<br><br>Hopkins (1872-1937)  was born in Hudson, Michigan and moved to Chicago after she married at the age of 19.  She did not begin practicing art until 1895 when she enrolled in the Cincinnati Art Academy after the death of her husband.  She studied there for four years before moving to New York to continue her training at the Pratt Institute under Arthur Wesley Dow where she discovered Japanese <I>Ukiyo-e</i> woodcuts.<br><br>She subsequently started making prints, and after she married her second husband, James Hopkins, they traveled around the world on their honeymoon, stopping in Japan to study printmaking.  They lived in Paris for a decade, before returning to the Midwest with the onset of the first world war.  They spent summers at the Provincetown, Massachusetts art colony and she embraced the white line method of woodcuts.  She printed each of her color woodcuts, like many other practitioners of this technique in her day, as unique works of art and not exact facsimile images part of an edition.  The color inks were applied directly to the woodblocks with brushes and dabbing, like painting on a canvas, and each of the impressions retain a unique character as a result.  Vasseur 39."
