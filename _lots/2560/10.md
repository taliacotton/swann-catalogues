Original printed paper wrappers.<br><br>Includes etchings by DORÉ, GÉROME, HADEN, COROT, JONGKIND, MILLET, MANET and others.<br><br>In the 1860s in France, a movement grew to embrace etching, which had fallen out of popularity as lithography, photography and reproductive printmaking had taken precedence.  Lithographs, however, were seen as a mass-produced object, and artists were drawn to etching for its expressive and artistic qualities, which mirrored the drawing process.  Artists such as Édouard Manet (1832-1883, see <a href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/Lots/auction-lot/-DOUARD-MANET-Le-Guitarrero--ou-Le-Chanteur-Espagnol-?saleno=2560&lotNo=34&refNo=777235>lots 34</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t and <a href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/Lots/auction-lot/%C3%89DOUARD-MANET-Chapeau-et-Guitare-Frontispiece?saleno=2560&lotNo=35&refNo=774926>35</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t), Charles Meryon (1821-1868, see <a href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/Lots/auction-lot/CHARLES-MERYON-LArche-du-Pont-Notre-Dame?saleno=2560&lotNo=21&refNo=777352>lot 21</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t) and Félix Bracquemond (1833-1914) created highly detailed compositions, focusing on qualities unique to etching (like the use of burr and selective wiping of the plate) and selecting papers and inks as they saw fit.  In 1862, the Société de Aquafortistes was established, founded by publisher Alfred Cadart (1828-1875) and Auguste Delâtre (1822-1907), which promoted etching to artists and the general public.  Part of that promotion included the publication of deluxe, limited edition portfolios, such as the current work, that highlighted artists working in the medium, in many instances the contributing printmakers were already highly-esteemed painters of the day (such as Millet, Corot and Manet in the current work), which became very popular throughout the decade.  This ushered in what is known as the Etching Revival that lasted well into the early 20th century."
