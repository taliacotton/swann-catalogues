Published by Goupil, Paris. From L'Album de 20 lithographies d'apres les tableaux de Claude Monet. A superb, richly-inked impression of this scarce lithograph, with strong contrasts.Based on Monet's (1840-1926) same-titled painting from 1886, now in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris. The woman in the work was Suzanne Hoschedé (1868-1899), the artist's stepdaughter and favorite model; she was the sister of the artist Blanche Hoschedé (1865-1947, see lot 47\n). Their mother, Alice Hoschedé, married Monet in 1892, after the death of her estranged husband, the art collector and wealthy department store owner, Ernest Hoschedé. Monet represented Suzanne in silhouette standing on an embankment at Giverny, near Monet's home in the country outside Paris."
