As a young man, Gleizes exhibited at the Paris Salon d'Automne and was at the forefront of <I>avant-garde</i> stylistic and political movements as an artist and writer.  n 1911, Gleizes was part of the small Cubist circle whose works scandalized the <I>Salon des Indépendants.</i>  After World War I, Gleizes moved with his wife to New York, where he witnessed the irreverent art of the interwar years and continued to paint in a nonrepresentational style, though Cubism was considered old fashioned.  By further exploring the limits of composition and color theory, Gleizes strengthened the public's interest in nonrepresentative art.  In 1950, Gleizes illustrated Blaise Pascal's <I>Pensees Sur l'Homme et Dieu</i> having renewed interest in spirituality."
