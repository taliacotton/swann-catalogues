Signed in oil, lower right recto.<br><br>Ex-collection private collection, New York.<br><br>Vlaminck (1876-1958) is considered a leader of the Fauve movement.  Born in Paris, he started painting as a teenager and was largely a self-taught artist.  Inspired after seeing Van Gogh's work exhibited in Paris, he began to use bold colors and brushstrokes in his work . In 1905, he exhibited at the <I>Salon d'Automne</i> (alongside Derain and Matisse), the exhibition at which the critic Louis Vauxcelles called the artists wild beasts or <I>fauves</i>, giving the name to the art movement.  He experimented by applying unmixed paint directly from the tube to the canvas and deviating from literal represetation to expressive color.  Later in his career, he used darked tones and figurative realism often depicitng rural landscapes, like the current work."
