While he was a painter working with a Cubist approach during his early career, in 1920 he co-signed the <I>Realistic Manifesto</i>, which rejected Cubism and Futurism and argued that art should be abstract but embrace the reality of space and time (an argument similar to Constructivism).   In 1923 he settled in Paris and started to create sculpture in the manner outlined in the manifesto.  He developed a technique to solder bronze wire together to form plates in order to build rather than cast his sculptures.  The <I>Developable Surface Series</i> is his best known work, which examined volume of form and its relationship with light, movement and spatial perception.  His work pushed sculptors to consider space and form as the material and subject matter of sculpture in its own right."
