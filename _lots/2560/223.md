A superb impression of this very scarce, early print, with well-inked burr in the heavily-shaded areas.<br><br>This is among the earliest of approximately 20 etchings and drypoints Picasso (1881-1973, see <a href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/auction-catalogs/19TH--20TH-CENTURY-ART?saleno=2560&viewby=Lot_asc&filter_value=Pablo%20Picasso>lots 220-248</a>) made between 1908 and 1915, when he and Georges Braque  (1882-1963, see <a href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/auction-catalogs/19TH--20TH-CENTURY-ART?saleno=2560&viewby=Lot_asc&filter_value=Georges%20Braque>lots 266-271, 273-277</a>) were developing Cubism.  Braque visited Picasso's studio in late 1907 and viewed his iconic <I>Demoiselles d'Avignon</i>, now at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, which set off several years of fervent artistic experimentation between the two artists.  By the winter of 1909-10, both Braque and Picasso had nearby studios in Paris and saw each other on a regular basis.  During this time in Montmartre, the artists established the basis for High, or Analytic, Cubism, the most abstract form, among the most significant and extraordinary art movements of the 20th century.
