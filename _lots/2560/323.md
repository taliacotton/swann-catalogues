TYPESET: "Oil on canvas, 1952.  460x556 mm; 18x21¾ inches.  Signed in oil, lower right recto.<br><br>Garbell (1903-1970) was born in Riga, Latvia and started painting at the age of 13.  He first studied art in Moscow and moved to Paris in 1923 where he trained at the Académie Ranson with Roger Bissière.  While affiliated with the School of Paris, he developed an individual style, which combined both Cubist and representational elements.  At the beginning of his career he was drawn toward abstraction, but as his work progressed he became more interested in representational scenes, instead depicting the cliffs and beach at Mers-les-Bains in the North of France."
