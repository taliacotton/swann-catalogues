TYPESET: "<p>Oil on canvas. 702x885 mm; 28x34Â½ inches. Signed in oil, lower right
  recto. 1947.</p><p></p><p>A very similar painting, <em>Perpetual Destroyer</em>,
  (now in the collection of the Henry Art Gallery, University of Washington), was
  among four Ben-Zion works included in a 1946-48 State Department sponsored project
  of cultural diplomacy intended to demonstrate to the world America's artistic coming
  of age.  These paintings are discussed and illustrated in a wonderful book, <em>Art
  Interrupted:  Advancing American Art and the Politics of Cultural Diplomacy</em>,
  (2012) pp. 64-68.  The editors write:  <em>In 'Perpetual Destroyer,' a tank or bulldozer
  like apparatus moves on relentless treads over blood-red and blackened barren earth.
  \ The detritus accumulated on the machine's path of obliteration has been transformed
  into added armaments that facilitate  its ceaseless path of ruination under a brilliant
  blue sky.  The viewer witnesses powers unleashed and seemingly beyond all control</em>.
  \ This description could easily apply to <em>Perfect Leveler</em>.</p>"
year: 1947
