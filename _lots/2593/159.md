TYPESET: "Original watercolor painting on Whatman's Water Color Board. 584x375 mm, 23x14Â¾ inches. 1939. <br><br>Leslie Ragan created two well-known posters for the New York World's Fair, one on behalf of the New York Central System, and the other advertising the \"Railroads on Parade\" spectacle at the fair. Here, Ragan diverges from his railroad theme to create a picturesque and delicately-detailed view of the Trylon and Perisphere, flanked by vignettes of Lower Manhattan in 1789 and 1939. He cleverly breaks through the top border of the painting with the sharp point of the Trylon."
