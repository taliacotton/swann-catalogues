He later won a 3-year scholarship to the Art Students League, New York, where he focused on printmaking. Throughout his career, he mastered a variety of techniques, including etching, woodcut and lithography, such as the current lot. An extremely dynamic artist, Barnet changed his style significantly throughout his career.
