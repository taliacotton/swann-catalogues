Abrams, Inc., New York.  1973.  <br><br>A very good impression of this scarce lithograph. Fath 90.<br><br>Benton was already seen as a leader in the Regionalist movement and a celebrated muralist by the time the WPA started the Federal Arts Program. He had been commissioned to paint murals of life in Indiana for the 1933 Century of Progress Exhibition in Chicago, which caused controversy. In 1934, his work was featured on the cover on <i>Time</i> magazine, which legitimized Regionalism as an art movement. His murals were influential for many of the artists hired as muralists under the WPA."
