  the New Deal, Reginald Marsh was enlisted in the premier art project funded by the
  Treasury Section of Fine Arts, to decorate the Clinton Federal Building, Washington
  D.C..  Twenty-five murals and twenty-two sculptural elements were completed, all
  having postal themes.   Marsh contributed the murals, <em>Sorting the Mail,</em>
  and <em>Unloading the Mail</em>. The Clinton Federal Building is now home to the
  Environmental Protection Agency and is not open to the general public. In 1937 Marsh
  completed a series of New York Harbor subjects in panels along the dome of the U.S.
  Custom House in lower Manhattan.  This project was funded by Treasury Relief Art
  Project, (TRAP). These murals can still be viewed by the public in their original
  setting, however the building is now occupied by The National Museum of the American
  Indian, and in the upper floors are the offices of the New York branch of the National
  Archives, (guardians of the Reginald Marsh papers).</p>"
