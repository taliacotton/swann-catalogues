Signed and dated in pencil, lower right recto.  1939. <br><br>Born in Beverly, Massachusetts, Barnet attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston from 1928-30.  He later won a 3-year scholarship to the Art Students League, New York, where he focused on printmaking.  Throughout his career, he mastered a variety of techniques, including etching, woodcut and lithography, such as the current lot.  An extremely dynamic artist, Barnet changed his style significantly throughout his career.
