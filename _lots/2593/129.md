Burne-Jones 110.<br><br>Kent's <i>And Now Where?</i> originally appeared to the public in <i>The New York Woman</i> magazine in 1936.  Kent was a WPA muralist who was then known for his controversial commission for the Post Office in Washington, DC (now the Clinton Federal Building). The mural portrayed Puerto Rico's first airmail delivery and seemed to sympathize with the cause for Puerto Rican independence. A woman is shown with a letter in Kuskokwim Eskimo dialect that reads \"To the people of Puerto Rico, our friends! Let us change chiefs. That alone can make us equal and free!\""
