Circa 1945.  <br><br>A very good impression of this scarce screenprint. <br><br>Gottlieb was born in Bucharest, but immigrated to Minnesota with his family when he was twelve years old and studied at the Minneapolis Institue of Art. He served as an illustrator for the Navy during World War I, then moved to New York City where, influenced by the Ashcan School, he began painting in a social realist style. In 1935, he joined the Federal Art Project in the Silk Screen Unit where he was first introduced to the silkscreen method of printmaking. The WPA was integral in the promotion of silkscreening as an artistic technique; developed in the early 1900s it had been used mostly for commercial purposes. Gottlieb continued to be a pioneer of the medium beyond his work with the WPA."
