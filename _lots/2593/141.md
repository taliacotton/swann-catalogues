TYPESET: 'Brush and ink and wash on heavy cream wove paper, double-sided.  570x785
  mm; 22½x31 inches.  Signed and dated in ink lower right on one side of the sheet.  1951.<br><br>Born
  in Paris, the second son in a well-to-do family, Marsh attended Yale University
  and then moved to New York where, during the early 1920s, he worked as an illustrator
  and took classes at the Art Students League. Marsh was equally influenced by his
  art teachers in New York, notably John Sloan (1871-1951), as well as American Regionalists
  like Thomas Hart Benton (1889-1975) and Old Masters such as Rubens, Titian and Tintoretto.
  He wholly rejected the modern artistic movements gaining strength in America at
  the time—Cubism, Surrealism, Abstraction. Instead he pursued a style that is best
  summed up as social realism: depictions of everyday life in New York, Coney Island
  beach scenes, vaudeville and burlesque women, the jobless on the streets of New
  York and the railroad yards and freight trains in New York and New Jersey.<br><br>Marsh  participated
  in the federal art programs under the WPA, painting two murals in Washington, DC,
  and, funded by the Treasury Relief Art Project, completed a series of frescoes in
  the New York Customs House, now the National Museum of the American Indian, that
  depict eight New York Harbor scenes and eight portraits of great navigators.  It
  is one of the most celebrated mural installations created under the New Deal in
  New York City.'
