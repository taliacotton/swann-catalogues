  block on both sides to make color woodcuts, though she printed from it infrequently
  before retiring it to its current state as a painted wood block.   Impressions printed
  from either side of this wood block are exceedingly scarce.   According to Lazzell's
  record book, only 2 impressions of <i>Cape Cod Cottage</i> and 3 impressions of
  <i>Coffee Pot</i> were printed by the artist.  We have not found any impressions
  from this block at auction in the past 30 years. <br><br>Another original carved

  and designer.  Known especially for her colorful woodcuts, she was an early modernist
  artist, at the vanguard of the avant-garde in American art, bringing elements of
  Cubism and abstraction into her craft.  Lazzell made color woodcuts under the auspices
  of the WPA during the 1930s, among them one of her most celebrated works, <i>The
  Blue Jug </i>, 1937, the design of which is similar to <i>The Coffee Pot</i> on
  one side of the current work.  Lazzell was also a participant in a landmakr exhibition
  of WPA works in 1936, "New Horizons in American Art," curated by Holger Cahill,
  who was the national director of the WPA.
