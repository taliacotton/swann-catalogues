Description: "CHARLES KELLER (1914-2006)\nConcrete Foundations, 6th Avenue Subway. Lithograph. 351x434 mm; 13x17 inches, wide margins. Edition of approximately 25 proofs. Signed, dedicated and titled in pencil, lower margin. 1939.A very good impression of this scarce lithograph. Keller was active in New York during the 1930s-40s, and was part of an artists' community in Union Square, where he shared a studio with Harry Sternberg (1904-2001), whom he assisted on murals, including those for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Among Keller's best known works are the lithographs and drawings he made of workers constructing Manhattan's Sixth Avenue subway line during the 1930s. Completed in 1940 and among the costliest and complex commuter rail projects in New York, the Sixth Avenue subway replaced the Sixth Avenue elevated which closed in 1939."
