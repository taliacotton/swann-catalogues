Before becoming employed by the Federal Art Project in the graphics division in 1935 in New York, she attended the Art Students League. Lurie's first solo exhibition was held in 1947 at Feigl Gallery, New York, where she showed her increasingly abstract paintings, a departure from her earlier representative works with political overtones."
