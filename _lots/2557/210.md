While participating with the WPA, Schanker worked as an artist and supervisor in the mural division and the graphics division, eventually becoming the director of the graphic arts division. His murals for the Neponsit Beach Children's Hospital in Rockaway, Queens depict circus scenes similar to Aerial Act, likely influenced from his time working at Barnum & Bailey circus while living an itinerant lifestyle earlier in his life.
