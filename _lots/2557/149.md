He studied at Cooper Union and the National Academy of Design. During World War I, he became interested in politics and began making illustrations for radical political publications. A member of the Communist Party of America, he focused his career on making artwork that was accessible to the public, such as illustrations in newspapers and magazines, murals and posters. In 1938, he painted the murals at the Communications Building at the New York World's Fair; during the fair's planning he also oversaw he formation of a labor union to protect the rights of artists as it was being planned. He continued to remain loyal to the Communist Party throughout his career and life, founding the American Artist's Congress, a Communist organization, and eventually facing investigation by the House of Un-American Activities Committee."
