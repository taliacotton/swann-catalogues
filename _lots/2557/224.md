Signed in pencil, lower right. 1927.A very good impression of this scarce lithograph.By the time Zorach was employed by the WPA as a muralist, she had already become one of the leading vanguards of the American modernist movement, having exhibited in the 1913 Armory show. Eventually, Zorach settled in New England, painting WPA murals for the Peterborough, New Hampshire post office (1938). Later, she painted the Treasury Section of Fine Arts murals for post offices in Ripley, Tennessee (1940), and Monticello, Indiana (1942)."
