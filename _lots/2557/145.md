He studied at the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Growing up amongst financial hardships, he chose to focus his artistic career on depicting the difficult social realities around him, even as there was a broader interest in modernism among artistic circles. His work produced during the Depression was especially poignant, illustrating the emotional toll many people underwent during that time. He was among the artists employed by the federal government, joining when the Public Works of Art Project was first formed."
