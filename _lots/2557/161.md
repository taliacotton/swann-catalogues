In 1933 she joined the Public Works of Art Project in Omaha and moved to New York in 1935. Though she had a foundation in illustration and painting, Olds is known as one of the pioneers of the fine art application of the screenprint while working in the Works Progress Administration's graphics division. Olds also painted a mural, \"Pittsburgh\", at the Queens Borough Public Library, New York, though the present location and survival of this work is unknown, as is the case with many WPA murals. After the WPA, Olds went on to publish six children's books and continued to exhibit her works."
