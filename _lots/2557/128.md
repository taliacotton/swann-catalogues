Description: "LEON BIBEL (1913-1995)\nFood Not Cannon. Etching. 190x151 mm; 7Â½x5 inches, full margins. Edition of approximately 12. Signed in pencil, lower margin. 1937.A very good impression of this scarce proof-like etching.Bibel was born in Poland and immigrated to the United States, settling in San Francisco with his family. He studied at the California School of Fine Arts before moving to New York in 1936 to work for the Federal Arts Project. He worked as a WPA artist for nine years as a Federal Arts Project muralist and a WPA Arts Project administrator. When the program ended, he moved to New Jersey with a group of artists who became chicken farmers. George Segal (1924-2000) was among the group of artists and they formed a close friendship. When Segal created his sculpture Bread Line for the FDR Memorial in the 1990s, which depicted Depression-era figures waiting in line for a meal, one of the figures resembled Bibel who himself stood in breadlines during the Depression."
