Description: "LEWIS RUBENSTEIN (1908-2003)\nFoundry. Lithograph. 406x260 mm; 16x10Â¼ inches, full margins. Signed and numbered 6/40 in pencil, lower margin. 1938.A very good impression. Muralist Rubenstein was most well-known for his controversial anti-fascist and anti-German mural commissioned by his alma mater Harvard University in 1930. His painting for the Wareham, Massachusetts post office commissioned by the Treasury Section of the Fine Arts in 1940 was less controversial. \"Cranberry Pickers\" celebrated the harvesters of Massachusetts' most important agricultural export. The migrant workers depicted in the mural are dignified and are painted in a style reminiscent of the Renaissance, which Lewis had studied on a fellowship from Harvard."
