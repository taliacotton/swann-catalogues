Her graphic print portfolios took inspiration from a range of experiences--from scenes of new industry to museum artifacts she encountered. After winning two Guggenheim fellowships in the 1930s, she travelled to Mexico and became well-known and widely respected as a regionalist painter, eventually settling in Oaxaca permanently. She exhibited alongside Marguerite Zorach (1887-1968) at the 1933 Chicago Worlds' Fair."
