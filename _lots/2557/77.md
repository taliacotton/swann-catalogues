Published by the Works Progress Administration, New York with the ink stamp lower left. Circa 1939. A very good impression.Weller was a photographer and printmaker who was employed by the WPA Federal Art Project. In 1938 he exhibited in the groundbreaking \"Subway Art\" at The Museum of Modern Art, New York. This exhibition featured artists' designs meant to decorate the underground stations. A model of a subway station showing the art and sculptures in situ was built and lent to the museum by the New York WPA Federal Art Project. Fine art in the subway stations was never before used in the country and the materials had to be resistent to vibration and varying temperatures. The city still commissions art for its subway stations today."
