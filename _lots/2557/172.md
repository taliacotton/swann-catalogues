Fine/Looney 176.Spruance was born in Philadelphia, where he studied and remained to work and teach for most of his life. The heart of Spruance's practice was lithography, and he created over 550 prints over the course of his career. He favored religious themes and modernist abstraction, but during the WPA era he created many prints in the social realist style reminiscent of the Aschan school."
