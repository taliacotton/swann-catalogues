Though she began the project in 1929, it wasn’t until 1935 that Abbott was accepted by the WPA Federal Art Project, working as a “supervisor” for the government program meant to employ artists and other related workers. The project resulted in a 1939 traveling exhibition and book called Changing New York, the latter of which reproduced 97 photographs and included text by Elizabeth McCausland."
