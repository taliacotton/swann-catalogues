He attended the Rhode Island School of Design, the Copley Society at Boston, and the Beaux Arts Institute of Design. He led an illustrious artistic career, teaching at Cooper Union and in 1940 winning the Guggenheim Scholarship. He favored common-place subjects like laundresses, cotton pickers, and garment workers using a direct carving method in a variety of media. He stated, \"I am primarily interested in telling the story of the age in which I am living.\" Song of the Shirt was also carved in mahoghany. During the 1930s many sewing machine operators had to bring their machines from home to factory each day, and often the easiest method was to carry the machine on their shoulders. While working in the sweatshops, female operators would often ease the hardships of their toil by singing together. The present lot was shown alongside WPA sculptures in a special exhibition of unionized sculptors at New School for Social Research in 1939."
