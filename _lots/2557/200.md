Kuniyoshi, born in Okayama, Japan came to the United States in 1906, settling in New York after briefly exploring the West Coast. During the mid-1930s, he worked in the graphics division of the Federal Arts Project while exhibiting his work internationally. Though his work was characterized as poetic and surreal, his fantastic scenes turned somber during World War II while he worked with the Office of War Information."
