Description: "ABRAHAM WALKOWITZ (1878-1965)\nUntitled. Oil on canvasboard. 356x273 mm; 14x10 Inches. Signed, A. Walkowitz, lower right.Provenance: The Collection of Gladys and Tully Filmus; Thence by descent to the current owner.As early as 1908, Abraham Walkowitz created modenist compositions radically advanced for an artist working in the Americas. Championed by Alfred Stieglitz, an influencial artist and art dealer of independent means, Walkowitz did not suffer the extreme hardships of so many in the decade between the depression and the second world war. His contribution to the New Deal came not from his brush and pallette, rather through his voice as an advocate for the expansion of programs to employ more young artists."
