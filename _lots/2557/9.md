  White Calf. Lithograph. 253x325 mm; 10x12 inches, wide margins. Edition of 250. Signed in pencil, lower right. Published by Associated American Artists, New York. 1945.A very good impression. Fath 67. <QLBenton was already seen as a leader in the Regionalist movement and a celebrated muralist by the time the WPA started the Federal Arts Program. He had been commissioned to paint murals of life in Indiana for the 1933 Century of Progress Exhibition in Chicago, which caused controversy. In 1934 his work was featured on the cover on Time magazine, which legitimized Regionalism as an art movement. His murals were influential for the artists hired as muralists under the WPA.
