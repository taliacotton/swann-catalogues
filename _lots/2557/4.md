Circa 1936. \"Katherine Milhous created some of the most distinctive posters produced by the WPA. She was a supervisor of the FAP [Federal Arts Project] in Philadelphia (her birthplace and lifelong home), from 1935-1940. . . . Her deep affection for the locality's history and people is apparent in her depictions of the Amish and Mennonites\" (WPA p. 164).
