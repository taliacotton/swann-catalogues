DESCRIPT: GEORGES ROUAULT
CROSSHEAD: Automne.
TYPESET: Color aquatint, 1938. 510x665 mm; 20⅛x26¼ inches, wide margins. Signed in
  ink and numbered 66/175 in pencil, lower right. Printed by Lacourière, Paris. Published
  by Vollard, Paris. A brilliant, richly-inked impression of this large important
  print, with vibrant colors.<br><br>Rouault (1871-1958) was among the foremost printmakers
  of the early 20th century, translating his heavily-contoured, colorful paintings
  into richly-inked, painterly aquatints with the help of the Parisian master-printer,
  Roger Lacourière. In the late 1880s, Rouault had trained as an apprentice with a
  glass painter and restorer and, in the early 1890s, studied at the <i>École des
  Beaux-Arts</i>, Paris, under the symbolist master, Gustave Moreau (1826-1898). Both
  these experiences certainly influenced his style, as did his friendships at the
  turn-of-the-century with some of the leading Fauves, including Henri Matisse, Albert
  Marquet and Henri Manguin.<br><br><i>Automne</i> is Rouault's<i> tour-de-force</i>
  and a secular stand-out in a printmaking oeuvre with a concentration on religious,
  spiritual and Biblical themes. It is among his most colorful, technically complex
  and largest prints, as well as a precursor to the large aquatints favored by Picasso
  and Matisse from the 1950s and 1960s. Chapon/Rouault 288; Wofsy 285.
