DESCRIPT: "REMBRANDT VAN RIJN"
CROSSHEAD: "The Flute Player."
TYPESET: "Etching and drypoint, 1642.  114x143 mm; 4½x5⅝ inches, thread margins.  Biörklund's fifth state (of 5); Usticke's fifth state (of 5); New Hollstein fourth state (of 4).  A very good, well-inked impression with strong contrasts.<br><br>According to Usticke, \"A scarce plate (R+).\"<br><br>The figure of the lascivious male flute player, a popular folk-tale character from the early 16th century onward, was well-known to Dutch art connoisseurs in Rembrandt's time as the <i>Eulenspiegel (or Owl-glass)</i>, and Rembrandt has conspicuously placed a tame owl on the shepherd's shoulder in this etching to further the point.  The <i>Eulenspiegel</i> was known to be a wily, shifty character, whom Rembrandt has represented here with a flute suggestively directed at the seated shepherdess while he steals a glance beneath the hem of her dress.  Bartsch 188; Biörklund 32-D; Hollstein (White and Boon) 188."
