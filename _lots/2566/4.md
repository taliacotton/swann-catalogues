DESCRIPT: ALBRECHT DÜRER
CROSSHEAD: The Sea Monster.
TYPESET: Engraving, before 1500.  251x188 mm; 10x7⅜ inches, thread margins.  A very
  good, evenly-printed, well-inked Meder k impression with strong contrasts and little
  to no sign of wear.  Small bunch of grapes with the letters AP watermark (Meder
  130, which he dates to around 1570).<br><br>Dürer (1471-1528) opened his own artistic
  workshop in the spring of 1495.  In the years leading up to this significant development
  in his career, he had trained extensively during his teens with his father, a talented
  goldsmith, as well as with the Nuremberg painter-printmaker, Michael Wolgemut for
  three years (1486-89) and traveled extensively through southern Germany, Austria
  and northern Italy, making a journey to Venice and likely Padua and Mantua from
  the autumn of 1494 to the spring of 1495.  According to Bartrum, "He was particularly
  impressed by the work of artists such as Andrea Mantegna (1431-1506), Giovanni Bellini
  (circa 1430/40-1516) and Antonio del Pollaiuolo (circa 1432-1498)," (Bartrum, <i>Albrecht
  Dürer and his Legacy</i>, London, 2002, page 105).<br><br><i>The Sea Monster</i>
  is, along with <i>Hercules, or the Effects of Jealousy</i>, one of Dürer's largest
  and most ambitious engravings of his early career up to around 1500.  They are clearly
  both <i>tour-de-force</i> printmaking efforts by the young artist—who was not yet
  30 years old--to achieve acclaim and prestige, much like his <i>Apocalypse</i> woodcut
  series from the 1490s.  The engravings, however, evince Dürer's profound emulation
  of Italianate artistic styles of the time, notably the work of Mantegna.  In <i>The
  Sea Monster</i>, Dürer combines a Germanic setting (there is a view of Nuremberg
  castle in the background) with a figural group highly influenced by, if not lifted
  from, a Mantegna school composition.  The nymph who is apparently being abducted
  by the sea monster also wears an elaborate hairstyle that was popular with upper-class
  Milanese women at the time.<br><br>Bartrum  notes that Dürer sensed early on in
  his career, during the late 1400s and the opening of his workshop, that printmaking
  would be his path to success and fame, "By choosing to make engravings rather than
  copy them in singular luxury objects, Dürer could imprint his art on the products
  of his father's trade, effectively reversing his filial relation through creative
  priority . . . Most importantly, he had a highly developed commercial sense; by
  1497 he had already hired an agent, Contz Schwytzer, to handle his foreign print
  sales" (Bartrum, pages 21 and 106).  Bartsch 71; Meder 66.
