DESCRIPT: JOSEPH M. W. TURNER
CROSSHEAD: Mer de Glace, Valley of Chamonix, Savoy.
TYPESET: Mezzotint and engraving printed in dark brownish black on cream laid paper,
  circa 1817-18.  220x298 mm; 8¾x11¾ inches, full margins.  First state (of 6).  From
  the <i>Liber Studiorum</i>.  A superb, richly-inked impression.<br><br><i>Mer de
  Glace, Valley of Chamonix, Savoy</i> is part of a series of 81 mezzotints created
  by Turner (1775-1851) and other printmakers, after his oils, that have come to be
  known as the <i>Liber Studiorum</i>.  These mezzotints are based on original watercolors
  by Turner, which are turn derived from his paintings, essentially a visual catalogue
  <i>raisonné</i> of all his works.   It's assumed that Turner approved of the mezzotint
  process as it simulated the appearance of watercolor on moist paper and, in recognition
  of their commercial viability.  The 1820 introduction of steel mezzotint plates
  (as opposed to copper, which produced very limited quality impressions before the
  plate wore down and required reworking) may have prompted him to issue these prints.<br><br>The
  <i>Liber Studiorum</i> series was produced primarily by Charles Turner and other
  engravers under the direction of J.M.W. Turner, with Turner himself working on 11
  of the plates (including this one).   Turner also produced the 12 additional plates
  which comprise the <i>Little Liber Studiorum</i>, a series of prints that was a
  sequel to the <i>Liber Studiorum</i>.  The <i>Liber Studiorum</i> encompassed the
  entire <i>oeuvre</i> of Turner's work by mixing historical, pastoral, architectural
  and landscape scenes, while the <i>Little Liber Studiorum</i> presents ethereal
  atmospheric landscapes, representative of the iconic paintings for which he is now
  famous.  Finberg 50.
