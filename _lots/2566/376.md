  to Heather Hess, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, German Expressionist Digital
  Archive Project, <i>Yali und sein Weisses Weib</i> (Yali and his White Wife) is
  a fictional story of an innocent European woman in a fantastical exotic land.  She
  is a survivor of a shipwreck, and is then subsequently spared from massacre by the
  Ona tribe, who kill the rest of the survivors. The Ona tribe raises her as one of
  their own.  She flees when Yali, a warrior in the tribe, attempts to abduct her,
  living happily alone in nature until she is recaptured and forced to marry Yali.  Though
  the story is set in South America, Pechstein's drawings are based on his experience
  in the South Pacific.  Both the text and the illustrations emphasize the woman's
  snow-white purity and depict the tribespeople as animalistic, hypersexual and uncivilized,
  typical of the European view of foreign lands in the 1920s.  Krüger 136-144.
