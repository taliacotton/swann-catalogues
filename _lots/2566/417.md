  (1887-1985) was born in present-day Belarus, then part of the Russian Empire, to
  a devoutly Jewish family. He learned to draw in primary school and from a local
  artist before continuing his studies in St. Petersburg. In 1910, having found a
  patron to support him, Chagall moved to Paris and settled within the bohemian <i>avant-garde</i>
  community of painters and poets in Montparnasse. Under the influence of the Expressionist
  and Cubist artists, in addition to the Fauves and Impressionists he viewed in the
  museums, in Paris Chagall was encouraged to explore his nontraditional style. <br><br>During
  the 1910s, Chagall's palette grew more colorful and saturated and he became known
  for his figurative elements in arbitrary, dreamlike compositions inspired by Russian
  or Yiddish folklore and culture. Chagall held his first solo exhibition in Berlin
  in 1914 and continued to paint through World War I. After migrating between Russia
  and Berlin, Chagall and his family again settled in Paris, where he learned engraving.
  Ambroise Vollard commissioned him to create a series of etchings in 1923 and after
  the initial project, Chagall returned to printmaking throughout his long and prolific
  career. Kornfeld 42.
