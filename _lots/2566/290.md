TYPESET: "Linoleum cut printed in cream white and then washed in black India ink and rinsed (<i>rincée</i>) so that the lines become black, 1963.  530x640 mm; 20⅞x25¼ inches, full margins.  Artist's proof, aside from the edition of 50.  Printed by Arnéra, Vallauris.  Published by Galerie Louise Leiris, Paris.  A very good impression.  <br><br>Picasso conceived the process of rinsing prints, known as <i>épreuves rincées</i>, in the early 1960s. After printing a heavy deposit of ink, often white, onto the paper, the entire sheet is rinsed with water based dye which adheres only to the areas left blank and creates shadowy, sometimes uneven effects in the lines and at the borders.  Bloch 1150; Baer 1344."
