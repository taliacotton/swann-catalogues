With Thornley's blind stamp twice, lower center and lower right. Printed by Atelier Becquet, Paris. Published by Boussod-Valadon, Paris. From <i>Quinze Lithographies</i>. A very good impression.<br><br>Degas (1834-1917) was likely influenced to collaborate with the lithographer Thornley by Theo Van Gogh, the influential director of the Boussod-Valadon Gallery in Paris, and as a result of Thornley's masterful lithographic interpretations of drawings by Puvis de Chavannes. By 1888, Degas and Thornley were working together to produce a portfolio of 15 lithographs based on drawings by Degas. The portfolio was issued in 1889 in an edition of 100, plus an additional deluxe edition of 25 with each of the prints signed by both artists. Reed/Shapiro p. lvii."
