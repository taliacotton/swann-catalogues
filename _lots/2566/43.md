TYPESET: "<br><i>The Triumphs of Julius Caesar</i>.<br><br>Two chiaroscuro woodcuts printed in dark olive brown, tan and black on cream laid paper, 1599. Both approximately 361x372 mm; 14<AF1/4>x14<AF5/8> inches. Both very good, richly-inked impressions with strong colors.<br><br>Andreani's (1540-1623) frieze of 9 chiaroscuro woodcuts (there is also a woodcut title page on a tenth sheet) depicts <i>The Triumphs of Julius Caesar</i> after a series of 9 paintings created by Andrea Mantegna (1431-1506) between 1484 and 1492 for the Gonzaga Ducal Palace in Mantua, notably the triumphal military parade celebrating the victory of Caesar in the Gallic Wars (58 BCâ€“51 BC). This is among of the most ambitious and technically complex print series made during the 16th century and required a team of highly-skilled craftsmen, from the artist, woodblock carvers and printers, to the artisans who mixed the inks and the mills which produced the paper.
