DESCRIPT: REMBRANDT VAN RIJN
CROSSHEAD: 'Self Portrait in a Cap and Scarf with the Face Dark: Bust.'
TYPESET: Etching, 1633.  135x105 mm; 5⅜x4 inches, wide margins.  Biörklund's third
  state (of 3); Usticke's third state (of 5); New Hollstein third state (of 5).  Ex-collection
  Pierre Sentuc (Lugt 3608, verso).  A very good impression.<br><br>Rembrandt (1606-1669)
  etched some 30 self-portraits, with 27 singular images of himself and several others
  of himself in different guises or grouped with other portrait studies. This self-portrait,
  created at the age of 27, two years after he had moved to Amsterdam from Leyden
  to begin to establish himself as a successful independent artist, and months before
  he married Saskia van Uylenburgh, is among Rembrandt's most introspective self-renderings.
  The dark shading covering much of his face (which rapidly disappears in later impressions),
  the deep-set eyes and his quiet, hunched pose lend an almost shy, reserved appearance,
  which is markedly different from the proud, bright, frontal poses of his self-portraits
  from the mid-to-late-1630s. Bartsch 17; Biörklund 33-G; Hollstein (White and Boon)
  17.
