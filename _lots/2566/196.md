pullquote: At the end of the 19th century, Monet (1840-1926), Edgar Degas (1834-1917)
  and Camille Pissarro (1830-1903) rediscovered lithography as a medium both to recreate
  their artistic conceptions on paper and simultaneously achieve widespread distribution
  of and acclamation for their work. These artists, who had invented new ways of transmitting
  impressions of light and color, changing the course of art, engaged George William
  Thornley (1857-1935), an accomplished English lithographer and admirer of the Impressionists,
  to translate their designs into lithographs. The prints that emerged from these
  collaborative efforts are the only lithographs in color, save one by Pissarro, by
  these great Impressionist artists.
