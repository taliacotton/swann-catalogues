DESCRIPT: JAMES A. M. WHISTLER
CROSSHEAD: Long Lagoon.
TYPESET: Etching and drypoint printed in dark brownish black on cream laid paper,
  1879-80.  154x228 mm; 6Â¼x9 inches.  MacDonald's second state (of 2), before cancellation.  Edition
  of approximately 30.  Signed with the butterfly and inscribed "imp" in pencil on
  the tab, lower left.  From <i>Twenty-Six Etchings</i>.  A superb, warm impression
  of this very scarce etching, with selective wiping in the water and inky plate edges.<br><br>In
  July 1879, the Fine Art Society of London commissioned Whistler (1834-1903) to visit
  Venice and return by December with a set of 12 etched plates.  Whistler eagerly
  accepted the commission, which  gave him the chance to recoup his losses from the
  Ruskin trial and cover costs on the design of his "White House" in Chelsea (the
  house and contents were auctioned after he declared bankruptcy in 1879) and likely  also
  the means to remove himself from London. One of the ironies of the Ruskin libel
  case is that the Fine Art Society had organized a collection to pay for Ruskin's
  legal costs; they subsequently gave Whistler the Venice commission and with it the
  opportunity to get out of the debt incurred by the trial.<br><br>Whistler and his
  then model and mistress Maud Franklin arrived in Venice in September 1879 and remained
  there until November 1880.  During this time, he produced far more than the dozen
  etchings stipulated by the commission; he returned from Venice with over 50 etchings,
  several nocturne paintings and around a hundred pastels.<br><br>The Venice etchings
  are in many ways a continuation of the themes he had been exploring in his 1860s/late
  1870s etchings and lithographs of London and The Thames.  These repeat characteristics
  include a sketch-like, drawn from nature quality, with an indifference to topographical
  accuracy and depth.  Many of the Venice etchings, with watery foregrounds and high
  horizon lines, or directly frontal views of building facades, seem very two-dimensional.  A
  number of the Venice scenes have a vignette-like appearance, with central compositions
  and considerable blank space at the edges of the sheet.  Kennedy 203; Glasgow 243.
