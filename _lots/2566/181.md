DESCRIPT: JAMES A. M. WHISTLER
CROSSHEAD: The Wine Glass.
TYPESET: Etching on cream laid paper, 1859.  83x55 mm; 3¼x2⅛ inches, wide margins.  MacDonald's
  second state (of 2), with the additional vertical shading lines in the background.  A
  superb, richly-inked impression of this very scarce, early etching, with all the
  details distinct and with very strong contrasts.<br><br>As Getscher notes in <i>The
  Stamp of Whistler</i>, "Whistler was a very social animal," (Oberlin, 1977, page
  13).  His social ease was a great aid during his early years in Paris from 1855
  to 1859.  Through his short training in the studio of Parisian artist Charles Gleyre
  (1806-1874), he met a group of local artists who helped him adapt to life in the
  new city.  His friendship with the artist Henri Fantin-Latour, which developed while
  they were copying paintings by the masters in the Louvre, led him into an artistic
  circle that included luminaries of French painting at the time such as Gustave Courbet
  (1819-1877), Carolus-Duran (1837-1917) and Édouard Manet (1832-1883).  Another associate
  of this group was the influential Parisian author and critic Charles Baudelaire
  (1821-1867), who was an early champion of Whistler's work.<br><br>Whistler also
  visited London frequently from 1855 to 1858, mainly to see his half-sister Deborah,
  who had married the artist Francis Seymour Haden (1818-1910), and her family.  These
  visits provided the subjects for more of his etchings from this time and prepared
  the way for his move to London in 1859.<br><br>This still-life study, which stands
  alone in Whistler's etched <i>oeuvre</i>, was made shortly after his return to London
  from Paris upon the completion of the "French Set" or <i>Douze eaux-fortes d'après
  Nature</i>. Whistler and his brother-in-law worked closely for several months during
  this time at the latter's house on Sloane Street, London, where Haden had installed
  his own etching press.  Kennedy 27; Glasgow 38.
