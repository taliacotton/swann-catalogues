DESCRIPT: PIETER COECKE VAN AELST (after)
CROSSHEAD: Procession of Sultan Süleyman through the Atmeidan from the frieze Customs
  and Fashions of the Turks.
TYPESET: "<p>Group of 4 (of 7) woodcuts, circa 1553. Each approximately 332x470 mm;
  13x18½ inches (sheets), wide margins, the four sheets forming a connected, continuous
  frieze. One sheet with a Strasburg Lily watermark. Good impressions of these exceedingly
  scarce woodcuts.<br><br>We have found only 2 other sets of the woodcuts at auction
  in the past 30 years.<br><br>Van Aelst (1502-1550) traveled to Constantinople in
  1533; he appears to have been part of an expedition sent by the Brussels-based Dermoyen
  firm to negotiate a sale of tapestries to the Sultan Süleyman. The firm may have
  been hoping that Süleyman, wanting to rival Western monarchs, would commission a
  set of tapestries glorifying his reign, possibly based on the designs rendered in
  this frieze. The tapestry commission appears never to have materialized. Van Aelst's
  widow published the woodcut frieze 20 years after her husband executed the designs
  created during or soon after his journey to Constantinople. Hollstein 4.</p>"
