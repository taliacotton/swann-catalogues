TYPESET: "Engraving, circa 1590-95.  154x112 mm; 6¼x4½ inches, thread margins.  A very good impression of this extremely scarce engraving.<br><br>This is one of a dozen or so prints of mythological and biblical subjects, of a similar size format, which scholars have traditionally grouped as what is known as Carracci's (1557-1602) <i>Lascivie</i>, even though there is no clear indication the artist ever intended these as a series.  These subjects by Carracci evidently caused the wrath of Pope Clement VIII (1592-1605) who rebuked Carracci for his lack of decorum.  Bartsch 135."
