  Jules Michelin (Lugt 1490; acquired from the D. G. de Arozarena collection, see
  Lugt 109, his sale Clement, Paris, 1861, according to an inscription in ink, verso).
  A very good impression of this scarce etching with strong contrasts and little to
  no sign of wear.<br><br>With—<em>Le Troupeau à l'abreuvoir</em>, etching, 1635 (1665
  ?). 108x172 mm; 4 1/4x6 3/4 inches, narrow margins. Second state (of 3). Ex-collection
  Roger Passeron (Lugt 4096, verso). A superb, richly-inked impression.<br><br>Mannocci
  catalogues this print with the date 1635 (there is an illegible date scratched in
  the plate lower left to the right of the artist's signature), though he disputes
  the dating and explains that all the first state impressions he has seen of this
  plate "were printed on the thicker paper that Claude was using in the 1660s and
  not on the thin paper typical of the 30s" (Mannocci, page 126). It therefore appears
  that the correct date for the etching should be closer to 1665. Mannocci 34.</p>
