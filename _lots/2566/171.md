TYPESET: "<p>Woodcut printed in reddish brown on antique cream laid paper, circa 1865.
  188x131 mm; 7½x5¼ inches, full margins. Second state (of 3), with the artist's name
  added lower left. A very good impression of this extremely scarce woodcut.<br><br>According
  to Melot, Millet (1814-1875) created the design for this woodcut and the block was
  cut by the artist's brother, the painter Jean-Baptiste Millet (1831-1906). The work
  was included in Delteil's catalogue <em>raisonné</em> since he believed that Millet
  made the drawing directly on the block, which his brother later cut.<br><br>We have
  not found another impression at auction in the past 30 years. Melot cites only 4
  other impressions in public institutions. Delteil 34; Melot 34.</p>"
