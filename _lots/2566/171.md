TYPESET: "<i>JEAN-FRANÇOIS MILLET (after)</i><br><i>Becheur en repos</i>.<br><br>Woodcut printed in reddish brown on antique cream laid paper, circa 1865. 188x131 mm; 7½x5¼ inches, full margins. Second state (of 3), with the artist's name added lower left. A very good impression of this extremely scarce woodcut.<br><br>According to Melot, Millet (1814-1875) created the design for this woodcut and the block was cut by the artist's brother, the painter Jean-Baptiste Millet (1831-1906). The work was included in Delteil's catalogue <i>raisonné</i> since he believed that Millet made the drawing directly on the block, which his brother later cut.<br><br>We have not found another impression at auction in the past 30 years. Melot cites only 4 other impressions in public institutions. Delteil 34; Melot 34."
