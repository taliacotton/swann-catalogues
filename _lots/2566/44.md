TYPESET: "Engraving, 1586.  357x251 mm; 14Â¼x10 inches, small margins.  First state (of 2).  Cornucopia watermark.  A brilliant, early impression of this extremely scarce, large engraving with all the details distinct and little to no sign of wear.<br><br>This engraving is likely based on the oil portrait, now in the Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid, of Charles II by Sofonisba Anguissola (circa 1532-1625), a late Italian Renaissance painter born in Cremona.  In 1559 Anguissola was recruited by the Spanish queen, Elizabeth of Valois, who was herself an amateur portraitist, to go to Madrid as her tutor, with the rank of lady-in-waiting.  She later became an official court painter to the king, Philip II.  After the queen's death, Philip helped arrange an aristocratic marriage for Anguissola.  She moved to Sicily, and later Pisa and Genoa, where she continued to practice as a leading portrait painter. Hollstein 2134; Mauquoy-Hendrickx 1892."
