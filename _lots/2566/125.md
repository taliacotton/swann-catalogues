DESCRIPT: ANTONIO DA CANAL, IL CANALETTO
CROSSHEAD: An Imaginary View of Padua.
TYPESET: Etching, circa 1740.  301x425 mm; 12x16Â¾ inches, wide margins.  Second state
  (of 3).  The letter A countermark (?) to an unidentified watermark  (see Bromberg
  41).  A brilliant, richly-inked and early impression with vivid contrasts and no
  sign of wear, consistent with the earliest impressions of this subject.<br><br>Canaletto
  (1697-1768), whose work embodies the city of Venice perhaps more than any other
  artist, was a highly fashionable painter already known primarily for his topographical
  views that were popular among Europeans (particularly English visitors) on the Grand
  Tour, when he embarked on a series of some 30 Venice-inspired etchings in the early
  1740s.   This project was encouraged and principally financed by  Joseph Smith,
  the British consul to the Venetian Republic, who also acted as Canaletto's agent
  on behalf of foreign collectors.<br><br>Canaletto's etchings, most of which are
  <i>capricci</i>, or imaginary views, blend familiar Venetian (and outlying areas
  such as Padua) vernacular architectural elements with classical motifs.  His inspiration
  to idealize these views, many of which partially depict locations found along the
  Brenta Canal, running from the Venetian Bay inland to Padua (known as the "Brenta
  Riviera" and home to many opulent Veneto villas), probably came from his father
  who was a theatrical set designer. DeVesme 11; Bromberg 11.
