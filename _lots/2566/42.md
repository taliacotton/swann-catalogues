CROSSHEAD: Charles V.
TYPESET: "<p>Woodcut, after 1530. 485x342 mm; 19¼x13½ inches. Trimmed on the outside
  of the black border line. A good impression of this scarce woodcut.<br><br>This
  portrait was likely derived from or inspired by Giovanni Britto's (1500-1550) woodcut
  portrait of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (1500-1558), from circa 1535, that
  was based on Titian's (1490-1576) now lost oil portrait of the emperor (known from
  a copy by Peter Paul Rubens, 1577-1640, in the Courtauld Gallery, London; see Muraro
  and Rosand, <em>Tiziano e la Silografia Veneziana del Cinquecento</em>, Vicenza,
  1976, catalogue number 57). Britto's woodcut shows Charles V in armor, albeit without
  the plumed helmet that apparently appeared in Titian's oil portrait, as shown in
  the Ruben's copy. The current woodcut portrait depicts Charles V in full Holy Roman
  Emperor regalia. He was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Clement VII in Bologna
  on February 22, 1530, the last emperor to receive a papal coronation.</p>"
