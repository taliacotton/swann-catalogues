CROSSHEAD: "Landscape with an Obelisk."
TYPESET: "Etching and drypoint, circa 1650.  85x162 mm; 3½x6½ inches, narrow margins.  Biörklund's second state (of 2), with the diagonal shading on the lightly-etched smaller cottage and trees lower right; Usticke's second state (e)(of 2), with the sulphur tinting and delicate scratches in the sky distinct; White and Boon's second state (of 2).  Ex-collection Edward Peart (Lugt 891, lower left recto).  A superb, richly-inked and early impression of this very scarce landscape etching, with burr on the foliage lower center and lower right.<br><br>This is among Rembrandt's most inventive landscape compositions and shows his mastery of emphasizing depth, by focusing on darkly-etched farm buildings and an obelisk in the foreground and receding to much more lightly-sketched structures and a solitary figure in a field holding a scythe to the far right.  He likely drew this scene from nature; the \"obelisk\" is the boundary post near Halfweg on the Spaarndammerdijk, roughly the halfway-point between Amsterdam and Haarlem.  Bartsch 227; Biörklund 50-3; Hollstein (White and Boon) 227."
