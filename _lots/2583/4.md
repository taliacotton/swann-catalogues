FOOTNOTE: "Acquired directly from the Estate of David Berjman; to a Private South American Collector.\n\nChambi's fine photographs were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, New York from March 23-May 3, 1979. A successful portrait photographer, he operated a commercial studio in Cuzco for decades, where he sold carte-postale-size photographs. His poignant studies, which captured the handsome features of native peoples in the studio and in the field, were complemented by a longstanding interest in ancient Incan culture. \n\nHis panoramic and detailed views were the focus of an artistic project that occupied Chambi for decades. The prints were created independently on site, and produced as medium-format photographs.\n\nThe album was compiled and presented to R. Beyman and commemorated a conference celebrating Peru and its range of ancient to colonial-era architectural splendors. \n\nThe album is organized into distinct sections, and each of the photographs is carefully captioned. The photographs corresponding to the first three categories are credited or attributed to Salazar, an accomplished commercial photographer whose fine aesthetic and technical mastery integrate seamlessly with Chambi's refined visual sensibility. The album is composed of the following sections:\n \nI. Peru, Lima.
