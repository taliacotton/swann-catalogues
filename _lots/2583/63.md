FOOTNOTE: "From the Personal Collection of Aron M. Mathieu (1907-1996), founder of <i>Modern Photography</i> magazine.\n \nJohn Collier Jr. was a pioneer in the fields of visual and applied anthropology. At 12 years old, he apprenticed under Maynard Dixon, then married to Dorothea Lange. Following this experience, Collier began working as a freelance photographer in New Mexico and California, and he was hired by Roy Stryker to be part of the FSA project in 1941. Rather than continuing his photography in the Southwest, Collier was sent to New England to photograph rural communities. This period, in turn, led to his intense interest in anthropology and the connection between people and the land."
