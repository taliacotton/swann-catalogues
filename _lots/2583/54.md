FOOTNOTE: "From the Personal Collection of Aron M. Mathieu (1907-1996), founder of <i>Modern Photography</i> magazine.\n\nRudy Burckhardt produced this photograph of Paris very early in his career, shortly before emigrating from Switzerland to New York in 1934. Settled in Lower Manhattan, Burckhardt took the same street aesthetic he used in Paris and applied it to the excitement of New York. Robert Frank, his compatriot, would attack New York with similar gusto on his arrival in 1947. Burckhardt's New York photographs from 1937-40 were the subject of the Metropolitan Museum exhibition New York, N. Why?: Photographs by Rudy Burckhardt (2008). Vintage prints by Burckhardt from Paris are unknown to the market."
