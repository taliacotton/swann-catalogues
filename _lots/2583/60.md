Mathieu (1907-1996), founder of <i>Modern Photography</i> magazine.\n\nEdward Steichen included Ed Feingersh in MoMA's 1955 blockbuster exhibition The Family of Man. Feingersh was considered a very promising photographer at the time, although he died suddenly in 1961 with no trace of any of his photographs. In 1992 Jane Livingston published her significant book <i>The New York School: Photographs 1936-1963.</i> She commented in her foreword that she regretted not having been able to locate any work by Ed Feingersh."
