FOOTNOTE: "Sidibé was a frequent attendee of the late night social scene in Mali during the 1960s and 1970s where he would photograph young men and women partying, posing, and dancing to Western music. Following the event he would process the film and print proof prints, which he mounted to a folder with the inscribed event date and individual inventory numbers. Party attendees could then place orders for the photographs. Through this form of documentation, Sidibé became a chronicler of the independence and transformation of Mali."
