FOOTNOTE: "From the Personal Collection of Aron M. Mathieu (1907-1996), founder of <i>Modern Photography</i> magazine.\n\nCharles Peterson was a former jazz guitarist, who became a jazz photographer, and is now remembered as the first to candidly document musicians at work. His photographs appeared in numerous publications, including Time, Life, Town and Country, Esquire and Down Beat, capturing the debut of Benny Goodman's first band at the Roosevelt Grill, the first jam session between Tommy Dorsey and Louis Armstrong backstage at the Paramount Theater, and Billie Holiday's first recording of “Strange Fruit.” He met Edward Steichen, who encouraged his work, and Peterson took a year to study at Clarence White's school."
