FOOTNOTE: "Though Evans originally intended to start his career as a writer, he took up photography and employed literary techniques to create his powerful, often narrative imagery. In 1935, Evans was asked by the government to photograph one of their resettlement communities for the Department of the Interior. This led to his hiring by the Resettlement Administration. Working under Roy Stryker, Evans photographed rural towns, creating architectural images of churches and roadside stores, as well as striking portraits of farmers and sharecroppers."
