FOOTNOTE: "Provenance: the Estate of Andy Warhol; to the Private Collection of Frederick W. Hughes; gifted to the present owner in 1992. \n\nThe magazine <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> commissioned Andy Warhol to do a layout for an arts feature in 1963, marking the beginnings of a three-year obsession with the format. The photo booth, a space designed both for mass entertainment and, with it's neatly drawn curtain, for privacy, allows the sitter to adopt or perform a chosen role, each captured in a single frame. The resulting strip is like a snippet of film footage, one that is both performative and secrative. Serial, mechanical, the photo booth easily intersected with Warhol's aesthetic of passivity, detachment, and celebrity. Warhol commissioned or appeared in hundreds of photo booth portraits."
