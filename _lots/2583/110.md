FOOTNOTE: "President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps in 1961. After Kennedy's assassination, President Lyndon B. Johnson launched his War on Poverty initiative, signing the Office of Economic Opportunity Act. This legislative initiative would eventually provide job training, work study programs, loans and grants to poor farmers, and a domestic volunteer service that cooperated with local governments and communities. Programs such as VISTA, Job Corps, Community Action Program, and Head Start all fell under the OEO administration, which was dubbed the domestic Peace Corps."
