FOOTNOTE: "From a Private Chicago Collection. <br>During World War II, Cartier-Bresson escaped a prisoner of war camp after being held captive for three years. Subsequently he returned to the United States to prepare an exhibition of his work at The Museum of Modern Art. The exhibition catalogue <i>The Photographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson</i> was published in 1947 and contained essays by Lincoln Kirstein and Beaumont Newhall. According to Peter Galassi: \"Beaumont and Nancy Newhall had begun work on the exhibition during the war, before it was known that Cartier-Bresson had survived; thus the photographer had the rare opportunity of participating in his own 'posthumous' exhibition.\"<br>\nArbaizar and Clair, <I>Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Image and The World<D> (Thames & Hudson), pl. 79.<br>\nCartier-Bresson, <I>The Decisive Moment<D> (Simon & Schuster / Éditions Verve), pl. 34.<br>\nChéroux, <I>Henri Cartier-Bresson: Here and Now<D> (Thames & Hudson), pl. 205. \nClair, <I>Henri Cartier-Bresson: Europeans<D> (Thames & Hudson), p. 147.<br>\nGalassi, <I>Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Modern Century<D> (The Museum of Modern Art, New York), p. 106.<br> \nKirstein and Newhall, <I>The Photographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson<D> (The Museum of Modern Art, New York), p. 40.<br>\nMontier, <I>Henri Cartier-Bresson and the Artless Art<D> (Thames & Hudson), pl. 151."
