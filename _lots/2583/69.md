FOOTNOTE: "Consuelo Kanaga worked as a reporter and then staff photographer for the San Francisco Chronicle starting in 1915. There she became a member of the city's artistic community, including Imogen Cunningham, Dorothea Lange, and Edward Weston. Later, in New York, Alfred Stieglitz would also exert a strong influence over the trajectory of her work as an artist. Kanaga's oeuvre was eclectic, but she is remembered today as a champion of civil rights, documenting social inequities with sensitivity and compassion."
