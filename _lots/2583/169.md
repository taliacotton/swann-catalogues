FOOTNOTE: "Gifted by van der Elsken to a family member. \n\nOften best recognized for his moody black and white photographs, Ed van der Elsken was one of the first Dutch photojournalists to embrace color photography, having begun photographing in color in the early 1950s. Much of his work after 1960 was made in color. This family portrait, which features a self-portrait of van der Elsken in the mirror, was taken in 1954, shortly after the signing of a cease-fire agreement between France and Vietnam and is one of his earliest images using color photography."
