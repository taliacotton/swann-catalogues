FOOTNOTE: "From the Personal Collection of Aron M. Mathieu (1907-1996), founder of <i>Modern Photography</i> magazine.\n\nA vintage print by the great photojournalist made while on assignment in Switzerland. Eisenstaedt made some significant images during this 1932 trip, including the iconic shot of the skating waiter. Although several images from St. Moritz were reprinted by Eisensteadt in the late 1970s, this negative was never, or rarely, revisited. This warm, vintage photograph has been in the same collection since the 1940s. The sweet image of a young boy checking his reflection embodies Eisenstaedt's humanist, compassionate eye, and offers a range of beautiful tones and textures.\n\n<i>Eisenstaedt: Remembrances</i> (Little Brown & Co.), p. 17; <i>Eisenstaedt on Eisenstaedt</i> (Abbeville Press), p. 35."
