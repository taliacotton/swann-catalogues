FOOTNOTE: "Working at the prismatic intersection of art and science, Wilson Bentley became the first person to photograph a single snow crystal in 1885 by adapting a microscope to a bellows camera. Capturing over 5,000 images of delicately-rendered \"ice flowers\" in his lifetime, Bentley discovered the now commonly-known fact that no two snowflakes are the same. (He was also the first American to measure raindrops.)\n\nDeeply committed to his work, Bentley wrote, \"Under the microscope I found that snowflakes were miracles of beauty; and it seemed a shame that this beauty should not be seen and appreciated by others. Each crystal was a masterpiece of design; and no one design was ever repeated [...] I became possessed with a great desire to show people something of this wonderful loveliness, and ambition to become, in some measure, its preserver.\""
