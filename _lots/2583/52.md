FOOTNOTE: "Though the cyanotype process was invented in 1842 by Sir John Herschel, the height of is usage occurred around the turn of the 20th century. A printing-out process, the negative (or object) would be placed in contact with a sensitized sheet and exposed to daylight, creating a rich Prussian Blue in the exposed areas. This straightforward process was adopted by industrial photographers, which may relate to the cyanotype's usage as a reproduction process for technical drawings or illustrations by architects and engineers. This group of cyanotypes depicts various delivery and freight vehicles. Likely taken for automotive companies to exemplify their vehicles, the richly toned prints emphasize the characteristics of the automobiles as well as their signage."
