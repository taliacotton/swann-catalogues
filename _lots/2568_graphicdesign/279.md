TYPESET: Italian designer Munari was a true modern Renaissance Man - known as a visual
  artist, inventor, industrial and graphic designer, who also contributed to literature,
  poetry and theories of learning. His artwork was displayed in many Futurist exhibitions,
  and he associated with the Futurist movements until distancing himself after World
  War II. Munari also found himself working on children’s books, and like Depero,
  toy design. Later, in 1959, he designed the layout of this folded invitation (printed
  in Italian and French) from the International Committee of Honor on the occasion
  of the founding of the Depero Museum in Rovereto; it displays text of concrete Poet
  & Futurist Carl Bellioli. It is the only Futurist museum in Italy and was founded
  by the artist himself.
