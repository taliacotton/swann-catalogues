TYPESET: Cardinaux studied painting with Franz von Stuck in Germany, and also worked
  in Paris before returning to Switzerland where he became one of the founding fathers
  of Swiss poster art. In 1908, his poster for Zermatt with its flat colors and broad
  outlining was a revolution in the Swiss graphic art world. This fauvist image of
  a yellow horseman astride a green horse, promoting a Swiss Exhibition, proved to
  be scandalous; it took a patriotic subject and treated it with such unrealistic
  color that the normally passive Swiss surprised everyone by rallying against it.
