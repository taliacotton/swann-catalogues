at-a-glance: 8Â¼x11 inches, 21x28 cm. General Electric Company, New York.
TYPESET: A fabulous and startling piece of Modernist design, this booklet was commissioned
  from Herbert Bayer by Leo Lionni, the art director of N.W. Ayers at the time. Filled
  with powerful photomontages, color illustrations, dynamic layout and diagrams, the
  imagery here combines with the text to form a sort of science fiction narrative
  applied to the real world. Within its pages, the electron is explained and FM radio
  is promoted, as well as the nascent technology for television. The use of electricity
  to aid in public safety, agriculture and medicine is also illustrated. MoMA 561.1999.
FOOTNOTE: 'Condition A-: minor abrasions and creasing to covers; original stapled
  illustrated wrappers designed by Bayer.'
