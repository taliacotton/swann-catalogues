TYPESET: '"The effect of movement is made by shifting a typeset image on film horizontally
  and adjusting its focus. As lithography (offset) began to replace letterpress printing
  in the 1960s, phototypesetting - which by its nature suited the preparation of film
  for platemaking - began to compete with metal compositon" (Swiss Graphic Design,
