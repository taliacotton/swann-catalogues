TYPESET: "<p>Erwin Puchinger was a Viennese artist, who was an influential participant
  in the Austrian Jugendstil and Gesamtkunstwerk circles. Both of these movements
  worked to meld fine art traditions with applied art and to standardize their tenets
  of design. Puchinger worked in London, Prague and Paris as well as Vienna. Classical
  Greek &amp; Roman art and architecture, which were studied by his peers, also impacted
  Puchinger's aesthetic and is very much apparent in this poster for the Vienna Arts
  and Crafts Association.</p>"
