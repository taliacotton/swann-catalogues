TYPESET: "Sironi was a painter and an early member of the Futurist movement in the years before World War I. After the war, he was one of the founders of the Novecento Italiano movement and began supporting Mussolini. He contributed hundreds of illustrations to and designed covers for the Fascist newspapers <i>Il Popolo d'Italia<i> and <i>La Rivista Illustrata del Popola d'Italia</i>. He also designed pavilions for exhibitions and numerous posters, both political and commercial (including Fiat). He eventually abandoned easel painting in favor of communicating via \"a fusion of decoration and architecture exemplified by Gothic cathedrals. He felt that the mural was the proper basis of a popular national art\" (Il Castello). Manifesti Italiani p. 131."
