TYPESET: "Swiss Graphic Designer Monguzzi studied in Geneva and London before launching his career with Studio Boggeri in Milan in 1961. He later moved to Montreal to design nine pavilions for the 1967 International and Universal Exposition, then settled back in Switzerland to continue designing and curating. The Museo Cantonale d'Arte, founded in 1987, commissioned Monguzzi to devise the institution's logo as well as posters for each exhibition and program. This poster for an exhibition on Oskar Schlemmer's stage sets and costumes for Stravinsky's <i>Les Noces</i>, highlights his aptitude in creating dynamic typographic compositions. It also bears an uncanny resemblance to the famous letterform work by Strzeminski, <i>Z Ponad</i>."
