TYPESET: A landmark work for the Russian avant-garde movement, <i>"For the Voice”</i>
  represents an important period in the development of Constructivist design by Lissitzky.
  The title, “Dlia Golosa” derives from Russian Futurist Mayakovsky's 13 poems, which
  were meant to be read aloud. His innovative graphic design and typography are displayed
  in full force in this small book of 25 letterpress illustrations. "Lissitzky's invention
  of a thumb-tab index for ease in finding each poem epitomizes the notion of the
  book as functional object." Witovsky 37, MoMA 280.2001.1-25.
