TYPESET: "For an exhibition of \"Construction and Housing,\" Andersen shows us just that - a superb, architectural rendition of a room seen via a cut-away view. The artist's familiarity with the Avant-Garde movements of Europe is clearly on display, both in the near-Bauhausian backdrop of a black and white cityscape and in the tribute to De Stijl in the primary colors of the buildings and sky.  Danish 72."
