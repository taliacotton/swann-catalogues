TYPESET: "An absolute masterpiece of modern graphic design, Hohlwein referred to this poster as \"The man with the saddle.\" The use of a subdued background serves to delineate the overall image from the checkered riding pants and scarlet waistcoat that Hohlwein constructed in a cut-out fashion, inventing a revolutionary style of illustration in the process. This image was so striking that it became an emblem of the company, which used it on catalogue covers and even on their clothing labels. When the German design magazine <i>Gebrauchsgraphik</i> dedicated an entire issue to Hohlwein, the artist drew a modernized version of the image, which shows just how important it was to Hohlwein himself.
