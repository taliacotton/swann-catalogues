TYPESET: "A prolific poster designer based in Basel, Bühler worked for many of the most recognizable firms, such as P.K.Z., Union, Nivea and Roger & Gallet, a French perfume company, founded in 1862. They became famous for their luxurious bath soaps and their innovative recipe for violet-scented perfume, Vera Violetta. As seen in this poster, as well as in a design by Brun, Roger & Gallet also produced lipstick in gold metallic cases during the 1940s. A smaller version of this Bühler image exists, with a fuschia glove, printed by Atar in Geneva. Bühler's experiences designing in Paris and Berlin, in addition to Basel, explain his melding of sophisticated and focused advertising and the Object Poster. Swiss Poster Art 47.12, Margadant 343."
