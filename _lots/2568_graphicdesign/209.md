at-a-glance: 27x18¼ inches, 68½x46¼ cm. Adolf Simmel, Berlin.
TYPESET: A painter and a poster designer, Schulpig was very active in Berlin. In 1905,
  when Lucian Bernhard invented the Object Poster, with his seminal image for <i>Priester</i>
  matches, he could not have foreseen how much his new style would influence an entire
  generation of poster artists. Bernhard's poster for Steinway & Sons, in 1910 (see
  Swann Sale 2099, Lot 103), was a pure manifestation of this new style; a flat representation
  of the object, huge lettering and a monochromatic background. Schulpig's cleanly-executed
  image can certainly be considered a "tribute" to Bernhard, neatly recreating the
  feeling of the poster, albeit with slightly more detail to the piano and more text.
  Schulpig was not the only artist to find "inspiration" in Bernhard's piano imagery,
  as Julius Gipkens borrowed liberally from the style for his poster for <i>Pianos
  Steck</i> (see DFP-III 1044). Not in DFP, Muller-Brockman 131.
