DESCRIPT: ERIK NITSCHE (1908-1998)
CROSSHEAD: USS NAUTILUS / GENERAL DYNAMICS. 1955.
at-a-glance: 50x35¼ inches, 127x89½ cm. R. Marsens, Lausanne.
TYPESET: Perhaps the most famous image in Nitsche's General Dynamics series, this
  depicts the <i>USS Nautilus</i>, one of the country's first nuclear powered submarines.
  "It was an indelible logo in its day. Set against a gradated gray background, the
  shell was a virtual cornucopia of progress. The submarine was not seen as a killing
  machine, but rather the offspring of progress poised to help the world" (https://www.typotheque.com/articles/erik_nitsche_the_reluctant_modernist).
  It should be noted that the ongoing project to construct the <i>Nautilus</i> was
  so top secret that Nitsche was only provided a basic idea of what the submarine
  would ultimately look like. This is the French language poster from the initial
  <i>Atoms for Peace</i> series. Dynamic America p. 349, Encyclopedie de l'Affiche
  p. 104, Modern American 83, Margadant 228, MoMA 221.1956 (var).
