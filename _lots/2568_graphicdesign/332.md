TYPESET: <p>"The first series of six posters established a tone for all future General
  Dynamics graphics, as well as a paradigm, of sorts, for how the marriage of science
  and engineering would be visualized by kindred companies. Indeed Nitsche's brand
  of artful futurism was copied by many others at the time and might be seen today
  as representative of the so-called 'Atomic Style' that emerged in the mid- to late-1950s"
