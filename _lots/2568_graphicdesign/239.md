TYPESET: Dr. Fritz Kahn was an Orthodox Jewish gynecologist in Berlin, who published
  popular illustrated books including <i>The Cell</i> and <i>The Jews as a Race and
  Cultural People</i>. In his books and articles, he "visualized the structure and
  function of the human body in a very unique way." (http://www.fritz-kahn.com). This
  poster of <i>The Human as Industrial Palace</i> is exemplary of one of his conceptual
  designs, presenting a playful but instructive comparison between industrialism and
  anatomy, and elevating the traditional medical diagram into 20th century graphic
  design. When the Nazis took power, Kahn's books were banned and publicly burned,
  and Kahn left Germany for Palestine and then the U.S., with the help of his friend
  Albert Einstein. While some of his works were translated into English, without the
  resources to produce new books, Kahn fell into obscurity. His innovative designs
  were still influential to future artists, and the first exhibition of his works,
  <i>Fritz Kahn - Maschine Mensch</i>, opened in Berlin in 2010 and featured this
  mechanical image.Includes the full poster, a second smaller poster, five bound volumes
  of <i>Das Leben des Menschen”</i> (The Life of Man, 1922-1931), additional foldouts
  & two pairs of 3D glasses. Images available upon request.
