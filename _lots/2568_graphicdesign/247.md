DESCRIPT: HERBERT BAYER (1900-1985)
CROSSHEAD: UNIVERSAL TYPE / BREIT HALBFETT. Ink and gouache maquette. Circa 1925.
at-a-glance: 9¼x12½ inches, 23½x31¾ cm.
TYPESET: '"In 1925, [Walter] Gropius commissioned Bayer to design a typeface for all
  Bauhaus communications . . . He used his approach to modern typography to create
  an ''idealist typeface” (Designhistory.org). This hand-drawn and notated maquette
  appears to be the exact template used for the <i>Universal Type</i> image published
  in MoMA’s 1938 exhibition catalogue <i>Bauhaus 1919-1928</i>. The typeface displayed
  is captioned as “Universal type, characters at base show bold, medium and light
  weights, 1925. Improved 1928.”The rendering of this typeface (with the same spacing
  and formatting as this maquette) was also reprinted in <i>PM Magazine</i>, Vol.
  6, No. 2, December 1939, an issue that was designed by and featuring Bayer. In the
  article about <i>Universal Type</i>, Bayer details his requirements for a new alphabet,
  including the “geometric foundation of each letter,” avoidance of hand-written elements,
  like up and down strokes, and varying thickness, and simplification of forms to
  the most basic. "Banishing diagonals wherever possible, he constructed characters
  such as "k" and "x" with circular segments in place of the expected angles" (Modernity
  p. 200). Perhaps most noticeable in this new alphabet, is the absence of capitalized
  letters. Two other ink and guache maquettes for Univeral lettering are in the collections
  of the Harvard Art Museum (Modernity p. 201).'
FOOTNOTE: 'Condition A-: ink, pencil and correction fluid on paper, affixed to artist

  as well as typewriter text insert at bottom; small holes in corners of board for
  hanging; dated 1925 on verso; hinged to mat. Matted and framed.'
