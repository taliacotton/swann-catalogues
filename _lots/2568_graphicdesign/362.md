  in Paris, but conceived by Massimo and Lella Vignelli and Knoll associates in New
  York" (Knoll.com). The need for an innovative approach to exhibition layout in a
  challenging architectural space (the Pavillion de Marsan) resulted in the "Plexicube,"
  their main mode of display for the show. All of the Knoll designs were enclosed
  in these 8-foot hight glass boxes. This is the smaller version.
