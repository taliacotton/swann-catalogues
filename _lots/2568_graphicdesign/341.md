TYPESET: Hofmann's design for an open-air ballet performance was "one of the defining
  images of Swiss graphic design. . . The brilliant white of the lettering is a foil
  to the half-tone greys of the photograph; the dance, cut off at head and foot, is
  transformed into a graphic sign of movement rather than a three-dimensional pictorial
  image (Swiss Graphic Design, p. 216). MoMA 380.1963, Avant Garde p. 91, Swiss Graphic
  Design p. 216, Swiss Poster Art 59.13, Margadant 117.
