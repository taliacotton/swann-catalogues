DESCRIPT: JAN TSCHICHOLD (1903-1974)
CROSSHEAD: DER BERUFSPHOTOGRAPH. 1938.
at-a-glance: 25¼x35½ inches, 64x90 cm. Benno Schwabe & Co., Basel.
TYPESET: 'A prolific practitioner, teacher and writer, Tschichold was one of the fathers
  of "New Typography," the title of his highly influential 1928 book. Son of a calligrapher,
  and a student at the Academy for Graphic Arts in Leipzig, Tschichold was influenced
  by both the Bauhaus and Russian Constructivists like El Lissitzky. He moved to Munich
  in 1926 and continued teaching and designing until intense pressure from the Nazi
  party forced him to flee to Switzerland. He eventually moved to England, where he
  was responsible for a complete redesign of Penguin Books. This poster for The Professional
  Photographer exhibition in Basel uses an underlying geometric structure based on
  a neat grid of vertical and horizontal lines to convey information in a clean and
  organized manner. The use of a photographic negative arouses curiosity and creates
  an eye-catching image, while also alluding to the technical aspects of photography.
  "Many graphic designers mastered the camera alongside the tools of illustration,
  layout and lettering . . . Tschichold''s letterpress poster features precisely articulated
  elements that punctuate the page: the mechanical bite of the press is felt in the
  design. Tiny letters pierce the surface like tight black stitches while the larger
  headline contains a rainbow of colors printed with a single pass of the press" (Mechanical
  Age p. 76). Modern Poster 128, Mechanical Age p. 74, Berman / Juan March p. 146,
