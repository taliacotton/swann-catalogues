at-a-glance: Each approximately 10x7 inches, 25½x17¾ cm. Druzstevni Prace, Prague.
TYPESET: A complete two-year run of this lifestyle magazine. Among the artists whose
  work is featured, both written and visual, are Josef Sudek, Jaromir Funke, Alexander
  Hackenschmied, Karel Teige, Vladimir Krejcar, Le Corbusier, Man Ray, Max Ernst and
  Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. Sutnar, as Artistic Director of <i>Druzstevni Prace</i>, was
  responsible for the artistic design of this magazine, the covers of which are all
  like mini posters. Following Karel Teige's belief that "the cover was an advertisement
  for the book . . . and to make this desirable poster-like balance as strong an impact
  as possible [the artist must choose] primary colors and geometric shapes," Sutnar
  added his own elements of photomontage and typography to Teige's concept of cover
  design (Oxford, p. 59). His aesthetic helped to further promote Functionalist design
  into mainstream society. These issues frequently appear bound together; it is <i>rare</i>
  to find them loose, as issued. Berman / Juan March p. 144, Page Design p. 189, Modernism
  p. 274, Witkovsky pl. 42, Sutnar p. 64. Images available upon request.
