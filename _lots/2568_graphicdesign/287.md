TYPESET: "This striking design is a prime example of the impressive creativity and Modernism at De Valerio's fingertips. The image is constructed along a diagonal and the sophisticated and stylized typography is compellingly arranged to run parallel and perpendicular to the main image. At the center is the ingenious usage of train carriages and boats to help visualize the six services per day that ran between London and Paris. With its near geometric symmetry, pictographic elements and sublime use of typography and imagery, it is a brilliantly executed and rare poster. MoMA 868.1979."
