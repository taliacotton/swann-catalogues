Deeply inspired by Surrealist painting, their work often played with words and images. They had an active and successful partnership designing propaganda posters during the war, and in the post-war years working on large campaigns for American Overseas Airways, the General Post Office, the London Underground and others. The two designers parted ways in 1954."
