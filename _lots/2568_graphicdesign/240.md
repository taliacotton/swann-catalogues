TYPESET: Molzahn was a painter, printmaker, graphic designer, theorist and teacher.
  Although he was never officially a member of the Bauhaus, his work did appear in
  the group's third portfolio. In 1928, his seminal essay, "Stop Reading, Look!" hailed
  photography as the powerful new universal medium that would become a liberating
  means of communication. In 1929, he designed this and one other poster for an architectural
  and design exhibition in Breslau, <i>Dwelling and Workplace</i>. It is a tour-de-force
  of photomontage, typography and composition, in which all the elements of design
  and construction are represented. In 1938, Molzahn left Germany for America (seven
  of his artworks had been put on display in 1937 at the German Degenerate Art Exhibition).
  He taught at Moholy-Nagy's School of Design in Chicago from 1943-1947 and returned
  to live in Germany in 1959. Rademacher p. 240, Modern Poster 106, Modernism 127,
