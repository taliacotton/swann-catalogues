DESCRIPT: WALTER DEXEL (1890-1973)
CROSSHEAD: VERWENDE STETS NUR GAS. 1924.
at-a-glance: 19x25 inches, 48¼x63½ cm.
TYPESET: A painter, typographer, graphic designer and teacher, Dexel was appointed
  as the director of the Art Union in Jena, a central German university town. Closely
  associated with the Bauhaus, he became one of the most prominent practitioners of
  Constructivism. Here, promoting the use of gas ["Always use gas for cooking, baking,
  heating, lighting / because it is practical, clean, inexpensive / Saves work, time,
  money,"] one sees the confluence of art and commerce, wherein the most mundane of
  advertisements can be presented in an elevated manner. Dexel's strict Constructivist
  style "used exclusively typography and abstract geometrical markers" (Avant Garde
  p. 64). He eschewed pictorial imagery for the "the use of ornament based entirely
  on the precise geometric forms of the rectangle and the circle, and the almost exclusive
  use of a geometrically based sans-serif type" (Word & Image p. 56). Dexel p. 56,
