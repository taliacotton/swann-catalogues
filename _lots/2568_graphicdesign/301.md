at-a-glance: 19½x24¼ inches, 49½x61½ cm.
TYPESET: Clifford and Rosemary Ellis married in 1931 and worked together for the rest
  of their careers. It is hard to describe their unique style, which has the colorful
  and fanciful qualities of children's illustration, yet is also compelling, eye-catching
  and charmingly composed. Their aesthetic certainly appealed to a large swath of
  the general public, as the duo was commissioned to design posters for the London
  Underground, Shell, the General Post Office (GPO) and the Empire Marketing Board.
  This poster was commissioned by the GPO Film Unit to advertise "Cable Ship," a 12
  minute documentary on the repair of an International Telephone Exchange submarine
  cable that had been damaged. The 1933 film was grouped with 4 other short films,
  all centering on Post Office activities and repair work, and released in 1935 to
  considerable cinematic success. After the war, the artists primarily focused on
  book cover design.
