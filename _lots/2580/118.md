FOOTNOTE: 'The Pennsylvania Herald and General Advertiser was founded by the important
  magazine and atlas publisher Mathew Carey of American Museum fame, and was taken
  over starting with the 3 February 1787 issue by William Spotswood. Spotswood''s
  editor was Alexander Dallas, later a cabinet member in the Madison administration.
  <br><br>The great subject of national interest covered in this volume was the Constitutional
  Convention which ran in Philadelphia from May to September 1787. The 30 May issue
  reports that the convention''s delegates have named George Washington as their leader,
  and added "the decisive effect it must have upon the peace and prosperity of America,
  though everything should certainly be given to prudence and deliberation, not a
  moment can be spared to useless forms or unprofitable controversy." Editor Dallas
  apparently had a source from within the rather secretive proceedings. In reply to
  rumors that the convention was setting up a new monarchy, his source explained that
  "tho we cannot, affirmatively, tell you what we are doing; we can, negatively, tell
  you what we are not doing--we never once thought of a king" (18 August 1787). On
  8 September: "We hear that the Convention propose to adjourn next week, after laying
  America under such obligations to them for their long, painful and disinterested
  labours, to establish her liberty upon a permanent basis, as no time will ever cancel."
  On 18 September they reported that "the federal convention, after having concluded
  the important and difficult task of framing a federal system of government, broke
  up; and many of the delegates, we are informed, are already on their way to communicate
  to their anxious constituents the result of their deliberations. . . . We trust
  every friend to the peace and prosperity of America, is prepared to receive with
  respect, and to consider with candour, the propositions which will then be divulged."
  The Pennsylvania delegates were of course able to present the results to their home
  legislature more swiftly than those from other states, and thus the Constitution
  was first unveiled to a larger audience in the Pennsylvania General Assembly on
  18 September at 11 a.m.<br><br>The 20 September 1787 issue prints the Constitution
  in full, as it was presented to the states for ratification (the text had first
  appeared in five Philadelphia daily newspapers the previous day). Benjamin Franklin,
  one of the delegates and also the sitting President of Pennsylvania, introduced
  the new creation to the assembly: "We have now the honor to present to this house
  the plan of government for the United States. . . . We sincerely hope and believe
  that the result . . . will tend to promote the happiness and prosperity of this
  commonwealth in particular, and of the United States in general." Pennsylvania''s
  debates over ratification fill the October through December 1787 issues. <br><br>This
  volume is full of interest even behind the momentous launch of the Constitution.
  The culmination of Shays'' Rebellion is covered in the first months of this volume.
  Benjamin Franklin, as president of the state, appears frequently in these pages.
  His proclamation on the apprehension of the Shays'' Rebellion rebels, signed in
  type with the state seal, appears in the 17 March 1787 issue. The ordinance creating
  the Northwest Territory is printed in full in the 25 July 1787 issue. A long article
  on the Montgolfier balloon ascensions spans the 20 and 24 October 1787 issues. Discussion
  of the abolition of the slave trade is interspersed with advertisements for runaway
  slaves. <br><br>Per the Library of Congress, the last known issue of the Herald
  was issued just two weeks after this run ends, on 14 February 1788. Most of these
  Herald issues are marked in the upper margin for original subscriber "J. Bloomfield
  Esq.," very likely New Jersey Attorney General Joseph Bloomfield (1753-1823), who
  later served as the state''s governor. <br><br>The rear of the volume contains issues
  of Dunlap''s American Daily Advertiser from June to December 1791. A black-bordered
  obituary of patriot-printer William Bradford appears in the 28 September 1791 issue;
  President Washington''s State of the Union address appears in the 26 October 1791
  issue. '
