CROSSHEAD: Pair of documents of Texas officer A.J. Toutant, signed by General Cooper

at-a-glance: Various places, 1863-64
TYPESET: 2 items, as described.
FOOTNOTE: 'Alcée J. Toutant (1836-1905) settled in San Antonio, TX as a young man,
  began the Civil War with a Texas regiment, and later became an aide-de-camp to Mansfield
  Lovell, the disgraced major general who had surrendered Louisiana and spent the
  rest of the war without a command. He finished the war as aide-de-camp to his famous
  uncle, General Beauregard--more properly, Pierre Gustave Toutant-Beauregard. Alcée''s
  obituary reported that "Much of the strategy displayed by General Beauregard was
  the outgrowth of conferences between himself with his nephew." <br><br>The earlier
  of these two documents is Lieutenant Toutant''s letter to Confederate General Samuel
  Cooper (1798-1876), asking whether he was entitled to cavalry pay as an aide-de-camp.
  Though Cooper played mainly an administrative role as Adjutant and Inspector General,
  he was technically the top-ranking general in the army, senior to Lee, Beauregard
  and the rest. Cooper inscribed and signed his response in the docketing on verso:
  "All aides de camp are entitled to cavalry pay as lieutenants. June 23/63, S Cooper,
  A & I G." One page, 9¾ x 7¾ inches, plus integral blank with docketing; minimal
  wear. Richmond, VA, 23 June 1863. <br><br>The other document is a pass issued to
  Toutant, signed by his famous uncle and commander, reading "Pass Capt. A.J. Toutant
  A.D.C. on his way to Shreveport & San Antonio & back. G.T. Beauregard, General."
  Beauregard was at that point in command of defending against Sherman''s March to
  the Sea, which by then had nearly reached Savannah--an odd time to send his aide
  on leave to Texas. One page, 6¼ x 8 inches; separations at folds at margins of signature,
  skillfully backed with tissue. Montgomery, AL, 2 December 1864. '
