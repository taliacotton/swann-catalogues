CROSSHEAD: "Issue of the Natchitoches Union Daily printed on wallpaper."
at-a-glance: "Natchitoches, LA, 2 April 1864"
TYPESET: "2 pages, 19¾ x 11¾ inches, printed on verso of one large sheet of wallpaper in a pattern of crimson, brown and blue panels; moderate dampstaining, wear and short separations at folds, some sections printed a bit faintly; early pencil signature of Mrs. G.D. Bennett on wallpaper."
FOOTNOTE: "The Union forces took Natchitoches on 1 April, and immediately began publishing a daily newspaper despite the lack of newsprint. This wallpaper copy prints their endorsement of the Lincoln-Johnson ticket, illustrated by a flag. Another article offers a long mocking farewell to the paper's former editor. Many of the articles are intended to convince the populace of the Union's good intentions and lawful governance. A local man announces: \"I am in the United States Army, and I don't care who knows it; I am inclined to think the secessionists will have a hard time of hanging me now.\" After a description of conscripts maltreated or killed by the Confederates, the editor conclude \"To all such enslaved white men, we offer you in the name of the President, pardon and protection.\" "
