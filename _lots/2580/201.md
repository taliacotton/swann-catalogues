FOOTNOTE: "These documents trace the history of a silver set. The Rev. John Jekyll (1739-1777) had been raised in Boston, where his father had been a customs collector. In 1769 he began serving as Vicar of Evercreech back in England. For some reason his family silver was entrusted to a second cousin, Charles Willing (1738-1788)--their mothers were first cousins from the Shippen family. Willing then passed the silver to his brother-in-law Samuel Powel (1738-1793) and his wife Elizabeth Willing Powel (1742-1830). Samuel served as mayor of Philadelphia, and Elizabeth was a confidante of George Washington and other patriot leaders. Upon Elizabeth's death in 1830, the silver was handed over to Charles Willing's grandson, Thomas Willing Morris (1792-1852). <br><br>Offered here are two memoranda signed by the famed socialite Elizabeth Willing Powel, listing the silver and explaining its history, in 1798 (quite worn and stained) and 1821 (a much cleaner version). Also included is an 1830 formal estate appraisal of the silver upon her death; and a receipt signed by Thomas Willing Morris upon taking possession of the silver. "
