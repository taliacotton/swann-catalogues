at-a-glance: "Before Vicksburg, MS, 21 March 1863"
TYPESET: "Manuscript letter, signed for Grant by Assistant Adjutant General John A. Rawlins, to Major General James B. McPherson as commander of XVII Corps.  One page, 9¾ x 7¾ inches; folds, minimal wear, lacking integral blank leaf."
FOOTNOTE: "The Siege of Vicksburg began with a failed Union assault on 19 March 1863. This order was issued as Union commander Grant prepared for a second assault on 22 March: \"You will please move one division of your corps to Eagle Bend, on the east bank of the Mississippi River, where General Grant's division landed, with a view to re-inforcing Major General Sherman from that point. Let there be no delay. Send them by brigades as rapidly as they can be embarked.\" <br><br>The battle maps show that one division of McPherson's corps was indeed moved rightward to Sherman's XV Corps in time for the 22 May assault. Brigadier General James A. Tuttle's division played a significant role in the battle under Sherman. As the repeated assaults against the formidable Confederate fortifications drew to a close, Sherman would order Tuttle: \"This is murder; order those troops back.\" "
