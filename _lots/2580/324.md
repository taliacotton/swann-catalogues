FOOTNOTE: "This unusually large broadside bears a similar header to most Inquisition broadsides: \"Nos los Inquisidores Apostolicos contra la heretica pravedad y apostasía.\" It features three annotated lists of books: those prohibited even for those with licenses (\"prohibidos aun para los que tienen licencia\"), those prohibited in full (\"prohobidos in totum\"), and those which required censorship (\"Libros mandados expurgar\"). A total of 74 books are listed, most in Spanish but many of them in French, each with a short summary of their scandalous nature--\"obra seductiva, fautora del tolerantismo,\" \"impías y antisociales,\" \"lasciva y obscena,\" \"contener doctrinas heréteicas, revolucionarias y antimonárquicas,\" and more. Among the forbidden books are a 1764 French translation of Locke. Not in Medina, Mexico; 4 in OCLC, and none traced at auction. "
