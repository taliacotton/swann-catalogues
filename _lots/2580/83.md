FOOTNOTE: 'On 2 November 1861, President Lincoln removed John Frémont as commander
  of the Department of the West, leaving the Missouri campaign in the hands of little-known
  Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant, a West Point graduate. Reporting to Grant although
  bearing the same rank was Brigadier General John McClernand, a political appointee
  and old friend of Lincoln''s from Illinois. Five days later, Grant led his two brigades
  on a surprise attack on a small Confederate base in Belmont, MO, across the river
  from a larger base in Columbus, KY. The Confederate camp was routed and destroyed,
  but reinforcements soon arrived to rout Grant''s forces in turn; Grant himself barely
  made it back aboard the transport ship. <br><br>Offered here is McClernand''s official
  report to Grant on the battle, written five days later. The two generals barely
  knew each other at this point, but grew to be bitter enemies as the war progressed.
  Here, McClernand does his best to ingratiate himself with Grant. Describing the
  bravery of his troops early in the battle, McClernand notes that "this gallant conduct
  was stimulated by your presence and inspired by your example. Here your horse was
  shot under you." McClernand also describes the death of his Polish-American aide-de-camp,
  Captain Alexander Bielaski. <br><br>Below the printed text on the final page, an
  unknown reader pokes fun at McClernand''s self-promotion and egotism through a simple
  word count in manuscript: "Principal characters. The personal pronoun I, 34 times;
  the possessive My, 27 times . . . Me, 6 times." <br><br>One other copy of this report
  traced in OCLC, at the Chicago History Center; none found at auction. '
