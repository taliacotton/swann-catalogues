FOOTNOTE: 'If you have arrived at Swann''s Americana catalog in search of Civil War
  diaries and Declaration of Independence broadsides, this next lot will probably
  not be for you. <br><br>Stuart Alan Horn (1946-2008), a Philadelphia artist and
  musician, was a prominent member of the mail art scene--an insular world of like-minded
  outsiders who exchanged Xeroxes of enigmatic collages. Some of his creations were
  distributed under the name Northwest Mounted Valise, including a 1975 book of the
  same name (included). Offered here is a large archive of his original maquettes,
  reproductions, correspondence, mail art received from his associates, and more.
  At the core are approximately 60 maquettes of varying degrees of complexity, along
  with a larger number of photocopied reproductions, and other material that was apparently
  intended for use in collage. <br><br>The small correspondence file includes a 1973
  fan letter from reality show pioneer and gay icon Lance Loud; and 3 letters dated
  1974-1975 from Baltimore actress Edith Massey (a John Waters regular best known
  as "Edie the Egg Lady" from Pink Flamingos). In her 11 March 1975 letter she announces
  "The picture Female Trouble is going to open in Philadelphia next month if nothing
  happens." <br><br>Horn also led several bands on the Philadelphia avant-garde scene
  such as Stu Horn & His Invisible Band, and Horn & Hard Art. Included here are numerous
  show fliers (including some in maquette form), a folder of song lyrics, Horn & Hard
  Art''s 1978 album, and its original cover art. <br><br>In Horn''s mail art circle,
  work was not always signed or credited. The bulk of this archive is stylistically
  consistent and clearly his; also included are a smaller number of zines, newsletters,
  and mail art which come from other artists. Bill Griffith of "Zippy the Pinhead"
  fame makes 3 appearances with signed or stamped work. To provide a tenuous tie-in
  with Swann''s regular Americana fare, Griffith is the great-grandson and namesake
  of Western photographer William Henry Jackson (see lot 248). <br><br>A lengthy 2020
  reminiscence of Horn can be found on longreads.com, "Find Yourself: from way back
  in â€™80s Philadelphia, Elizabeth Isadora Gold remembers her first writing teacher,
  the mail art artist/lyricist Stu Horn." Horn also makes numerous appearances in
  the 1995 book "Eternal Network: A Mail Art Anthology," edited by Chuck Welch (included).
  Some of his work is held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Dartmouth College.
  <br><br>In short, we offer a box of his stuff. Some things can''t be explained.
  Stu Horn probably would not have wanted us to try. '
