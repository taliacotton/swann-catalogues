DESCRIPT: "(CIVIL WAR--CONFEDERATE.) Robert E. Lee."
CROSSHEAD: "Field printing of his farewell address, \"General Orders, No. 9.\""
at-a-glance: "Headquarters, Army of Northern Virginia, 10 April 1865"
TYPESET: "Letterpress circular, 8 x 5Â¼ inches, signed in type by Lee; worn at edges, uneven toning, uneven folds and wrinkling, light mildew and foxing."
FOOTNOTE: "Lee's eloquent \"General Orders No. 9\" was reprinted widely after the war in broadside and book form, and in postwar manuscript copies which Lee graciously signed, but original field printings like this are rarely seen. Paper and ink were in short supply for the defeated army, but those units which still had supplies and functioning field presses did their best to print the order for their regimental and company commanders--possibly as their last official act.
