FOOTNOTE: 'Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (1648-1695) was a Mexican nun at the San Jerónimo
  Convent who, against all odds, became a prolific and well-regarded poet. Her prominence
  as an intellectual began to bring her in conflict with the church leadership after
  1690. Two volumes of her collected works were published in 1689 and 1692 (a posthumous
  volume followed in 1700) which contain virtually all that remains of her writings.
  In 1693 and 1694, she ceased writing, was forced to sell her extensive book collection,
  publicly repented, and was restricted to charity work among the poor. In 1695, while
  tending to her fellow sisters during an epidemic, she became fatally ill. Her reputation
  has only grown over the centuries. She now ranks among the most enduring literary
  figures of colonial Mexico, and a proto-feminist icon. Offered here is a set of
  early editions of her collected works, as follows. <br><br>"Inundacion castalida
  de la unica poetisa, musa decima." Toning, minor edge wear, moderate dampstaining,
  dark stain in lower corner scarcely affecting text. First edition. Madrid: Juan
  Garcia Infanzon, 1689. <br><br>"Segundo tomo de las obras . . . segunda impression."
  Moderate foxing and toning, minor edge wear, lacking leaf S2 (pages 275-6). Second
  edition, after the 1692 first edition. Barcelona: Joseph Llopis, 1693. <br><br>"Fama,
  y obras posthumas, tomo tercero, del Fenix de Mexico, y decima musa, poetisa de
  la America." Early manuscript waste paper endpapers, two preliminary leaves transposed,
  minor foxing and toning, minor wear. Second edition, after the first edition of
