FOOTNOTE: 'This diary records a trip by rail through much of California. The author
  is a seasoned lone traveler from the northeast on an annual winter trip. He seems
  to be looking for a Californian paradise with one eye, and looking for an excuse
  to mock the Californian dream with the other. He is often critical of climate, hotel
  accommodations, and potential for agriculture, but seems to be enjoying his constant
  travels despite himself, and offers a high level of descriptive detail. His mode
  of operation was to stay for several days in a town and make long day trips by rail.
  The diary starts on the train passing through Ventura. His first base of operations
  is Santa Barbara, from where he visits the local mission, Montecito, Carpinteria
  (seeing the world''s largest grape vine), and drought-stricken Naples: "at one large
  ranch near Naples, four men are employed to go about the ranch and skin the cattle
  as fast as they starve and die." Next was a stop in Fresno: "I took a walk out to
  the Chinese quarter and found lots of the cusses" and then passed through the red
  light district: "I got service salutes from the girls, but paid no attention to
  them" (6 March). From there he headed toward the coast. At a layover in Tracy, "did
  not get any dinner at all as the place is a small one, and rum is the principal
  article there for sale. The hotels are no good." (circa 8 March). Pacific Grove
  was his next base of operations. The hotel in Pacific Grove "is kept by a Dutchman
  and is very skimpily run. The proprietor is more afraid of serving a sufficiency
  of grub than an ordinary man is of the smallpox" (13 March). From there he saw Monterey
  and Point Lobos.<br><br>A short stop near Los Angeles yielded descriptions of Pasadena
  ("do not think I saw any place that would please me as a home . . . a slow sort
  of place, nothing to do but talk orange") and Santa Monica. San Diego was next,
  "too new for a desirable place to live . . . It will be many years before San Diego
  will be a pleasant-looking place" (21 March). From there on 22 March 1898 he visits
  La Jolla and "Ramona House, an old tumble down adobe," which he mistakenly attributes
  as "the house of the hero of . . . Helen Hunt Jackson''s Indian story" (which is
  apparently the running theme of our fall Americana auction--see the next two lots),
  and then Tijuana across the border on the next day, where "the train is met by Reuben
  the guide (a Cleveland Negro) who runs some four horse stages from the depot to
  the village." San Bernardino was his next extended stop, where he marveled at the
  extent of the orange groves but after repeated sampling declared that the product
  does "not begin to compare in flavor with the Florida oranges" (29 March), reiterating
  the next day "these California oranges haven''t any business with Florida fruit."
  He visited Highland, Redlands, and Riverside, as well as the famed Squirrel Inn
  in the mountains, where he got lost in a snowstorm and nearly had to sleep outdoors.
  Finally he stayed briefly at Pomona and Los Angeles, from where he headed east on
  8 April. His only stop on the return journey was in Colorado Springs, and he arrived
  in New York on 18 April to conclude his diary. <br><br>Also included is a second
  diary of 17 pages, 5-26 October 1898, by the same author, on a camping trip in the
  north country to hunt partridges. References to Mud Pond and Chamberlain Lake suggest
  the Allagash Wilderness in northern Maine. 3 unused period postcards from towns
  described in the California diary are also included. <br><br>We''ve been unable
  to pin down the authorship of this interesting diary. It concludes with the initials
  G.G.G. A careful perusal of the hotel register reports in local newspapers on his
  arrival days shows two promising matches. The San Diego Union and Bee of 22 March
  1898 shows a G.G. Gunnell of Denver checking in at the Hotel Brewster, and the Daily
  Times-Index of San Bernardino of 28 March 1898 shows a G.G. Greenwell of Chicago
  checking in at the Stewart. Both of these are likely our man. Whether he enjoyed
  slightly disguising his name, or the newspapers exercised a sloppy transcription
  of the registers, we can find no appropriate Gunnells or Greenwells in the census
  records. '
