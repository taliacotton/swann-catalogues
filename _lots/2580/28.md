CROSSHEAD: The Battles of Lexington and Concord, after the famous engravings by Doolittle.
at-a-glance: No place, circa 1778
TYPESET: Set of 4 ink and watercolor drawings on laid paper, each about 15 x 18 inches;
  wear, closed tears, several small areas of loss, creases and wrinkling, pinholes
  in corners, skillfully stabilized and laid down on light modern board.
FOOTNOTE: 'These remarkable watercolors were created early in the Revolution by St.
  John Honeywood (1763-1798), then a boy of about 14 years old, who had twin obsessions
  with art and the patriot cause. He was raised in Leicester, MA, about 32 miles west
  of Concord. His father was a physician who had died at Ticonderoga in 1776, leaving
  him an orphan to be raised by his aunt in Leicester. He was soon sent off to study
  at Yale College in New Haven, CT, home town of the engraver Amos Doolittle. Honeywood
  may not have been able to readily afford Doolittle''s recently published views of
  the Battles of Lexington and Concord, but as an aspiring artist he may have secured
  access to them and made these copies for his own edification. He was known as an
  artist at Yale; his 1779 drawing of classmate George Welles was later engraved,
  and his 1780 pencil sketch was later used to illustrate the collected works of his
  college president and mentor Ezra Stiles. Honeywood graduated from Yale in 1782
  and became a successful lawyer and political figure in Salem, NY. A volume of his
  poems, which also alludes to his artistic endeavors, was published posthumously
  in 1801. <br><br>A similar set of Honeywood''s renditions of these prints, but in
  poor condition, was given to the Bangor Public Library in 1913. He signed one of
  those as "J. Honeywood pinx''t. AEtat 14," suggesting that it was drawn in 1777
  or 1778. They are discussed in Ian Quimby''s seminal article, "The Doolittle Engravings
  of the Battle of Lexington and Concord" (Winterthur Portfolio, 1968:4, page 96).
  Quimby describes the Bangor set: "Although crude, they possess a curious attention
  to detail and felicity in handling the human figure that is lacking in the Doolittle
  prints." The present set is different in many details, but similar in style and
  artistic quality, suggesting that it was done at approximately the same time. Oddly
  enough, the present drawings are each signed "J Honeywood, sculp," suggesting that
  Honeywood was the engraver rather than the artist--quite impossible for a group
  of original drawings. He was apparently imitating Doolittle''s "sculp" in the source
  images. <br><br>Plate I, "The Battle of Lexington, April 19, 1775," follows Doolittle''s
  original composition quite closely, and reproduces his title and caption text almost
  verbatim, although some of the patriots in the foreground to the left are here out
  of scale. This plate is the only one from Honeywood''s Bangor Library set which
  is reproduced in the Quimby article. In the Bangor example, Honeywood has compressed
  the composition to fit a nearly square sheet, but here he has retained the original
  proportions. <br><br>Plate II, "A View of the Town of Concord," is probably where
  Honeywood took the greatest liberties with his source material. His handling of
  perspective is not on par with Doolittle''s--the gravestones are shown here facing
  directly to the viewer in straight lines, and the windows in the building at left
  don''t quite line up. He has, however, added compelling detail to three of the gravestones,
  making them almost legible--a skull and crossed bones are clearly visible in the
  central stone. Honeywood''s handling of the figures in the foreground, Colonel Smith
  and Major Pitcairn, is much more realistic and detailed than Doolittle''s naive
  treatment. While it''s unlikely that Honeywood had any special knowledge of their
  appearances, he may have worked from models to present this pair as fully realized
  individuals. Quimby notes that in Honeywood''s depiction, "Colonel Smith is shown
  as the fat man we know him to have been, standing in a pose familiar from the conversation
  pieces of the day. This is in marked contrast with Doolittle''s treatment of the
  same figure, which is a mere caricature of a man." Major Pitcairn''s spyglass is
  here marked "London." <br><br>In Plate III, "The Engagement at the North Bridge
  in Concord," Honeywood makes no effort to replicate Doolittle''s treatment of the
  sky, and has reconfigured the farm field in the foreground. The essential details
  of the battle scene remain the same, though, with a row of British Regulars at the
  right of the bridge covering an orderly retreat by their comrades as the "Provincials"
  prepare to cross in pursuit. <br><br>Finally, the dramatic Plate IV is "A View of
  the South Part of Lexington," showing houses consumed by flames as the British destroyed
  supplies prior to their retreat. While the mismatched size of the British troops
  in the field cannot be blamed on Doolittle, Honeywood''s treatment of the patriots
  firing behind the stone wall in the foreground is probably an improvement.<br><br>Provenance:
