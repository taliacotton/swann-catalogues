FOOTNOTE: 'William Kilby (1763-1829) was a blacksmith in Dennysville, ME, a few miles
  from the coastal border with Canada--about as far east as Down East gets. The village
  was settled in 1786 by a group of 16 settlers from Hingham, MA; Kilby came up from
  Hingham to open his blacksmith shop the following year. He eventually held many
  official posts in the small town, including clerk, selectman, treasurer, and postmaster.
  <br><br>Lumber was the town''s main industry, and Kilby often made or repaired supplies
  for the town''s sawmill such as crowbars, chains, spikes, hooks, and more. He supplied
  picks and nails for a carding mill (page 207) which seemed to be a much smaller
  operation. For local farmers he supplied hoes, horse shoes, and plows. For the schoolhouse
  (page 95) he produced andirons, a fire shovel, and "an iron to ring bell." The town''s
  early leader Judge Theodore Lincoln (1763-1852), son of the Revolutionary War general
  Benjamin Lincoln, is featured on at least 10 pages. <br><br>Harvard''s Baker Library
  holds an earlier Kilby ledger, and the University of Maine holds the following one.
  Provenance: by descent from William Kilby to his great-great-grandson Keith Hobart
  Kilby (1907-1969) of Dennysville; gift to William A. Reily in 1937. '
