FOOTNOTE: "This broadside seeks the support of Civil War veterans for the Republican Party's slate of state and local candidates, by offering numerous examples of the Democratic Party's hostility to the war effort and sympathy for the Confederacy. One might think it was issued for the 1864 election, but it was issued by the Soldier's Friend, a veteran's paper which did not begin publication until after the war. It notes in the second column: \"Such is the record of the Democratic party up to the last day of the war.\" "
