FOOTNOTE: "These views depict the Whaling Disaster of 1871, in which a fleet of 40 whale ships north of the Bering Strait were caught by an unexpectedly early freeze in late August. 33 of them were trapped in the pack ice, with some of them crushed. In a remarkable show of solidarity, their entire crews were transferred by small whaleboats to the 7 ships which remained free of the ice. All 1219 men were saved, but the 33 ships were lost--a harsh blow to an already dying industry. One set in OCLC. "
