FOOTNOTE: "The original program for the presentation of the famed Wright Flyer at the Smithsonian. This brought to an end 45 years of feuding between the Wrights and the Smithsonian, which had for many years promoted the competing claims of Samuel Langley as the pioneer of flight. The program is illustrated with the classic 1903 photograph of the airplane in flight as well as portraits of Wilbur and Orville Wright, plus the laid-down photograph of the airplane as it appeared in its new exhibition space. Only one copy of this program is listed in OCLC--and that is held by the Smithsonian. "
