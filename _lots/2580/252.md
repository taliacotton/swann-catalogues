FOOTNOTE: 'James Calhoun (1845-1876) came from a wealthy Cincinnati family and joined
  the Union Army in 1864, becoming a career infantry officer. In January 1868 he went
  west with the 32nd Infantry to Fort Grant, Arizona; his regiment was consolidated
  into the 21st Infantry in August 1869. He later gained a most unfortunate fame as
  brother-in-law and comrade in arms to George Armstrong Custer at Little Bighorn.
  <br><br>Offered here is a narrative which Lieutenant Calhoun wrote while stationed
  at Fort Grant. It describes a scouting expedition which took place between February
  1869 (when Colonel John Green assumed control of the post) and August 1869 (when
  General Thomas Devin was transferred from the District of Arizona). A band of Apaches
  had driven off a herd of cattle near Tucson, and Calhoun was sent to accompany a
  detachment of 30 cavalry in pursuit up the San Pedro River. <br><br>This is not
  an official report. Apparently written and signed shortly after the expedition,
  it is filled with sarcasm and amusing narrative details. The expedition falls in
  with a band of 4 Mexican civilians who were also hunting the Apaches. Calhoun hints
  broadly that these Mexicans were actually doing their best to avoid a confrontation,
  lighting large fires at night to warn of their approach. A full day''s march from
  the camp, the expedition realized that nobody had thought to pack any provisions,
  forcing the men to live on whatever rations were in their packs. They continued
  up and over numerous mountains at great hazard to their horses, traveling by night
  when possible: "Walking at night over a ground covered with cactus and leading a
  horse who objects to being led are things that must be experienced to be appreciated."
  After 4 days they gave up the hunt and began a return to Fort Grant via the Aravaipa
  Canyon, "through which none of our party had ever been, and in fact but one party
  of white men ever had been through." The steep walls and slow progress made them
  vulnerable to ambush. At one point, with the Mexicans traveling ahead, the cavalrymen
  heard a barrage of gunfire. Rushing toward the fight, "as we rode up to them, the
  firing ceased for a moment, and someone informed us they were firing at a turkey.
  There they all commenced again and at last brought down a game old gobbler weighing
  about 25 pounds. There must have been two thousand shots fired at that unfortunate
  bird and he was only hit once." They returned safely to Fort Grant "and wondered
  if there was anything in the world more pleasant than a trip in the wild mountains
  of Arizona." <br><br>In January 1871, Calhoun was transferred to George Armstrong
  Custer''s famous 7th United States Cavalry. The following year he married his commander''s
  sister Margaret Custer, becoming one of several extended Custer family members in
  the regiment. At the Battle of the Little Bighorn, he was in temporary command of
  Company L, and died alongside the rest of his men atop what is now known as Calhoun
  Hill. '
