FOOTNOTE: 'A complete run of the original 12 volumes of this seminal American magazine.
  The negotiations over the United States Constitution are a central focus of the
  first 6 volumes. Most notable is a printing of the 17 September 1787 version in
  seven articles, printed in the September 1787 issue, pages 276-284. The Bill of
  Rights is printed in the second appendix of Volume VII. <br><br>The May 1789 issue
  contains the first American printing of the famous deck plan of the slave ship Brooks,
  titled "Plan of an African Ship''s Lower Deck, with Negroes in the Proportion of
  Not Quite One to a Ton," folding out to 5¼ x 16 inches. It was one of the most powerful
  images of the early anti-slavery movement. Appearing as the frontispiece of the
  March 1789 issue is an engraved map, "Chart of the Gulf Stream," folding out to
  8¾ x 9¾ inches, with some separation at folds but complete. The November 1789 issue
  features an engraving of a young enslaved child from Maryland who was born without
  arms. <br><br>Other highlights include the Federalist Papers, Nos. 1-6 as published
  in the November and December 1787 issues; and "Address of the Hebrew Congregation
  in Newport, Rhode-Island, to the President of the United States of America, August
  17, 1790" in an appendix to Volume IX, page 40. <br><br>This volume is a mixed edition.
  The first 11 volumes are each bound with a rarely seen 1798 collective title page,
  presumably issued to make the 12 volumes complete with the revived Volume XIII issued
  that year. However, each volume seems to consist of individual issues culled from
  Carey''s inventory--Volumes I through III being a mix of different editions, and
  the later volumes apparently made up of first-edition issues, with the occasional
  subscriber list or other preliminary omitted. The magazine contents are complete
  except for 7 missing leaves as noted. <br><br>This magazine is rarely seen in a
  complete run, as the great value of the slave ship engraving often causes it to
  be separated. '
