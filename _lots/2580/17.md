FOOTNOTE: "This photograph, likely posed, was copyrighted in the aftermath of the Wounded Knee Massacre. The subcaption reads \"Jack Redcloud brings the news of surrender and end of the war to his lady friends.\" On verso is a note reading \"Brought from the west by Col. N.W. Osborne U.S.A. circa 1877.\" That date precedes the copyright by many years, but Nathan Ward Osborne served as colonel of the 5th United States Infantry from 1888 until his death in 1895. "
