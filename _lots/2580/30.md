FOOTNOTE: "A British satirical print, depicting a comical battle taking place in the folds of a woman's fashionably enormous hair. The troops fight under the flags of a monkey and a duck, while a naval battle rages in her lower tresses. Matthew Darly was a popular London print-seller, while his wife Mary apparently did much of the engraving. The print was possibly taken from the 1776 book \"Darly's Comic-Prints of Characters, Caricatures, Macaronies, etc.\" \"Of inestimable interest and, so far as the writer knows, no copy has come to light in this country\"--P. Lee Phillips, \"A Rare Caricature of Bunker Hill,\" Daughters of the American Revolution Magazine 52:7 (July 1918), page 391-4. Cresswell 697; Dolmetsch, Rebellion and Reconciliation 37. "
