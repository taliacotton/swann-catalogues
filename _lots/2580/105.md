at-a-glance: No place, 1 October 1864

FOOTNOTE: '"There is something about a review that no person can describe. It is grand
  and sublime beyond description. We were reviewed by Major General Howard, and just
  as we had got through, General Billy Sherman appeared on the field, then we had
  to be reviewed by that noble hero. Our division was drawn up around the edge of
  a large field, and when Sherman rode out into the field to acknowledge our salute,
  feelings that I cannot describe completely overcame me. Cynthia, I for the first
  time in my life or nearly the first time, shed tears. Yes, I cried and could not
  help it. And then, when we marched past the old hero, I shed tears again. He sat
  there on his horse and as the colors were drooped to him, he raised his hat and
  acknowledged the salute. . . . There never was a better picture." <br><br>The author
  was very likely Henry Hampton Roberts (1836-1891) of Lovilia, Iowa, a sergeant in
  Company E of the 6th Iowa Infantry, whose wife was Cynthia Lodeska Rogers Roberts
  (1841-1922). He notes that the letter would be brought home via Calvin Barnard,
  a private in the same company, also from Lovilla, who was discharged in October
  1864 after the amputation of his arm. The regiment had been part of the recently
  concluded Atlanta campaign under Sherman, and would soon continue with him on the
  March to the Sea. '
