FOOTNOTE: "This was published by the Natchitoches Union, a bilingual French-English paper which came out from 1859 to 1864. Several issues of the newspaper were also printed on wallpaper or other \"necessity paper.\" This almanac makes no weather predictions, but serves as a calendar for the year 1864, with religious holidays, times for sunrise and sunset, and moon cycles notes. Text is in French including five of the seven advertisements, with the remaining two in English. <br><br>While wallpaper was sometimes used to print Confederate newspapers, and was also used for wrappers or endpapers, it is rarely seen used for broadsides. The only others noted in Parrish & Willingham are two entries for field-printed military orders (#1150 and 1567). Only one copy of the present broadside is traced in Parrish & Willingham 5140 and in OCLC, at the University of Georgia (also on wallpaper). "
