FOOTNOTE: "This tribute to the Boston Tea Party was \"sung with unbounded applause by Mr. [George H.] Andrews at the Federal Street Theatre\" in Boston. The lyrics are credited only to \"a gentleman of Boston,\" but OCLC assigns credit to Samuel Elliot. The narrator presents himself as a plainspoken old man from the country who had participated in the revolt: \"And then we went aboard the ships, our vengeance to administer / And didn't care a tarnal curse, for any King or minister / We made a plaguey mess o' Tea, in one of the biggest dishes / I mean, we steeped it in the Sea, and treated all the fishes.\" 5 in OCLC, and none traced at auction since 1901.
