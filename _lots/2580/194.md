FOOTNOTE: "An unusual broadside advertisement for a Manhattan hotel. The printed portion gives the bill of fare in detail for breakfast and dinner (topping out at 35 cents for a porterhouse of tenderloin steak). At center is a large photograph of the hotel with colorful patriotic bunting and lager beer signs, with pedestrians, carts and a heap of rubbish visible on the streets. Groot's Hotel was on the west end of Canal Street, in what is now the Soho neighborhood. It was apparently short-lived; the only contemporary references we have found date from December 1871 to October 1875. "
