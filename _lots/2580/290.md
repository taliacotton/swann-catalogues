FOOTNOTE: "The America First Committee was founded in 1940 to oppose American entry in the Second World War, soon gaining 800,000 dues-paying members. Their name and slogan sounded patriotic, but their leadership was tarnished by Nazi sympathies and antisemitism. A Boston rally featuring the group's leading spokesman Charles Lindbergh was cancelled on 7 December 1941 when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. The organization swiftly disbanded on the same day that Germany and Italy declared war on the United States. <br><br>These photographs were compiled to help expose links between the America First Committee and the Nazis. Many are annotated to prove the presence of known Nazi activists at AFC rallies and demonstrations. They come from the files of the weekly anti-AFC \"News Letter Published by the News Research Service,\" founded by the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee. Included is a leaf from the 1 October 1941 News Letter. Two small original photographs have captions taped below, as laid out in the 30 July 1941 News Letter. Also included is an inventory list headed \"Material Needed from News Research, Los Angeles.\" "
