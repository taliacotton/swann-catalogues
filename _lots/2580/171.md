DESCRIPT: "(MISSOURI.) John Porter."
CROSSHEAD: "Boonville Steam Ferry . . . Table of Distances."
at-a-glance: "Boonville, MO: Topic Print, October 1884"
TYPESET: "Illustrated broadside, 18 x 12 inches; wear and separations at folds with tape repairs, moderate edge wear."
FOOTNOTE: "The ferry is promoted as the most attractive crossing point on the Missouri River for emigrants heading west, crossing every twenty minutes with 25 wagons or 300 head of cattle. A table of distances shows in detail the land routes from Boonville to 20 other destinations, ranging as far as Dallas, TX. The text at bottom vouches for the accuracy of the tables, perhaps protesting too much: \"While the emigrant may be told differently, it will be by parties that are irresponsible.\" It also explains why other river crossings can only lead to misery and woe, including a washed-out road along the river southeast of Boonville, and the fine state of the road from Rocheport to Booneville along the north shore: \"Don't be persuaded that the road is bad from Rocheport. . . . Should anyone tell you so, he will be telling a falsehood and ought not to be believed\" as the road offers \"good camping grounds and plenty of water for man or beast.\" Illustrated with a cut of the ferry, the Birdie Brent, which was in operation from about 1871 to 1885. None traced in OCLC. "
