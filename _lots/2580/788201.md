FOOTNOTE: "First edition of the scripture of the Mormon church, released just days
  before the official establishment of the church on 6 April 1830. This was the only
  edition listing Joseph Smith as the \"author and proprietor\" rather than as the
  translator, and the only edition with his 2-page preface. This copy has the 2 pages
  of witness testimony at the end, but not the index pages which were inserted in
  later copies. \n\nThe first edition was printed with numerous variants; Crawley
  concludes that \"very few copies of the book exist which are entirely identical.\"
  This copy includes the uncorrected sheets for 6 of the 41 variants noted in Jenson:
  page 212 is numbered \"122\"; page 393 reads \"neither does\", page 487 is numbered
  \"48\"; page 514 reads \"maybe\" instead of \"may be\"; page 575 reads \"elder priest\"
  instead of \"elder or priest\"; and page 576 reads \"un-to the baptism.\" See Janet
  Jenson, \"Variations between Copies of the First Edition of the Book of Mormon,\"
  BYU Studies 13 (Winter 73), 214-222. Crawley 1; Flake 595; Grolier Hundred 37; Howes
  S623; Sabin 83038; Streeter sale IV:2262. \n\nProvenance: an early (but probably
  not original) owner was Nicholas Summerbell (1816-1889), who signed the front flyleaf
  and title page, and also added the date 1858. Summerbell was born in Peekskill,
  NY, was a Protestant clergyman in Cincinnati by 1850, and in 1858 became the founding
  president of Union Christian College in Meron, Indiana. During the Civil War he
  served as chaplain of the 115th Indiana Infantry. He spent his final years in the
  Cincinnati area. The signatures are a good match for the one seen on his 1888 passport
  application, and the notations to the volume appear to have been done during a careful
  reading by a scholar of religion. \n\nThis past year, the book was found in Wolfeboro,
  NH, a popular Mormon summer resort town. A resident asked her grandson to remove
  some boxes of rubbish to the trash, and he noticed this book inside. It has since
  been conserved, and a new front board added which might well pass for the original."
