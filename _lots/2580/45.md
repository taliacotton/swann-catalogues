FOOTNOTE: "Benjamin Day (1746/7-1794) of West Springfield, MA graduated from Yale in 1768. In 1776, when many of his former classmates were already fighting for independence, he went to the southwest frontier to help establish a British presence in Natchez territory, a newly claimed part of West Florida in what is now southern Mississippi. The leader of this expedition was a fellow Yale loyalist, Major Timothy Dwight, Class of 1744. Day was soon commissioned as a British major himself. The British settlement at Natchez failed within a year; Day moved on to British-held Savannah and St. Augustine. <br><br>At the end of the war, Day returned to Massachusetts, and drafted this petition to the state's congress: \"Your petitioner was formerly an inhabitant of this state, but left it in April 1776 as an adventurer to settle himself and family on the river Mississippi . . . until the year of 1782, when the savages becoming troublesome he left it with a determination of returning immediately to this commonwealth . . . and wishes to become a subject thereof.\" He requests to become a naturalized citizen of Massachusetts. <br><br>The request was granted and he became a successful wool dealer and hat manufacturer, resuming his place in the New England elite. Per his entry in \"Biographical Sketches of the Graduates of Yale,\" four of his great-grandsons followed him to Yale. "
