FOOTNOTE: "Hugo Joseph Von Hagen (1865-1939) was a geologist who rose to prominence in the oil industry in the 1920s. A native of Germany, he lived in Westchester County, NY but consulted widely in Illinois, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and elsewhere. He predicted the success of the Sigler gusher near Vernon, TX. He worked alongside his daughter Hildegard Von Hagen Kelley (born 1894), who played an active role in scouting drill sites and wrote at least one technical article for the Texas Oil Reporter. She apparently compiled these scrapbooks, and may have been the photographer--she apparently does not appear in any of the photographs, but she is frequently mentioned in the letters and articles. <br><br>The earlier of these two scrapbooks contains mostly clippings regarding Von Hagen's geology work, 1908-27, but also 19 letters and manuscripts, 1908-1931; 2 printed documents; and 38 photographs relating to oil field development. Also of interest is a photostat of a detailed report on artesian well drilling in Millville, NJ, 1917. The second album contains 156 mostly well-captioned photographs from 1926-27, a mix of oil well shots in Arkansas and family photographs from New York. One unusual highlight is a shot of an American Indian skeleton unearthed while digging a foundation at the family home in Waccabuc, NY. "
