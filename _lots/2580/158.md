FOOTNOTE: 'This intrepid merchant packed a lifetime''s worth of adventure onto these
  7 months and 29 pages. He was apparently experienced at sea, well versed in nautical
  language. He was not a ship''s hand, though. He and his partner Le Gros were apparently
  supercargoes representing the ship''s owners as traders. And the trading was apparently
  not quite legitimate, as they sailed on a ship of scoundrels against the backdrop
  of Jefferson''s embargo and the looming war with the United Kingdom. <br><br>The
  journal begins with our narrator shipping out from Philadelphia, and getting involved
  in an elaborate hunt for one more crew member. One man having fallen ill in Philadelphia,
  they failed to find a replacement in New Castle, DE, and went across the river to
  New Jersey, where a 52-mile carriage ride through the country landed one David Walling
  of Greenwich NJ, who after arriving on ship had second thoughts, "stating that his
  family affairs would not let him!" An advance of two doubloons helped settle his
  misgivings. They were hit by several gales before they had cleared Cape May, and
  then "an anchor gunboat No. 16 or a ''Tommy Jefferson'' boarded us and said, he
  believed we might proceed." <br><br>The ship''s unnamed captain is presented as
  a surly incompetent, with navigation being a particular weakness; he blames a faulty
  calibration of the compass on page 11. The crew often sighted land and then needed
  to ask passing ships where they were. The lack of a spyglass on the ship is also
  noted on page 9. Treacherous shoals were narrowly averted. As they fumbled up the
  New England coast, the captain "concluded our chart must be bad, or that the currents
  were so variable it was impossible to calculate for them" (page 12). The narrator
  and his friend Le Gros sometimes stayed up an extra watch at night to be sure the
  ship would not be dashed to pieces.<br><br>The ship''s first stop was, improbably,
  at the mouth of the remote Pleasant River in Maine, not far from the Canadian border.
  This is not described as a smuggling operation, but given the extreme secrecy, remote
  location, strict embargo regulations then in effect, and absence of customs officials,
  it certainly sounds like one. Our narrator and the captain "saw the father of the
  person we were in quest of having returned on board our vessel." Our narrator was
  sent on a rowboat 6 miles up river, and then "footing it first up and then down
  hill, now on all fours, and now up to my knees in mud, and now breaking my shins
  against the stones in the road." In rural Columbia, Maine he arranged the business
  and returned to his ship, which was anchored amid the rocks: "We were afterwards
  informed it was a great wonder we had not been dashed to pieces, having gone between
  many little islands where vessels never were before." The ship unloaded ballast
  and took on barrels of cargo. <br><br>The loading of the vessel was interrupted
  by an old local man "giving us his pedigree . . . and asking many foolish questions."
  If there''s one thing smugglers don''t like, it''s interlopers asking foolish questions.
  They devised a clever way to be rid of the nuisance: "One of the hands below dressed
  himself up with blankets as though sick. When coming on deck we directed our attention
  to him, asking the old man how they cured the smallpox in this part of the country.
  Small pox! The name so startled him that he jumped into his boat with more activity
  than I believe he ever possessed before." They loaded their barrels of cargo mostly
  by night in this desolate cove, with their local contact warning them about a dispatch
  boat which patrolled the coast. The promised warning shots failed to alert them
  when the dispatch boat made its appearance. "In close chase of us, we spread all
  our canvass with a fine breeze and soon left her behind . . . she soon turned about
  and bore up for two other vessels." Free of his late-night watches, his muddy slog
  to Columbia, and the successful escape from the authorities, our narrator then had
  "an opportunity for rest, I not having had sleep for three days and nights." This
  takes us through 31 August. <br><br>The ship then bore south toward the Caribbean
  with its mysterious cargo. The ship was inadequately provisioned, "without any liquor
  on board, our sugar and small stores lasting about half the passage when we substituted
  for coffee burnt biscuit boiled in water, having nothing but flour, biscuit and
  beef . . . we caught a barrel of rain water once in a heavy shower." The captain
  grew more surly and erratic: "When I went on deck I found him stretched his full
  length under the tiller with a rest provided by way of a pillow. I took the helm
  and remained at it 30 minutes before he awoke, when a quarrel immediately ensued
  in which he abused me much, [and] challenged Mr. Le Gros on the main deck to fight
  him." The captain shared a story from his time in charge of a legitimate mercantile
  voyage aboard the schooner Ann Pennock, in which he had broken open the barrels
  of flour, skimmed a small portion from each, and making himself up three new barrels
  of flour which he was able to sell on his own account. He proposed doing the same
  with his present cargo. <br><br>The ship arrived on the coast of Suriname (then
  a British colony) on 14 October to discharge their cargo, but "there being no chart
  on board which laid down the coast on soundings, the capt could not tell where we
  were, but one moment would say we were far to leeward of our port, and next a great
  way to windward." The captain led them into a (wrong) port, running onto shoals
  in sight of a British fort. The fort''s commandant offered cursory aid, but lacked
  the boats to make a full rescue and also noted that the ship was likely to be marauded
  by a nearby French fort. The ship was miraculously able to detach from the rocks
  at high tide, and made its way to Bram''s Point [Braamspunt], opposite the city
  of Paramaribo. "Here we lay all night, the crew keeping watch as it was feared our
  cables might break, but when it came to the captain''s turn he laid down on the
  hen coop and went fast to sleep, leaving the vessel to the mercy of the waves."
  Here the narrator secured permission to trade from the colonial governor, and set
  about selling his cargo. He found that the crew was selling barrels off the ship
  behind his back, and when confronted, all including the captain threatened to quit.
  At this point, the first mate Rogers had harsh words with the narrator''s friend
  Le Gros, and "threatened the owners and myself very hard, and I believe very little
  would have induced him and his companions to have risen on us, one of them having
  at all times a pistol, the only fire-arm on board." Our narrator was in charge of
  the ship''s ownership papers, which the captain began asking to take possession
  of: "We were so much alarmed that we could not go to sleep both at a time." <br><br>The
  ship passed Tobago, Grenada, and Haiti. At the eastern tip of Jamaica they were
  boarded by the HMS Haddock, whose commander demanded to see the supercargo and his
  papers. Our nervous narrator went aboard and was told his papers were "all my eye
  Betty Martin." That is old English slang for "complete nonsense." The commander,
  who "in his dress resembled a Frenchman with a monkey roundabout," subjected him
  to "a great deal of cross-questioning and insolent language, telling me if I was
  worth it, he would send me in a prize." They impressed one sailor, "for whom I begged
  very hard, but to no purpose, and indeed twas with difficulty I got the other though
  he had a protection [certificate], the poor fellow being so frightened, could say
  nothing clear." The ship proceeded on to Kingston, Jamaica "in distress with 3 feet
  of water in our hold." At that point our narrator and Le Gros parted ways from the
  ship and booked their passage home on a British ship. They arrived in New York on
  16 December and arrived in Philadelphia by stage four days later, "highly gratified
  at finding my relations and friends all well." <br><br>The last 4 pages of the narrative
  are devoted to a separate voyage: "After being here a few days it was concluded
  I should again go to sea, and on the 2nd Jan''y 1809 went on board the Ann Pennock
  cleared for Charleston." That was the same ship which his insane ex-captain had
  once defrauded, if you are paying close attention. This ship made it as far as Savannah,
  where they broke up upon the breakers trying to enter the harbor: "It was concluded
  the capt, his wife, and myself with 2 hands should make our escape and send the
  boat back for the others. We left the vessell with our trunks and in an hour and
  a half reached the shore. . . . We luckily had loaded pistols with us, by which
  we struck fire and so protected ourselves from the night air, we being on a desolate
  island with nothing to eat. . . . Fell in with a negro in a canoe. I went on board
  the canoe and after paddling several miles with him, got out of his canoe and footed
  it till sundown, when we arrived at a plantation, the property of Judge Stevens.
  . . . Next morn I crossed the ferry, at 12 o''clock arrived in Savanna, my feet
  all blisters." The Ann Pennock was towed into port for repairs on 17 March. In closing
  our narrator notes that "it was expected the city would be set on fire, many attempts
  having been made, but all nipped in the bud." <br><br>The author of this narrative
  has not been identified. He has provided enough circumstantial clues that an identification
  may not be impossible. On the other hand, he clearly took pains to avoid naming
  himself, his captain, his ship, and his cargo--likely because the entire voyage
  was of dubious legality. Why write the narrative, then? It appears to have been
  reworked and expanded from notes kept aboard the ship, with extensive revisions
  to improve the language and add details. One suspects he intended to publish it
  as a colorful maritime narrative, though we can find no hint that it ever made it
  to press. It''s not too late. <D>'
