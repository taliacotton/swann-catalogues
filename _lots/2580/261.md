FOOTNOTE: 'Minnie Belle Macomber Owens (1870-1953) wrote this note and collected this
  dust in Kingman County, south-central Kansas, not far from the Oklahoma line. The
  storms of this date were regarded as the worst this part of Kansas had yet seen.
  The Dust Bowl received its name just 4 days later as part of the newspaper coverage
  of the yet larger "Black Sunday" storm. Owens appeared in the 1930 census for Valley,
  KS (the township which contained the village of Rago). The widow of a farm laborer,
  she remained in Kansas and was buried with her husband in Kingman County. '
