He led the Spanish victory over the British at Pensacola in 1781, a major battle in the American Revolution, for which he was awarded honorary American citizenship in 2011. He was named viceroy of New Spain in 1785, and died of typhus in November 1786, so his documents in that role are not commonly seen. The main text in this proclamation begins \"Para que la reduccion de Matrícula de Marinería se estableciese en este Reyno.\" None traced at auction, not in Medina's Mexico, and one in OCLC."
