FOOTNOTE: "These three works were produced to fulfill contemporary curiosity regarding the Tennessee frontiersman, congressman, and Alamo hero.

Publisher's cloth, moderate wear; intermittent foxing; early bookplate and inscriptions on front endpapers. First edition. Among other highlights, this was probably the first tourist description of the infamous Five Points neighborhood in New York, about which Crockett proclaimed \"I would rather risque myself in an Indian fight than venture among these creatures after night.\" Anbinder, Five Points, page 26; Howes C896; Sabin 17565. Philadelphia, 1835. <br><br>\"Col. Crockett's Exploits and Adventures in Texas.\" Frontispiece plate. [4]. viii, [13]-216 pages. Publisher's cloth, moderate wear and fading, lacking spine label; moderate foxing and toning. First edition. \"Ingenious pseudo-autobiography, purportedly printed from the manuscript found with the baggage of a Mexican general slain at San Jacinto\"--Howes S654 (\"aa\"). Sabin 83778. None traced at auction since 1952. Philadelphia, 1836. <br><br>\"Narrative of the Life of David Crockett of the State of Tennessee.\" 211 pages.
