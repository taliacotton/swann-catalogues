They have hoisted the flag of Georgia on the drill room of one of our military companys, and on the drill room on another I saw the Stars and Stripes hoisted with the union down. There is an organization called Minute Men whose only cry is disunion. There was a man mobed and tared and cottoned last night for tampering with negros in some way.\" "
