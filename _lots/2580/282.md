It urges Congress to fund the \"construction of Harbors on the western shore\" of Lake Michigan, and points out that while the townsmen had paid more than a million dollars in taxes to the national treasury, other much smaller towns had already received lighthouses and other improvements. The harbor site and necessary improvements are described in detail. The final resolution: \"that the proceedings of this meeting be . . . published, and a copy sent to each member of Congress.\" Charles Durkee, who served as president of the meeting, would in 1849 serve as Wisconsin's first representative to Congress upon statehood.
