CROSSHEAD: "The Widow of an Indian Chief Watching the Arms of Her Deceas'd Husband."

TYPESET: "Mezzotint, 17¾ x 21¼ inches; trimmed within platemark, mounted on early stiff paper, 1-inch closed tear in lower right corner, moderate toning."
FOOTNOTE: "The first engraving of a much-beloved 1784 painting, usually known by the simpler title \"Indian Widow,\" which is now in the Derby Museum in England. It was likely inspired by a passage on Muscogee and Chickasaw funerary rites in James Adair's 1775 \"History of the American Indians,\" page 187: \"If he was a war-leader, she is obliged for the first moon, to sit in the day-time under his mourning war-pole, which is decked with all his martial trophies, and must be heard to cry with bewailing notes. . . . They are allowed no shade, or shelter.\" A stormy coastline and raging volcano can be seen in the background. Perhaps the painting could also be read as an allegory for Great Britain's recent loss of its American colonies. "
