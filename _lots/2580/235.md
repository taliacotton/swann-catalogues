FOOTNOTE: "The Oneida Communities were founded by John Humphrey Noyes (1811-1886), and practiced complex marriages--they are credited with coining the phrase \"free love.\" They later instituted a eugenic breeding program, had communal child care, and endured grueling sessions of mutual criticism. They had communities in Oneida, NY and Wallingford, CT. In these pages, \"Noyes expounded his doctrines of spiritualism, communism, and free love; though uneven in its editing, it was often well written and interesting\"--Mott, page II:207. The issues include community gossip and international news in addition to the many essays reflecting Oneida doctrine. Lomazow 568."
