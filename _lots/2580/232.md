FOOTNOTE: '8th and largest edition. "Most widely used guide to western waters in the
  early period"--Howes C855. Most of the maps are river sections; also includes a
  map of Pittsburgh, and a long description of the young city (pages 49-72). Appended
  in this edition for the first time is an expanded "Abridgement of Lewis and Clark''s
  Expedition," pages 343-349. Erickson, Literature of Lewis and Clark, page 105; Sabin
  17386. <br><br>Two of the manuscript notes are interesting. The map on page 91 is
  annotated to show the location of Blennerhassett Island, an important site in Aaron
  Burr''s conspiracy of 1806. On page 310, a description of vigilante "club law" used
  against the river pirates of Stack Island, MS is annotated: "Lynch law is club law."
  <br><br>We believe the Longfellow signature to be a forgery, although we would be
  pleased to think he may have owned this book for background research on the Louisiana
  portions of Evangeline. '
