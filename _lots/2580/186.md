DESCRIPT: "(NEW YORK CITY.) Roman Fekonja, artist."
CROSSHEAD: "Painting of the Manhattan Purchase."
at-a-glance: "[New York], 1906"
TYPESET: "Oil on canvas, 26½ x 39½ inches to sight, framed; some craquelure, a few areas of restoration, laid down on board; signed and dated at lower right."
FOOTNOTE: "A dramatic imagining of the famed purchase of Manhattan Island by Peter Minuit for $24 worth of trinkets. Minuit and his men are here seen displaying a chest full of beads, textiles, and metal goods in negotiation with a group of American Indians; a deed is ready to be signed in Minuit's left hand. The source image appears to be another painting by Alfred Fredericks, which was popularized in a 1902 engraving. See Peter A. Douglas, \"Illustrating the Manhattan Purchase.\" <br><br>The artist Roman Fekonja (1869-1910) arrived in the United States from the Austrian Empire in 1892. He made his residence in Manhattan, working mostly as a portrait painter, and became an American citizen in March 1906. That same year he completed this painting, an immigrant artist's affectionate tribute to his adopted city's founding legend. "
