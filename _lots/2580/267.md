FOOTNOTE: "In the wake of a treaty which allowed members of the Creek (Muscogee) nation to sell their individual land allotments, this company swooped in to gain broker rights over these sales. They promised an opportunity to \"Buy You a Home in the Rich and Fertile Creek Nation, Indian Territory,\" with more than 100,000 acres to choose from. The company is discussed in a 4 December 1902 article in the Arkansas Democrat, by which time they had gained control over an additional 150,000 acres and were planning \"one of the largest immigrant trains ever seen in Arkansas\" to bring the new settlers to Holdenville. 2 listed in OCLC.
