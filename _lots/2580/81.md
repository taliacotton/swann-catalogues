at-a-glance: "New York: H.H. Lloyd & Co., circa 1861"
TYPESET: "Hand-colored broadside, 36½ x 28½ inches; moderate edge wear, toning, and dampstaining."
FOOTNOTE: "This eye-catching patriotic broadside featured an entirely hand-colored flag as its centerpiece. The title quotation comes from Treasury Secretary John A. Dix from an official order he issued on 29 January 1861. Though issued in relation to the specific case of a revenue cutter threatened by secessionists, it became a general rallying cry for Union loyalists in the early months of the war. In the upper corners are matching cuts of a cannon and flag captioned \"The only compromise with traitors.\" The lower half is dedicated to the text of three patriotic songs: \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" \"Hail, Columbia! Happy Land!,\" and \"Red, White and Blue\" (better known as \"Columbia, Gem of the Ocean\"). The latter appears as a pair of slips pasted over the original printing--whether as replacement songs or correcting an errata, we do not know. We trace no other examples of this elaborate production in OCLC, at auction, in Filby & Howard's \"Star-Spangled Books,\" or elsewhere. "
