FOOTNOTE: 'Richard Varick (1753-1831) was a New York lawyer who served as a colonel
  and aide under generals Schuyler, Arnold and Washington during the Revolution, helped
  preserve Washington''s wartime correspondence, and served as the second post-war
  mayor of New York from 1789 to 1801. Offered here are two account books from his
  legal career, both shedding light on his professional connections with his fellow
  Federalist political allies, and particularly with his mentor and law partner John
  Morin Scott (1730-1784). <br><br>The earlier volume tracks motions and fees for
  dozens of legal cases from 1763 through 1774, apparently for the prominent New York
  lawyer and patriot John Morin Scott. Scott''s name scarcely appears in the journal,
  although two inserted receipts from 1769 both detail "register costs from complainants,
  Scott P compt." Scott is a plaintiff in a case on page 27, and a rare first-person
  entry on this page reads "I p''d the monies on this decree." On page 48, Scott again
  appears as plaintiff, this time against future Continental Congress member-turner-Loyalist
  Isaac Low. A power of attorney given to Scott is affixed to page 56.<br><br>The
  volume is kept in several different hands, apparently by various law clerks who
  worked for Scott; the bulk of the entries are unsigned. While a student at King''s
  College from 1771 to 1774, Richard Varick served as a clerk for Scott, and then
  after passing the bar became a partner in Scott''s firm. Signatures by Varick as
  "R. Varick" appear on pages 49, 51 (thrice), and 52, in addition to dozens of notes
  signed as "R.V." from 1772 to 1774. They document Varick''s first employment in
  the legal field, a humble beginning to a long and distinguished career as one of
  New York''s founding fathers. <br><br>This early account book also names several
  other important New Yorkers. James Duane, later Varick''s predecessor as the first
  mayor of New York under independence, is mentioned several times in his role as
  clerk of the Chancery Court. The longest and most complex case in the volume is
  Lewis Morris vs. Peter Van Brugh Livingston, with many dozens of lawyer''s filings
  recorded over most of two pages, 1763-1770 (pages 4-5). Both were prominent patriots,
  and Morris would sign the Declaration of Independence. Prominent merchants in New
  York''s Jewish community feature in the case of Solomon Simpson vs. Isaac Levy and
  Moses Franks on page 60. <br><br>The second volume covers a much later period, but
  is also related. Varick''s legal mentor John Morin Scott died in 1784. His widow
  Helena Rutgers Scott Myers (1732-1798) was left in possession of extensive land
  holdings in the Kayaderossera Patent in and near Saratoga County in upstate New
  York. She sold off the land in many smaller tracts, usually on credit. She remarried
  and outlived both of her children, leaving a granddaughter Elizabeth Litchfield
  Ross (1775-1799) as her executor--but this granddaughter died a few months later.
  At this point, Richard Varick stepped in to serve as administrator of his late law
  partner''s widow''s estate, which was large and complex. This account book, which
  seems to be largely in Varick''s hand, tracks the disposition of dozens of assets,
  each described briefly and keyed to an inventory (not present). The assets include
  bonds going back to 1785, mortgages, and especially unpaid debts on land sales from
  the Kayaderossera Patent. Varick carefully recorded the money due payments received
  on each one, often devoting a page or more in red and black ink to a single transaction,
  and signing at the bottom when that asset was retired. It was complex and painstaking
  work, perhaps somewhat routine for a lawyer. Varick was not a working lawyer at
  that point, nor was he a retired man of leisure; he was the sitting mayor of New
  York when this work began. He was voted out of office in 1801 in a wave of anti-Federalist
  sentiment, and continued serving as administrator of the Scott-Myers estate through
  its final settlement in 1816. <br><br>Among the notable figures in this second account
  book are James Gordon (1739-1810) and Beriah Palmer (1740-1812), two United States
  Representatives from the Saratoga area who had served as Helena Scott''s agents
  for many of her land sales in the 1790s; and New York State Senator Abraham Van
  Vechten (1762-1837), who apparently served as Varick''s collection agent upstate.
  Varick''s proper signature appears at the bottom of 29 pages; he writes his own
  name in the body of the accounts in countless other places. '
