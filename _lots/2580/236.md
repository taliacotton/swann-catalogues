FOOTNOTE: "In anticipation of a British campaign against the Gulf Coast, President Madison ordered Louisiana to raise a militia unit for its own defense. Peace negotiations to end the war were already underway, but rumors flew that the British would attempt to reverse the Louisiana Purchase and restore the territory to Spain. Governor Claiborne editorializes: \"A project so chimerical, illy comports with that character for wisdom, to which the English government aspires.\" Still, better safe than sorry: \"In case of invasion, the whole militia will be ordered to front the enemy. If our homes and fire sides are menaced, union, zeal and mutual confidence should warm every heart and strengthen every arm.\" The British did indeed launch a Gulf campaign the following month, which culminated in the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815.
