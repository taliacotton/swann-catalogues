FOOTNOTE: "Milford Zornes (1908-2008) was a well-established watercolor artist on the California art scene before being drafted into the Army for World War Two. This scrapbook begins with a letter from George Biddle of the War Department Art Advisory Committee, anointing him as \"one of a small group of outstanding American artists to go to an active war theater, and there to obtain a graphic record of the war. . . . Our committee expects you to be more than a news gatherer. The importance of what you have to say for the historian of the future will be the impact of the war on you, as an artist, a human being.\" Zornes was sent to China, Burma, and India, where he sketched scenes of civilian life. Included are 20 original pencil, ink or watercolor sketches by Zornes; 22 additional photographs of his art; 52 retained copies of V-Mail photographic letters sent home to his wife, many of them illustrated; 27 other letters; and 70 pieces of ephemera ranging from his 3-page itinerary of postings, to supply lists, to theater programs, to military personnel memoranda, to lists of art supplies. A rich documentary record of a key period in the career of a significant artist. "
