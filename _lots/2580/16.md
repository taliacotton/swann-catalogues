FOOTNOTE: 'White Mountain was also known as "Shot in the Eye" because of a wound he
  suffered at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. In 1901, he went east to participate
  in the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, NY, where he gave a remarkable interview
  to the Buffalo Courier (10 May 1901). In his long account of Little Bighorn, he
  asserted that Custer was not killed in battle--he committed suicide rather than
  face capture and torture. This account has not been corroborated by other sources.
  <br><br>This photograph was taken a few years later in September 1907 by De Lancey
  W. Gill, who was an illustrator and staff photographer for the Smithsonian’s Bureau
  of American Ethnology. One of his responsibilities was photographing American Indian
  leaders as they came through Washington on official business. White Mountain is
  wearing a peace medal depicting George Washington (issued in 1903). This photograph
  is not signed or captioned, but the Smithsonian holds a captioned negative.<br><br>WITH--5
  smaller uncredited prints also said to be by De Lancey Gill, although they are mostly
  field photographs rather than formal portraits. Two are captioned. One of them,
  "Kindling Fire by Friction," was actually shot by Jack Hillers for the Geological
  Survey circa 1870. These prints were apparently produced from earlier negatives
  in the early 20th century. '
