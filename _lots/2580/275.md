FOOTNOTE: "Andrew Jackson Hamilton (1815-1875) was a Texan who opposed secession and slavery. He was elected as a United States Congressman in 1859, fled the state in 1862, was appointed by Lincoln as a brigadier general, and served as military governor of Texas in 1865. This broadside was issued as part of his unsuccessful campaign to gain election as governor in 1869, running as a Republican against a more radical candidate. Here he argues for voting rights, well-funded but segregated schools, and increased immigration. 2 examples in OCLC (Yale and the University of Texas at Arlington).
