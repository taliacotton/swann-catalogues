FOOTNOTE: "Second edition of this classic Christmas song, but the first under the title \"Jingle Bells.\" The author was the son of abolitionist poet John Pierpont, but himself served in a Georgia cavalry unit for the Confederacy, and wrote several Confederate battle songs. His nephew John Pierpont Morgan (1837-11913) went on to be the most famous member of the family. Both early editions of this song are scarce; OCLC lists 2 examples of the 1857 printing titled \"One Horse Open Sleigh\", and only one example of this 1859 edition--at the Morgan Library founded by his wealthy nephew. Dichter & Shapiro, page 145; Fuld, page 313. "
