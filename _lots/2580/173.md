FOOTNOTE: "The author George Turnbull Moore Davis (1810-1888) was at this point a young lawyer in Alton, IL near Nauvoo. He went to serve in the Mexican War as a colonel, and then worked as a journalist in St. Louis and Louisville. He offers here an unsympathetic history of the Saints, as well as a close examination of the events surrounding Smith's deaths, based on local sources. He admits (on page 27) knowing the names of some of the perpetrators, although he does not divulge them. It was issued just two months after the June 27 killings. The University of Illinois holds a presentation copy dated 28 August, and newspaper advertisements appeared as early as 30 August. <br><br>This is one of the scarcer early Mormon-related tracts, with none traced at auction since 1915; not in Graff.
