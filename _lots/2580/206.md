FOOTNOTE: 'Auguste Edouart (1789-1861) was a French artist who toured the United States
  from 1839 to 1849, making silhouette portraits for the young nation''s elite. He
  kept a set of carefully cataloged duplicates, two of which are offered here. Most
  notable is Maria Hester Monroe Gouverneur (1802-1850), third child of the late fifth
  president, James Monroe. In 1820, she became the first child of a president to be
  married in the White House, when she married her father''s private secretary Samuel
  Laurence Gouverneur. They were fixtures of Manhattan high society until her return
  to Washington in 1840. This portrait was taken on Houston Street in New York. On
  the same day, her husband''s cousin Gouverneur S. Bibby (1790-1872) of New York
  was also captured in shadow. <br><br>The background of these portraits is given
  in detail in "American Silhouettes by August Edouart: A Notable Collection of Portraits
  Taken Between 1839-1849" by Arthur S. Vernay. Vernay acquired the entire set of
  Edouart''s reference copies and dispersed them after a 1913 exhibition in New York.
  His catalog lists both of these portraits on page 60, although the president''s
  daughter is there misidentified as Mrs. Maria K. Gouverneur Bibby. '
