FOOTNOTE: "William Marshall Swayne (1828-1918) was a sculptor from Chester County, PA who sculpted Lincoln and many other notables from life. As recounted in this remarkable collection of Swayne's notes and reminiscences, Lincoln recognized Swayne at a reception months after the bust was completed, and said \"You're the gentleman that made a mud bust of me. . . . I like yours best.\" Includes: <br><br>Partial manuscript extracts from Swayne's letters to his wife, 1859-1867. Pages 4-52 and 56, 12¼ x 8 inches; bound in upper corner with brass fastener, minor wear. Discusses in detail his personal sittings with Lincoln on 3 February, 27 March, 25 May, and 2 June 1864, with additional discussion of the casting and shipping, and an additional account of meeting Lincoln at a reception on 12 January 1865. Also discusses sculpting busts of James Buchanan, Simon Cameron, William Seward (\"as fidgety as a hen on a hot griddle for several days\"), Salmon Chase (who was entertaining his friend and sponsor Jay Cooke), Andrew Johnson, and many more, with long anecdotes about most of them. Also includes a long account of the Lincoln inauguration, the assassination, and other commentary on public affairs. The location of the original correspondence has not been traced, but it appears to be unpublished. <br><br>William Marshall Swayne. \"Reminiscences of Lincoln by a Treasury Clerk.\" 9 unbound manuscript pages, 9½ x 6 inches, unsigned but apparently in Swayne's hand; folds, minor wear. Swayne's personal memories of the several visits he paid to Lincoln. No place, circa 1909. <br><br>Mimeograph typescript of the same in 4 pages, titled \"Reminiscences of a Treasury Clerk in War Times,\" prepared in 1909 and copied in 1940. It notes that the original was read for Swayne at a Lincoln centennial meeting at the Kennett Square Firemen's Association, 12 February 1909. Another copy of this typescript is held by the University of California Santa Barbara Library. <br><br>William Marshall Swayne. \"A List of the Works in Sculpture Modelled and Remaining (in Plaster and Marble) in the Order in which they were Executed.\" Autograph Manuscript Signed, 3 pages, 12½ x 8 inches, bound in upper margin with brass fasteners. A list of more than 70 works, listing the sitters and the locations if known. No place, 17 December 1914. <br><br>A folder of correspondence: from Swayne to his son Richard M.B. Swayne regarding family history, Kennett Square, PA, 28 December 1910; and 4 letters regarding the gift of a Swayne plaster bust of Lincoln to the Smithsonian Institution, August 1940. <br><br>28 family photographs, most well identified, circa 1865-1910: cabinet cards, cartes-de-visite, and larger formats. One is a portrait of the artist, and another depicts his full-length Lincoln sculpture. One carte-de-visite shows a tall man in a stovepipe hat and beard posing with a family. We do not believe this man is Abraham Lincoln, but you may wish to believe it is. Others depict the artist's children and grandchildren, collateral relatives, and the family crests. <br><br>References: \"William Marshall Swayne: The Man Who Made a Mud Head of Lincoln,\" in Lincoln Lore 1493 (July 1962); Harold Holzer and Lloyd Ostendorf, \"Sculptures of Abraham Lincoln from Life,\" in Antiques, February 1978.
