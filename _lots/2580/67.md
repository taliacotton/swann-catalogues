FOOTNOTE: 'Robert E. Callahan (1892-1981) was the proprietor of Mission Village and
  then Indian Frontier Village from 1928 into the 1970s--well-known tourist attractions
  which operated somewhere on a spectrum between motels, museums, and theme parks.
  Callahan was born in Virginia with some Iroquois ancestry; he performed with Buffalo
  Bill''s Wild West Show as a boy, did some acting, wrote novels and screenplays,
  and then found success in the advertising world in Chicago. This enabled him to
  launch his dream in 1928, the Mission Village Auto Court in Culver City just north
  of Los Angeles. It was based loosely on the popular novel of the American Indian,
  Ramona by Helen Hunt Jackson (see lot above). In 1962, the land was appropriated
  for a freeway, and Callahan launched the similar Indian Frontier Village in the
  Mint Canyon neighborhood of Santa Clarita, further to the north. This village slowly
  became defunct as Callahan aged; he was still trying to find a buyer upon his death
  in 1981. Portions are now owned by the Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society.
  <br><br>This lot includes 7 scrapbooks of varying sizes kept by Callahan, plus some
  additional papers. One scrapbook contains mostly Mission Village promotional materials
  and advertisements, circa 1931-1942. Another is described as a guest book and does
  include extensive guest inscriptions from 1936 to 1949, but also photographs and
  correspondence. A more composed photo album includes shots of American Indian athlete-actor
  Jim Thorpe on a film set, and a Callahan production staged for the 1935 World''s
  Fair (both illustrated). A publicity shot of Roy Rogers and his band (Sons of the
  Pioneers?) is captioned "Roy Rogers, who in 1933 was Leonard Sly, and whose first
  rodeo experience was in his dad''s show at Ramona Village"--a story we cannot confirm.
  Two smaller photo albums contain mostly older images from Callahan''s early careers
  and journeys, about 3 x 4 inches. One includes a distant view of the famed 1910
  Jim Jeffries - Jack Johnson boxing match in Reno, NV. Two large leather portfolios
  contain larger photo prints, and tourist brochures collected from similar attractions.
  An occasional older photo makes its appearance, such as a chipped well-known group
  shot including Geronimo and General Nelson Miles from 1901. <br><br>Also included
  in this collection are two of Callahan''s original screenplays, "The Girl Outlaw"
  and "The Boy Jockey"; a file of correspondence from 1961 to 1979, mostly regarding
  the launch of the Indian Frontier Village and the final effort to sell it in 1979;
  and a file of Mission Village promotional materials. All in all, this is a rich
  archive on a quintessential mid-century Californian phenomenon. '
