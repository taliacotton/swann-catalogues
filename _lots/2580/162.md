FOOTNOTE: "An address by the leadership of the Democratic Party of Norfolk County, which was south and southwest of Boston including Dorchester, Braintree, Wrentham, Dedham, and other towns. They declared themselves as supporters of the Fugitive Slave Act, and opponents of abolitionists, pledging never to act in coalition with the radicals of the Free Soil Party. They supported George Boutwell's candidacy for governor. That November, Boutwell received only 32% of the popular vote, but his Whig opponent narrowly missed a majority, throwing the election to the legislature--where a coalition of Democrats and Free Soilers put Boutwell over the top. None traced in OCLC or at auction, nor do we find the text in newspaper searches. "
