FOOTNOTE: "A letter by a French settler in rural Maryland during the Revolution. He describes his residence as \"Montgomery County near Seneca Bridge at Spencer's Tavern\" (the only passage in English); and further clarifies his location as 25 miles from Georgetown, 30 miles from Frederick, MD, and 4 miles from the Potomac River--approximately near the location of Seneca Creek State Park in Gaithersburg today. He writes to the French consul in Baltimore, apparently a good friend, and proclaims his status as a \"good Frenchman.\" He urges the consul to invest in a much-needed general store in his location, and wonders of the Comte de Grasse's naval fleet has yet arrived in Virginia. He also discusses the Great Falls of the Potomac, a ball held in Baltimore, a cock fight, and much more. Provenance: collection of Forest G. Sweet of Battle Creek, MI; Parke-Bernet sale, 22 October 1957. "
