CROSSHEAD: "Views of the Villard \"Gold Spike\" excursion which completed the Northern Pacific."
at-a-glance: "Fargo, Dakota Territory, 8 September 1883 (images from Powell County, MT)"
TYPESET: "8 imperial views of the Gold Spike ceremony on printed mounts; 2 smaller uncaptioned views; and one imperial view of an unrelated Montana Press Association gathering from 1886; minor dampstaining, a few with softening at edges or corners from moderate water damage; one Gold Spike view penciled on verso \"Mr. & Mrs. J.H. Mills.\""
FOOTNOTE: "Construction on the Northern Pacific Railroad began in 1870 from Minnesota and the Pacific coast, and both sides met in Powell County, Montana. The railroad's president Henry Villard led a grand excursion to the site to lay a ceremonial final spike, which was driven in by former United States president Ulysses S. Grant (not shown here). Documenting the scene was the well-known western photographer Frank Jay Haynes (1853-1921), the official photographer for Northern Pacific. Two of the photographs show a delegation of Crow Indians at the site; another shows the festively decorated first locomotive to cross over the last spike. This lot includes: <br><br>8 of the 23 imperial views from Haynes's series, \"The Villard Gold Spike Excursion, Opening of the Northern Pacific Railroad, Septe. 8, 1883,\" albumen prints about 6¼ x 9½ inches on the photographer's printed mount with complete inventory list on verso, with the view's title marked in pencil: \"1541 5th Infantry Band at Last Spike\"; \"1542 Iron Car-horse, 'Nig,' and Tracklayers\"; \"1543 Independence Creek Valley, Last Spike\"; \"1544 During the Oration at Last Spike\"; \"1547 Indian Council at Last Spike\"; \"1548 Crow Indians at Last Spike\"; \"1549 First Train over the Last Spike\"; and \"1550 Group of Section Four at Last Spike.\" <br><br>Two smaller albumen photographs of Northern Pacific trains, about 4½ x 8 inches, uncredited and uncaptioned, on original plain brown mounts. One of these is a duplicate of \"1549 First train over last spike\"; the other is on a matching mount and is likely also a Haynes photograph from the same event. <br><br>Another later imperial-format albumen print by Haynes, 6¼ x 8½ inches on mount with printed caption, \"Montana Press Association, Yellowstone National Park, August 1886.\" <br><br>Provenance: personal copies of James Hamilton Mills (1837-1904), a Montana newspaper editor and territorial secretary; consigned by a descendant. Mills is said to be standing in the rear row of the Montana Press Association photograph, 6th from the right. "
