pullquote: THE SECRETARY OF WAR PRESENTS HIS NEW COMMANDING GENERAL
DESCRIPT: "(CIVIL WAR.)"
CROSSHEAD: Carte-de-visite portrait of newly commissioned Lieutenant General Grant,
  signed by Edwin Stanton.
at-a-glance: "[Washington], 11[?] March 1864"
TYPESET: Albumen photograph, 3½ x 2 inches, on original mount with E. & H.T. Anthony  of
  New York backmark; chipping to upper right ½ inch of image with slight loss to caption,
  1½-inch light diagonal crease in same area, other minor wear and foxing; signed
  and inscribed by Edwin Stanton as Secretary of War on recto and verso.
FOOTNOTE: 'Ulysses S. Grant began the Civil War as a colonel, but rose quickly through
  a series of dramatic victories and the support of President Lincoln and Secretary
  of War Stanton. On 2 March 1864, Lincoln made him a Lieutenant General in command
  of the entire Union army--a rank not held by any officer since George Washington.
  Grant arrived in Washington to receive the honor on 8 March, and formally received
  the promotion at a cabinet meeting the following day. <br><br>Stanton was obviously
  delighted with the appointment, and this card serves as evidence. Above Grant''s
  stern visage are inscribed the names of three of his greatest victories (with Fort
  Donelson misspelled): "Donaldson, Vicksburg, Chattanooga," with "Major General Grant"
  inscribed in Stanton''s hand below. On verso, Stanton has signed the card just days
  after the appointment: "With regards of Edwin M. Stanton, March 11[?], 1864." <br><br>It''s
  obviously very unusual to find a photograph of one important historical figure,
  signed by another. We don''t know who Stanton signed this card for, but it seems
  clear that he was using the card to boast about "his" new commanding general. Three
  years later, Grant would temporarily replace Stanton as Secretary of War, a move
  which triggered Andrew Johnson''s impeachment hearings. '
