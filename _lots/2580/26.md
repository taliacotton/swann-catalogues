FOOTNOTE: 'This print depicts an incident on 25 January 1774 in Boston, just a month
  after the Boston Tea Party. Loyalist customs official John Malcolm threatened to
  beat a small boy with a cane. When local patriot George Hewes protested, Malcolm
  caned him in the forehead and knocked him unconscious. That night a mob dragged
  Malcolm from his home, stripped him to the waist, tarred and feathered him, threatened
  to hang him, and forced him to drink repeated toasts of tea to the King and Queen.
  This print shows a noose hanging from a "Liberty Tree" with the Stamp Act posted
  upside down. In the background, boxes of tea are being dumped from a ship in the
  background--believed to be the earliest image of the Boston Tea Party. <br><br>The
  artist Philip Dawe was a student of the great British satirist William Hogarth.
  This was first in a series of 5 prints he created on the Malcolm incident. In 1904,
  an entire monograph was devoted to this series of Dawe prints: R.T.H. Halsey''s
  "The Boston Port Bill as Pictured by a Contemporary London Cartoonist," where "The
  Bostonians" is illustrated facing page 85, and described from pages 82 to 87. Cresswell
  670; Reese, Revolutionary Hundred 16 ("One of the most famous political cartoons
  of the American Revolution"). <br><br>Provenance: collection of William Gaston (1820-1894),
  who served as both Mayor of Boston and Governor of Massachusetts; his granddaughter
  Ruth Gaston Howard (1894-1974); her daughter Anne Howard Karri-Davies (1916-2011);
  gift to the consignor. '
