DESCRIPT: "(AMERICAN REVOLUTION--1778.)"
CROSSHEAD: "Invoice for the support of 25 soldiers' families in Wallingford, CT ."
at-a-glance: "No place, 11 December 1778"
TYPESET: "Manuscript document signed by a Wallingford official. 2 pages, 13½ x 8 inches; folds, uncut."
FOOTNOTE: "This invoice includes 25 expense lines submitted by the town of Wallingford to the State of Connecticut for the support of individual families, each with a \"stipulated price\" and a much higher \"price given.\" Each amount is different, suggesting that the support was rendered as needed, rather than in a fixed stipend. The docketing reads \"Wallingford acct for supplying soldiers' families,\" and the first expense is for \"Sundrys bought for the family of David Stone as per bill.\" Some of the names are easily identified as having served in the Continental Army. Levi Munson was a lieutenant in the 6th Connecticut Regiment, and Ephraim Chamberlain a lieutenant in the 7th. One woman appears on the list, Joanna Page, who may have been a war widow. The account concludes with the payment of £914 to the town of Wallingford, signed for by Gideon Hosford. "
