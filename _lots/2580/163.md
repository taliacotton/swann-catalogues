The collection includes one lone letter written by the matriarch, to her stepson George on 24 January 1848: \"I return the snuff you sent last. It is not what is wanted. I did not think . . . that I should embark so extensively in the snuff trade, but so it is.\" <br><br>Her most regular correspondent in this collection is her stepson George Russell (1802-1857), a Boston clerk and church deacon, represented with 78 letters from 1834 to 1850 and undated. His 19 January 1842 letter discusses a controversy over abolitionist Isaac Knapp, former co-publisher of the Liberator: \"We have strange 'Times' here in the city--that paper has ben trying to get up a mob for Mr. Knapp, but has not yet succeeded. Mr. K is preaching at Bowdoin Square Church & tonight & last night the whole spacious square was crowded with thousands of people who were desirous of a row. . . . Last night they followed Mr. Knapp home to the house of a Baptist brother\" who \"invited them into his parlor, told them if they would come in Mr. Knapp would pray for them all night. They gave the man 3 cheers for his courage & then went off.\" On 3 February 1844 he wrote \"Garrison & his party are driving to the destruction of everything good.\" <br><br>15 letters are from Amelia's daughter Julia Russell Wright (1817-1849) and her husband, the Rev. Daniel Wright (1808-1895), from 1841 to 1852 (after Julia's death), mostly written from Cambridge and North Scituate, MA.<br><br>6 are from daughter Nancy Russell Whitman (1807-1847), who married Edward Burke Whitman in 1839. The letters are dated 1840-45 and undated, mostly from Cambridge, MA. <br><br>24 are from daughter Catherine Russell (1814-1859), mostly from Cambridge and other towns in Massachusetts, 1837-1850. <br><br>Also included are 22 miscellaneous letters, 1834-1884 and undated; an 1846 postal receipt; and 16 pieces of ephemera, memoranda, and manuscript verse.
