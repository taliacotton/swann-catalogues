FOOTNOTE: "John Lindsay Dunlap (1798-1875) of Watertown, NY was an eccentric patent medicine salesman who ran for president in 1864. He declared Ulysses S. Grant as his running mate, although we find no evidence that Grant ever accepted this nomination, or was even aware of it. This broadside offers tribute to the brave soldiers of the Mexican War--not what we might expect in 1863. It also features a letter from a Union Army lieutenant from a Watertown regiment, asking Dunlap to run for president as \"the second Henry Clay and the great war horse of the North.\" Dunlap's response: \"Upon mature deliberation, I have reluctantly consented to let my name be used.\" At bottom is a small advertisement for Dunlap's patent medicines, comparing his accomplishments to Christopher Columbus, Cleopatra, and Napoleon Bonaparte. No other examples traced in OCLC or elsewhere.. "
