FOOTNOTE: "James Henry \"Chief\" Rheamont (1866-1969) was an active participant in the large Spiritualist community at Chesterfield, Indiana. He achieved some national prominence in 1921 when a seance attendee turned on a flashlight while Rheamont was in a trance, leading Rheamont to hit the man with a trumpet (see the Boston Globe, 17 July 1921). In this photograph, Rheamont can be seen with the spirits of ancestors captured either during a seance or by double-exposure. His obituary described him as also being a \"manufacturer of Pocatala medicines\" and \"lecturer on Indian welfare.\""
