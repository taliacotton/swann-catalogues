Having first worked for a larger design company, Unimark, he and his wife started their own firm, Vignelli Associates, in the early 1970s. His clients included some of the largest and most recognized brands including Bloomingdales, IBM, Knoll and American Airlines. Vignelli updated his iconic 1972 New York City Subway Map for the May 2008 issue of <i>Men's Vogue</i>. An edition of 500 signed prints were made available through the magazine's website, with all proceeds going to the NY based charity \"Greenworker Cooperatives.\" This is the smaller, later printing. The revised edition of the 1972 map was printed in February 1978."
