TYPESET: "From 1908 to 1914, the Munich-Herrsching Ceramic Works was a prominent producer of Jugendstil pottery. Hohlwein's graphic still life with three vases is an exceptional design, in which the window is reflected in the vessels, an effect that Hohlwein achieves using the white of the paper. The bold image is further strengthened by the organization of the typography which is firmly aligned with the width of the image. Hohlwein / Stuttgart 32, Hohlwein / Munich p. 156, DFP-III 1364, MoMA 82.1990."
