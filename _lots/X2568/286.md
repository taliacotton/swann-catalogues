TYPESET: "Kurozumi worked for the Osaka National Railways in the 1930s. The small number of his posters that have surfaced are classic Art Deco images. The simple, bold, stylized images reflect his ability to give the \"illusion of modernization\" through the use of ideographic forms (Fraser p. 63). Advertising new schedules with more trains travelling to Sakurai and Wakayama, the artist here presents information in a minimal way; employing a station clock, crossing gates, and a plume of smoke from an engine."
