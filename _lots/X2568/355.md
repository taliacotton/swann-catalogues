TYPESET: "Rand was first employed by IBM in 1956 to redesign the company's logo. He continued consulting for the company for more than 30 years, redesigning their logo at least twice more. In 1981, he came up with the now-famous rebus, which has become one of the most famous and recognizable corporate identity statements of the 20th century. It took a year for the company to actually use the design in promotion, at which point they printed it as a poster with small text at the bottom explaining the significance of each element of the rebus. This is the first printing. Modern Poster 211, Encyclopedie de l'Affiche p. 106, Modern American 100, Resnick 72, Rand / GGG p. 23, MoMA 520.1983."
