This collage, inspired by a sign from Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie, is related to a public art project for DC that the artist has been working on since 2012. Sparrow is investigating the similiarties between the Berlin Wall and the 1960s riots in DC, looking at the urban partitions they both created. Before earning an MFA degree in painting from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1993, Sparrow was the recipient of honors with a Skowhegan residency, a fellowship for a National Gallery of Art internship and a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. His work is in such collections of the William Benton Museum of the University of Connecticut and Mary Lou and George B. (Spike) Bietzel, Chappaqua, NY."
