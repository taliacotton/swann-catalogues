Printed and published at the Master Print Project, Massachusetts College of Art and Design, where Winfred Rembert was an artist-in-residence.   All Me  is also the name of the artist's series of paintings and prints.<br><br>Rembert's autobiographical print is filled with undulating figures swinging their axes under what one can imagine are the worst possible conditions. The black and white stripes of the uniforms blend together and become an abstract composition. The twisted bodies and ghost-like facial expressions are ones the artist would have seen daily for seven years."
