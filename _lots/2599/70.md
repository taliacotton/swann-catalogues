TYPESET: "<p>Color screenprint on cream wove paper, 1966. 469x331 mm; 18½x13⅜ inches,
  full margins. Signed, titled and numbered 3/22 in pencil, lower margin.<br><br>A
  good impression of this rare, early screenprint, with vibrant colors. Another impression
  is in the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.<br><br>In
  1960, Amos moved to New York and made prints in Robert Blackburn's Printmaking Workshop.
  In 1964, she became the sole female member of the Spiral Group collective. By 1966,
  the group disbanded and Amos completed her MA in art education from New York University.
  The same year Amos was painting dynamic, colorful portraits that defied conventions
  like <em>Baby</em> ,1966, collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art and the
  Studio Museum in Harlem, and <em>Flower Sniffer</em>, collection of the Brooklyn
  Museum. In <em>Gold Face Type</em> , Amos created an inventive self-portrait - one
  in which she is both reflectively looking over her shoulder and directly confronting
  the viewer.</p>"
