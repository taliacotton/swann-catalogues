  8x5Â½ inches, wide margins. Signed, titled and numbered 7/25 in pencil, lower margin.<br><br>Born
  in Atlanta, Georgia, printmaker and designer Wilmer Jennings attended Morehouse
  College and studied under Hale Woodruff, who introduced him to the principles of
  modernism. Under the Graphic Arts Division of the WPA in 1934, they worked together
  on two notable murals that represented the African American experience: <em>The
  Negro in Modern American Life: Agriculture and Rural Life, Literature, Music, and
  Art</em> and<em> The Dream</em>. Unfortunately, both murals were destroyed.<br><br>After
  graduating from Morehouse College, Jennings moved to New England to attend the Rhode
  Island School of Design (1933). Hired by the Rhode Island WPA in 1935, he created
  works that portrayed the economic hardships of African Americans during the Depression.
  The subjects of his later work included landscape and social realist scenes of his
  community. After injuring his right hand in 1957, Jennings began to train himself
  to draw and paint left-handed, which he continued to do up until the time of his
  death. Wilmer Jennings's artwork is in the permanent collections of the Rhode Island
  School of Design Art Museum and The Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>"
