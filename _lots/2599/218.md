  in Cuba, Havana, Cuba, October, 2014.<br><br>Haunting and beguiling, <em>Intolerencia
  </em>is a collagraph from Belkis Ayón's final body of works. The tondo lures the
  spectator into a world of existential loss and faceless figures who are stripped
  of their voice. The layered collage-like appearance of the image is based on Ayón's
  expert collagraphic technique, utilizing mixed-media and absorbencies in her collaged
  cardboard matrix to create a printed lexicon rich in nuances and textures.</p>"
