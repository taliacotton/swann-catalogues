The tondo lures the spectator into a world of existential loss and faceless figures who are stripped of their voice. The layered collage-like appearance of the image is based on Ayón's expert collographic technique, utilizing mixed-media and absorbencies in her collaged cardboard matrix to create a printed lexicon rich in nuances and textures."
