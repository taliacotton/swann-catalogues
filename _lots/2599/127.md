  <em>Spatial Image III</em> is an excellent example of his works on paper, and a
  significant work in his development of the dry pigment technique, inspired by Pueblo
  sand paintings of the American Southwest. After working in Taos, New Mexico, Clark
  created a new group of large-scale painting in acrylic and works on paper composed
  of brown, blue, red, and orange pigment during a three month stay in Paris. He reinterpreted
  the oval forms that preoccupied him in the 1960s, reinterpreting the curved shapes
  as glowing clouds of atmospheric color.<br><br>In June Kelly''s Randall Galleries
  catalogue essay, Clark describes this experimental approach: "With my hands forcing
  the colors, it is no longer the classic pastel technique. It is more akin to the
  sand painting of the Navajo and Pueblo Indians. The possibility of changing the
  image is immediate and the opportunity for spontaneity is greatly enhanced. For
  me it has been a personal breakthrough in the abstract experience."<br><br>Born
  in New Orleans, Louisiana, he studied at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1946
  to 1951, and in 1952 at the Academy de la Grande Chaumière in Paris, where he lived
  until 1958. George Sugarman then persuaded him to return to New York to help found
  the Brata Gallery with Ronald Bladen, Al Held and others. Clark exhibited there
  until 1966, when he returned to France for three more years. He has acknowledged
  the influence of the paintings of Nicolas de Stael and the music of Miles Davis
  and Charlie Parker, and later the gestural abstractions of Hans Hartung and Pierre
  Soulages. He exhibited internationally and his paintings are in numerous institutional
  collections including the Art Institute of Chicago, Brooklyn Museum, Detroit Institute
  of the Arts, Museum of Modern Art, Pérez Art Museum, Saint Louis Art Museum and
  the Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>'
