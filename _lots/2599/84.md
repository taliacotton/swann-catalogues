Signed and dated in ink, lower right.<br><br>Provenance: acquired directly from the artist; private collection, Netherlands (1991); private collection, Netherlands.<br><br>  Million Dollar Idea  is a significant artwork by Sam Middleton, a   tour-de-force  of his improvisitional technique, combining Abstract Expressionist painting with densely collaged surfaces of various found papers from billboards, magazines and newspapers. It is a summation of a modernist approach that reflected not only in his artistic practice, but his expatriate life and great interest in jazz music. Middleton once described, \"the artist is, like a human mirror, reflecting ideas, images, feelings and the impressions of his environment as he sees and feels them. In this sense collage is a chain of connecting ideas and expressions like fragments of that broken mirror, gathered and mended”. This 7-foot long monumental work by Middleton is the largest work of the artist to appear at auction."
