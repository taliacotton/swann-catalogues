  on the possibility of romantic love or where are you going with that gun in your
  hand, Bobby Seale and Huey Newton discuss the relationships between expressionism
  and social reality present in Hitler's paintings</em>.<br><br>Daniel Joseph Martinez’s
  sculptures depict the Black Panther leaders Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale in Carrara
  marble, a highly coveted stone symbolizing wealth and heroic statuary. He casts
  the history of Black revolutionaries into the artistic tradition of monumentality
  to expose cultural contradictions and increase public awareness.<br><br>Throughout
  his career, Martinez engaged in an interrogation of social, political, and cultural
  mores by creating artworks spanning the ephemeral to the solid. His practice takes
  the form of text, sculpture, photography, painting, installation, robotics, performance,
  and public interventions. Their commonality is they all address topics of race,
  class, and sociopolitical boundaries present within American society.<br><br>Martinez

  been exhibited in numerous exhibitions, including Los Angeles County Museum of Art,

  Bellagio Residency, Italy, American Academy Fellowship, Berlin, Herb Alpert Award
  in the Arts, ArtPace Foundation Fellowship and Residency, Pollock-Krasner Foundation
