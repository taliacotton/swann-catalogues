  Push  epitomizes the unique and striking abstract painting of Kenneth Victor Young.
  Painting wet into wet, Young achieved these compositions of floating orbs and haloes
  suggesting forms in a floating or fluid space. With his distinctive style, Young
  became associated in the early 1970s with the rise of the Washington Color School;
  in 1968, he had his solo exhibition at the Franz Bader Gallery in Washington, DC,
  which represented him until 1977.<br><br>Born in Kentucky, Young''s career began
  in the sciences - he studied and taught physics at Indiana University and chemical
  engineering at the University of Louisville. In the early 1960s, Young switched
  his studies to pursue visual art, joining a circle of artists at the University
  of Louisville including G. Caliman Coxe, Sam Gilliam and Bob Thompson. After moving
  to Washington, DC in 1964, he worked at the Smithsonian Institution for over 35
  years as an exhibition installation designer. He was also an art instructor at the
  Corcoran Gallery of Art and the Duke Ellington School of the Arts in Washington,
  DC. Young also had solo exhibitions at the Carl Van Vechten Gallery at Fisk University
  in 1973, and at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, DC in 1974. His paintings have
  also been included in exhibitions at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Corcoran
  Gallery and the Washington Project for the Arts, and are in the permanent collections
  of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Gallery of Art and the Perez
  Art Museum Miami.'
