Printed at the Brandywine Workshop, Philadelphia.<br.<br>Additional impressions are in the permanent collections of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design.<br><br>In a 2010 interview with the   Huffington Post  about the print, Dr. Willis recalled: “I was an undergraduate at Philadelphia College of Art and one of my professors said to me, 'you're taking up a good man's space, you should not be in this program. All you're going to do is get married, get pregnant, have a baby and a good man could have been in your seat.' I'll never forget that moment. I was so humiliated and embarrassed because this was a public event. And of course what happened? When I graduated, I got pregnant. [Laughs] I was embarrassed. I couldn't celebrate the fact that I was having a kid. Recently, my son found a contact sheet with photographs of my pregnant belly and he said, 'mom, you never printed these.' I remembered this story. What I realized in terms of flipping the script, was that I made space for a good man, by having my son, who is a photographer. Flipping that into positive energy and still creating work.” Martha St. Jean, “A Portrait of Deborah Willis,”   The Huffington Post,  April 6, 2010."
