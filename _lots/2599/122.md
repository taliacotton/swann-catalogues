  was beginning the next phase of her career as a professor of art at SUNY, Stony
  Brook, she was injured in a serious car accident that left her with acute memory
  loss. Her subsequent 1980-81<em> Oval Memory</em> series transformed postcards saved
  from her global travels into elaborate assemblages that helped reconstruct her memories.
  <em>War Games Disguised II </em>and lot 123 <em>Mask</em> show how Pindell's experimental
  assemblage evolved to incorporate political and social themes.</p>"
