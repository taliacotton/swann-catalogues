Spratley court appointed administrator, with estate ink stamp verso; private collection, New York.<br><br>Beauford Delaney made this beautiful work on paper during the height of his Parisian abstract period. Delaney's masterful intertwining of layers of paint reflects his growing bold expression with color during his period exhibiting with Galerie Paul Facchetti. Delaney began working in oil on paper in the late 1950s, and a number of these large works of oil on paper by Beauford Delaney were in the artist's estate. This mid-career abstraction is his largest work on paper to come to auction."
