  Ford, Washington, DC.<br><br> <em>Middle Passage</em> reflects the influence of
  African textile design in Akili Ron Anderson's practice. His artwork pays tribute
  to the African American community by using patterns, symbols, and culturally specific
  references. Inspired by the writings of Alain Locke and like the artists of the
  Harlem Renaissance, Anderson believes that the art of African Americans should document
  their heritage and contemporary life in uplifting ways. It is meant to be a celebration
  of African culture and a source of inspiration for African Americans. Also, Anderson
  is a member of AfriCOBRA which is reflected in his practice. He has continuously
  strived to make the dissemination of art accessible to this community by designing
  reliefs, stained glass, murals, and installations for religious, cultural, and public
  institutions.<br><br>Anderson studied at the Corcoran School of Art, 1964-65, and
  earned both a BFA and MFA from Howard University in 1969 and 2008, respectively.
  Recent solo exhibitions include Hampton University Museum, July 9 - November 18,
  2016. His work has been exhibited in<em> It Takes a Nation: Art for Social Justice,</em>
  American University Museum, Washington, DC with Emory Douglas, and <em>The Black
  Panther Party, AFRICOBRA, and Contemporary Washington Artists</em>, curated by Sandy
  Bellamy, September 6 - October 23, 2016. He has been an associate professor in the
