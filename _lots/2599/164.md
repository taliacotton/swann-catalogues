His artwork pays tribute to the African American community by using patterns, symbols, and culturally specific references. Inspired by the writings of Alain Locke and like the artists of the Harlem Renaissance, Anderson believes that the art of African Americans should document their heritage and contemporary life in uplifting ways. It is meant to be a celebration of African culture and a source of inspiration for African Americans. Also, Anderson is a member of AfriCOBRA which is reflected in his practice. He has continuously strived to make the dissemination of art accessible to this community by designing reliefs, stained glass, murals, and installations for religious, cultural, and public institutions.<br><br>Anderson studied at the Corcoran School of Art, 1964-65, and earned both a BFA and MFA from Howard University in 1969 and 2008, respectively.
