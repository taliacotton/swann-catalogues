FOOTNOTE: "Gelatin silver emulsion on tobacco leaf on handmade Japan paper, 2004. 647x622 mm; 25½x24½ inches, (sheet). From the series   The Tobacco Project  2003 - 2007.<br><br>  Morgan  is from Accra Shepp's study that explores photoreactive materials and a socio-economic investigation of the history of tobacco farming. The leaves he uses in replacement of photopaper are dried then flatened. Next, they are chemically treated. Ultimately, a light-sensitive coating is applied to record and fix the image. From 2003 - 2007, Shepp traveled to three farms in Georgia, Kentucky, and North Carolina to explore the relationship of tobacco farmers with their crop and the land on which it grows. He uses photoreactive materials to transform dried leaves into canvases that explore tobacco's fraught history and cultivation through the use of 18th and 19th-century enslavement to 21st-century migrant labor.<br><br>Born 1962 in New York City, Shepp is a writer and photographer. He graduated from Princeton University in 1984, where he studied with Emmet Gowin, then attained an MFA from NYU where he studied at the Institute of Fine Arts and the Conservation Center. His work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and The Victoria and Albert Museum."
