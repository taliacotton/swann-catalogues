Signed in oil, lower left.<br><br>Provenance: private collection, New York.<br><br>This modern oil painting typifies the mid-career work of artist, illustrator and educator Earl Hill. Hill’s paintings from the 1960s emphasize the humanity of ordinary individuals, depicting their work and daily experiences. Born in New York in 1927, Hill spent much of his youth in Bells Mill, a small town in rural Virginia. He returned to New York to attend New York University, where he studied art with Hale Woodruff. He graduated in 1951 with a degree in education and went on to obtain his master’s degree from the City College of New York in 1960. Hill taught art appreciation in public schools in New York, Baltimore, and the Virgin Islands while continuing to study painting at a variety of institutions. Hill retired from teaching in 1984, a year before his death. His paintings are found in The Hewitt Collection of African-American Art, Harvey B. Gantt Center, Charlotte, NC.
