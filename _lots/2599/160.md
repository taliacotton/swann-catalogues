Scott Artist Trust.<br><br> Depicted as an indomitable matriarch, Maryann Armstrong is the mother of trumpet virtuoso Louis Armstrong. She gave birth to him in 1901 in Battlefield, New Orleans. After the birth of her daughter, Beatrice, and the absence of her husband, she suffered poor health. Needing to work, she had Louis and his sister move in with their grandmother for the next five years. After fifth grade, Louis began picking up odd jobs to help support his mother and younger sister. Throughout his young life, Maryann was an ardent supporter of his musical talent.<br><br>Educator, sculptor and printmaker John T. Scott was born in Gentilly, Louisiana in 1940, and raised in New Orleans' Ninth Ward. His father worked as a restaurant cook and chauffeur while his mother stayed home.
