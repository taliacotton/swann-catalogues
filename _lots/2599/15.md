  Kreutzberg (1902 - 1968). Kreutzberg is an important figure in German ballet and
  modern dance whom Richmond Barthé befriended when he performed in New York in the
  1930s. Barthé made several sculptures of the expressive dancer in busts and figures.
  Barthé himself studied Martha Graham''s dance techniques in an effort to understand
  the movement and form of dancing figures.<br><br>A plaster cast of this head was
  exhibited and illustrated in the 1974 Anacostia Museum catalogue<em> The Barnett-Aden
  Collection</em> . A similar bronze casting, the same size as this head, is illustrated
  in the 1995<em> The Catalogue of the Barnett-Aden Collection</em> and dated "circa
  1973." Other bronze casts of this head are in the collection of the National Portrait

  American Art at the Savannah College of Art and Design, and the Kinsey Collection
