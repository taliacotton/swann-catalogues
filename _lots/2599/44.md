  in oil, lower right.<br><br>Provenance: private collection, Philadelphia.<br><br>Executed
  four years after Robert Neal's<em> Rearguard</em>, this early portrayal of a Black
  man in service of his nation is poised with confidence and cool. Depicted in rich
  hues of green, yellow, and red during a period when there were few African American
  soldiers in military service, Cromartie paints this figure to illuminate society's
  selective memory and to remember the often missing narratives.<br><br>Robert Cromartie
  was born in Cumberland, South Carolina, in 1929, with his family later moving to
  West Philadelphia for improved living conditions. Cromartie completed his formal
  education in the Philadelphia Public School System, graduating from West Philadelphia
  High School. He pursued his love of art by studying the subject at the college level
  for two years. In 1951, Cromartie enlisted in the United States Army and was honorably
  discharged after two years of service. Following his military service, he worked
  for the U.S. Postal Service for many years. His true passion was art, and he opened
  Cromartie's Awards in West Philadelphia, at 60th and Chestnut Streets, where he
  would work on his art and teach the trade to his many apprentices. He married Myrtle
  Jones in 1956 and they traveled throughout Africa.</p>"
