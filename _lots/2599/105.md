The color use symbolizes pan-Africanism and counteracts with the men in chains, while strengthening the image of Dr. King, Jr.<br><br>A native of Brunswick, Georgia, Pinkney moved to Southern California after serving in the U.S. Air Force. After his term of service and time in Alaska and California, he returned to Southland, CA to obtain a BFA degree from Woodbury University. Inspired by reading comic books as a child, his creativity led him to produce graphically inclined prints and murals. As a muralist, printmaker, and poet, he became a fixture in the community of Compton. In the early 1970s, he was active in the Compton Communicative Arts Academy, where he met director and artist John Outterbridge. While known as a muralist, Pinkney’s printmaking has been shown widely in galleries and museums across the country, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the California Museum of African American Art, and the San Bernardino County Museum."
