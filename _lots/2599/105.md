  of black, red, and green, featuring six Black male figures in bondage above a portrait
  of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. imposed in a spiral background. The color use symbolizes
  pan-Africanism and counteracts with the men in chains, while strengthening the image
  of Dr. King, Jr.<br><br>A native of Brunswick, Georgia, Pinkney moved to Southern
  California after serving in the U.S. Air Force. After his term of service and time
  in Alaska and California, he returned to Southland, CA to obtain a BFA degree from
  Woodbury University. Inspired by reading comic books as a child, his creativity
  led him to produce graphically inclined prints and murals. As a muralist, printmaker,
  and poet, he became a fixture in the community of Compton. In the early 1970s, he
  was active in the Compton Communicative Arts Academy, where he met director and
  artist John Outterbridge. While known primarily as a muralist, Pinkney’s printmaking
  has been shown widely in galleries and museums across the country, including the
  Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the California Museum of African American Art,
  and the San Bernardino County Museum.</p>"
