Signed in ink, lower right verso.<br><br>Provenance: acquired directly from the artist, private collection, Virginia (1994).<br><br>This charming bust by New Orleans-native sculptor, painter and muralist Willie Birch is a wonderful example of his celebrating popular forms of African American culture. Birch first began using   papier-mâché  in the mid-80s and created a series of figurative sculptures that combine Birch's fine arts background with a newfound interest in folk art. A similar pair of 1991   papier-mâché  busts,   The Couple  is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. These sculptures are in many other institutional collections including the New Orleans Museum of Art, Ogden Museum of Art, San Jose Museum of Art and Speed Museum of Art."
