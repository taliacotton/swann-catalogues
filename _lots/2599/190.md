TYPESET: "<p><em>Papier-mâché</em> and mixed media, 1990. Approximately 508x394x305
  mm; 20x15½x12 inches. Signed in ink, lower right verso.<br><br>Provenance: acquired
  directly from the artist, private collection, Virginia (1994).<br><br>This charming
  bust by New Orleans-native sculptor, painter and muralist Willie Birch is a wonderful
  example of his celebrating popular forms of African American culture. Birch first
  began using <em>papier-mâché </em>in the mid-80s and created a series of figurative
  sculptures that combine Birch's fine arts background with a newfound interest in
  folk art. A similar pair of 1991 <em>papier-mâché </em>busts, <em>The Couple</em>
  is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. These sculptures
  are in many other institutional collections including the New Orleans Museum of
  Art, Ogden Museum of Art, San Jose Museum of Art and Speed Museum of Art.</p>"
