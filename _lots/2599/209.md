  Falls Dow</em>n, a series of paintings commissioned by the Museum of Contemporary
  Art, Cleveland. She created these paintings based in part on Japanese <em>Ukiyo-e</em>
  prints from the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College, in addition to her
  experiences in a residency with Cleveland area high school students. She created
  a narrative that explored how young women get thrown "off course" by the cultural
  chaos of contemporary society. The narrative that she wove formed an elaborate story
  filled with fantastical lands, dynamic characters, and engaging plots.<br><br>iROZEALb
  (Iona Rozeal Brown) is best known for her clever merging of the imagery of Japanese
  <em>Ukiyo-e </em>prints, American hip-hop culture, and science fiction. She first
  became interested in Japanese visual culture after learning about <em>ganguro</em>,
  a phenomenon popular in Japan during the 1990s in which girls darkened their skin
  and dyed their hair blond as a challenge to ideals of beauty. Brown earned a BFA
  from the San Francisco Art Institute and an MFA from Yale University in 2002. Both
  a visual artist and DJ, who has lived in Tokyo and Yokohama, Brown currently lives
  and works in Washington, DC.</p>'
