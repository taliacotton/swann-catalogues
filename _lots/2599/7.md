  Community Art Center, Chicago (1940); private collection, Atlanta; thence by descent
  to the current owner, Georgia.<br><br>The owner's mother was gifted this work by
  Peter Pollack, the director of the Southside Community Art Center in 1940. While
  cleaning out their building's basement, she found this sculpture abandoned at 3831
  S Michigan Avenue. Previously, the home was built in 1892 for George A. Seaverns,
  Jr. and his family. In the early 20th century, as wealthy white families moved away,
  the grand house was eventually converted into apartments in the now African American
  neighborhood.<br><br>Illustrated: Samella Lewis,<em> Barthé: His Life in Ar</em>t

  Exhibition of Portraits and Sculpture by Richmond Barthé </em>, The Woman’s City

  <em>Jubilee Singer</em>, <em>Deviled Crab Man</em>, <em>Blackberry Woman</em>, <em>Black
  Narcissus</em>, <em>West Indian Venus</em> and<em> Breakaway</em> . <em>Exhibition
  of the Work of Negro Artists</em>, the Harmon Foundation, New York, February 16
  - 28, 1931.<em> Boy with a Broom</em> was one of five artworks by Barthé in his
  second showing at the Harmon Foundation; The Wisconsin Union, University of Wisconsin,
  April 7 - May 1, 1931. It included 17 artworks; one sold for $50; Women’s City Club,
  22 Park Ave, New York, June 7 - 21, 1931. It included <em>Boy With a Broom</em>
  along with several others from the earlier Harmon Foundation exhibition.<br><br><em>
  Boy with a Broom</em> is an exciting discovery - an extremely scarce example of
  a large plaster sculpture surviving from Richmond Barthé's early career. Most of
  the early plaster works from Barthé's first two Harmon Foundation exhibitions, like
  West Indian Girl , 1929 are only known today from reproductions. In 1928, Barthé
  also made a series of historical African American figures in busts including <em>Henry
  Ossawa Tanner</em> and <em>Touissant L'Ouverture</em>; from this series, <em>Paul
  Laurence Dunbar</em> and<em> Booker T. Washington</em> are now in the collection
  of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. This charming, life-size portrait was likely
  made in New York as Barthé arrived in Harlem in February of 1929 and did not return
  to Chicago until the summer of 1930. While Barthé was the toast of the town in Harlem,
  he was also preparing for his first solo exhibition sponsored by the Woman's City
  Club of Chicago planned for June of 1930. He brought back to Chicago 24 sculptures,
  six oil paintings and eight drawings, including<em> Boy with a Broom</em> . It was
  such a success that soon after Barthé successfully applied for a Rosenwald Foundation
  scholarship to return to New York.<br><br>We would like to thank art historian and
  Barthé expert Margaret Rose Vendryes for sharing her notes detailing the sculpture's
  exhibition history. Vendryes pp 39-46; Schulman p. 84.</p>"
