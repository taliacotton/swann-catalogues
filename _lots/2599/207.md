  Signed, dated and numbered 14/30 in pencil, lower margin. Printed at the Brandywine
  Workshop, Philadelphia.<br><br> <em>Negroes to Be Sold</em> parallels 18th-century
  slave advertisements, specifically one from Charleston, South Carolina, on April
  26, 1760. Thomas uses the familiar silhouettes of Shaquille O’Neal and Michael Jackson
  to portray enslaved bodies, expressing the duality of past and present as well as
