  lower right.<br><br>Provenance: the estate of the artist; thence by descent to the
  current owner, private collection.<br><br>Exhibited: Stella Jones Gallery, New Orleans,
  LA.<br><br>According to the estate, the artist''s original title for the painting
  was<em> Quandary</em> ; it was changed posthumously to <em>View From The Window
  </em>as indicated on the label.<br><br>This colorful canvas explores representation,
  and epitomizes the Surrealism found in Hughie Lee-Smith''s late-career painting.
  The compressed space, architectural elements and faceless mannequin inhabit a metaphysical,
  dream-like space and reflect the influence of Giorgio De Chirico. In the Hughie
  Lee-Smith papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Lee-Smith wrote
  in a 1988 letter to Lowery Stokes Sims, "those who exerted an extraordinary influence
  of the direction of my painting were: Steumpfig, Evergood, the Berman Brothers,
  Peter Blume, Hopper, Balthus, and particularly Giorgio De Chirico." The sun-drenched
  light and floating balloon reinforce the frozen moment, whilst the arrows illustrate
  the choices an artist has to make in defining a subject. Full of intrigue and beauty,
  <em>Quandary</em> is an excellent example of the final period of Lee-Smith''s oeuvre.</p>'
