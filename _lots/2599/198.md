  spirits by constructing assemblages that question identity, belief, gender, and
  the artistic process. Her work is informed by myths, literature, and symbols from
  Africa and the African diaspora; her African studies inspire collages composed of
  a silhouetted cacophony of shapes.<br><br>Born and raised in North Philadelphia
  and Germantown, PA, Bullock trained at the Fleisher Art Memorial from 1956-59, the
  Hussian School of Art from 1963-66, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.
  As an educator, advisor, and artist, Bullock has led classes at museums, schools,
  and prisons, including the New Jersey Council-funded Arts Horizon. She has executed
  commissions for the Philadelphia International Airport, the Robert Wood Johnson
  Foundation, SEPTA, and the Village of Arts and Humanities. Bullock has been recognized
  as a Distinguished Teaching Artist by the New Jersey State Council on the Arts in
  1997 and 2001, received a 1997 Pew Fellowship in the Arts, a Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation
  Visual Arts Residency Grant, and a Leeway Foundation Bessie Berman Grant. Her work
  is in the permanent collections of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Lafayette
  College, Philadelphia International Airport, Jane Voorhees Zimmer Art Museum, NJ,
  Rutgers State University, Leeway Foundation, Philadelphia, PA and the African American
