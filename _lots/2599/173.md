  began formal artistic training at Howard University in 1953, studying under James
  A. Porter--artist, instructor of painting and drawing, chairman of the art department
  and director of the Howard University Gallery of Art. Professor Porter published   Modern
  Negro Art  in 1943, the first comprehensive study in the United States of African
  American art. After graduation, Porter continued to advise Thompson and suggested
  she study in Germany.<br><br>Thompson developed her innovative forms of abstraction
  in printmaking and wood construction while living between Cologne and Aachen. In
