  Gilliam painted<em> First Season</em> in his first year living in Washington, DC.
  This figurative painting shows his transition towards abstraction, and is one of
  his earliest paintings to come to auction. </p><p>Gilliam completed his MA in painting
  at the University of Louisville in 1961 where he befriended painter Kenneth Victor
  Young. At the time, Gilliam was drawn to Bay Area figurative paintings - in particular,
  Nathan Oliveira and David Park. Jonathan Binstock writes, "Bay Area figuration was
  important to him because it was abstract, or at least because it represented a way
  for him to further the abstract quotient in his own work". Oliveira''s influence
  can be seen in this painting. In 1962, Gilliam moved to Washington, DC to marry
  <em>Washington Post</em> reporter Dorothy Butler. Upon the recommendation of James
  A. Porter, whom Gilliam had sought out for advice, he took a job teaching art at
  McKinley High School. The following year, Gilliam had his first one person exhibition
  at the Adams Morgan Gallery. Binstock pp. 8-12.</p>'
