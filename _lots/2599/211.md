TYPESET: "<p>Digital C-print, 2012. 1003x749 mm; 40x30 inches. Edition of 10 plus
  two AP. <br><br> <em>Boy Holding Grapes</em> is Awol Erizku's clever twist on Caravaggio’s
  <em>Young Sick Bacchus (Bacchino Malato)</em>. Dated between 1593 to 1594, <em>Young
  Sick Bacchus (Bacchino Malato</em>) indicates Caravaggio’s physical ailment involving
  malaria during his first years in Rome but depicts an alluring god of drink and
  vice. Erizku twists art history to draw attention to the lack of racial diversity
  represented in the canon and the depiction of the beauty of African Americans.<br><br>A
  photographer with a sharp eye and keen wit, Erizku observed that there weren’t many
  museum masterpieces featuring people of color and set to recreate the classics.
  “The models I choose to work with are not professional models but possess an undeniable,
  striking beauty,” declares Erizku. His practice bridges the gap between African
  and African American visual culture, referencing art history, hip hop, and universal
  human culture.<br><br>Erizku received a BFA from The Cooper Union in 2010 and a
  MFA from the Yale School of Art in 2014. He exhibited at institutions across the
  country including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Studio Museum in Harlem,
  New York. Recent solo exhibitions include New Visions for Iris , Public Art Fund,
  New York, NY and Chicago, IL, 2021; Mystic Parallax, The FLAG Art Foundation, New
  York, NY, 2020; Desire: A Revision from the 20th Century to the Digital Age, Irish
  Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, 2019. Erizku lives and works in Los Angeles.</p>"
