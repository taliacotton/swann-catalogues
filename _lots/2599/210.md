FOOTNOTE: "Digital C-print, 2009, printed in 2010. 382x508 mm; 15⅜x20 inches. Signed, titled, dated and numbered 6/20 in ink, verso.<br><br>Influenced by a two-year walking pilgrimage retracing the Transatlantic slave trade with Buddhist monks, Xaviera Simmons appears as a character in her images, posing in sublime landscapes like a mythical figure. Simmons stands majestically in a calf-high field of wheat, with a red scarf draped over her head. Arms wrapped in front of her, Simmons gazes off into the vast expanse of space. Her work is steeped in the tradition of modern American landscape painting, from early Impressionists to Realism.<br><br>Simmons’s practice spans photography, performance, video, sound, sculpture and installation. She investigates identity, abstraction, the cyclical development of landscape and humanity's interaction with it.<br><br>Simmons received a BFA from Bard College in 2004, then completed the Whitney Museum of American Art’s Independent Study Program in Studio Art in 2005 while simultaneously completing a two-year actor-training conservatory with The Maggie Flanigan Studio.<br><br>Since 2019, Simmons has been a visiting professor and lecturer as well as the inaugural Solomon Fellow at Harvard University. Her work has been included in exhibitions at ICA Boston, SFMOMA, The Phillips Collection, National Museum of Women in the Arts, and the Barnes Foundation. She is a recipient of The Charles Flint Kellogg Award in Arts and Letters from Bard College, 2020, Socrates Sculpture Park's Artist Award, 2019, Agnes Gund’s Art for Justice Award, 2018, as well as Denniston Hills’ Distinguished Performance Artist Award, 2018."
