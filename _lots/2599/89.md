  Belgium; private collection Brussels, Belgium; private collection, Boston (1995).<br><br>This
  canvas from Victor Seach is a great representation of his practice rooted in <em>composition
  géométrique</em>. Born in New York City, Seach studied at the National Academy of
  Design. He lived and worked in Harlem before serving in the Army during World War
  II in Europe. When he returned to New York City, he set up a studio in Greenwich
  Village and focused on painting abstraction. Due to a lack of support from the gallery
  scene, Seach returned to Europe in 1962 and settled in Belgium in 1971. Seach worked
  closely and exhibited with African American artists Harold Cousins and Joan Aghib,
  who were eventually dubbed the<em> Three Americans in Brussels</em>.</p>"
