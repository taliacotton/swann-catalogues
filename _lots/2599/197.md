  15 prints began with an enlargement, using offset lithography, of a woodcut plate
  from Ed. Alfred H. Guernsey and Henry M. Alden's <em>Harper's Pictorial History
  of the Civil War</em>, which was first published in Chicago in 1866. Each of these
  images was then overlaid with Walker's silhouette figures rendered with solid black
  silkscreen. This print series marked the first time Walker united her trademark
  silhouettes with the kind of historical documentation that influenced her aesthetics.</p>
