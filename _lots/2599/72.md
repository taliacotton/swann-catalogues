  private collection, New York.<br><br>This expressive figure of <em>Sojourner Truth</em>
  is a significant work by sculptor Inge Hardison. Despite a lengthy career as a sculptor
  and living to the age of 102, Hardison''s work is not widely known today beyond
  her popular series of small cast busts of historical figures <em>Negro Giants in
  History</em> in 1963 and <em>Ingenious Americans</em> in the late 1960s.<br><br>Born
  in Portsmouth, VA, Hardison''s family moved to Brooklyn in the 1930s where she pursued
  many creative interests including acting and dance. Journalist Alice Bernstein in
  her article, "Inge Hardison at 100" in the<em> International Review of African American
  Art </em>wrote how after graduating from high school, Hardison landed a role in
  the 1936 Broadway production of <em>Sweet River</em>, George Abbott’s adaptation
  of <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>, which won her rave reviews. Hardison also appeared
  in<em> The Country Wife</em> with Ruth Gordon, and in the 1946 production of <em>Anna
  Lucasta,</em> co-starring with Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee. She later attended Vassar
  College, majoring in music and creative writing, and later took art classes at the
  Arts Students League in New York. She also taught with Victor Lowenfeld at Hampton
  University from 1955-46.<br><br>Hardison made a wide range of figurative sculptures
  including several large public works such as the life-size 1957 bronze <em>Mother
  and Child</em> at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and the 7-foot abstract figure
  <em>Jubilee</em> at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn. Hardison was the only woman
  founding member of the Black Academy of Arts and Letters (BAAL), an African American
  cultural organization created in 1969 for the preservation and promotion of Black
  culture.<br><br>The original sculpture of <em>Sojourner Truth </em>was presented
  to Nelson Mandela by New York Governor Mario Cuomo in 1990. Other casts of this
  work are in the collection of the New York State Harlem Art Collection and the Belmont-Paul
  Women’s Equality National Monument of the National Woman''s Party, Washington, DC.
  Her artwork is also found today in the collections of the Princeton University Art
  Museum, the Detroit Historical Museum, and the Schomburg Center for Research in
  Black Culture, New York. iraaa.museum.hampton.edu; St. James pp. 229-30.</p>'
