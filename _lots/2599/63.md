With the artist's estate ink stamp, lower right recto, and on the stretcher bars, verso.<br><br>Provenance: the estate of the artist, with a hand-written label (and alternate title) verso; Essie Green Galleries, New York; private collection, New York.<br><br>Exhibited:   In the Spirit of Resistance: African-American Modernists & the Mexican Muralist School , traveling exhibition, 1996-98, including the Studio Museum in Harlem, October 2 - December 8, 1996.<br><br>Illustrated: Lizette LeFalle Collins.   In the Spirit of Resistance: African-American Modernists & the Mexican Muralist School , pl. 30, p. 119.<br><br>This modernist oil painting of an African American family in front of a city skyline is a large study for an unrealized mural project. As a result of his many mural commissions, Alston excelled at compositions that included multiple figures - from his celebrated 1936 WPA Harlem Hospital and 1949 Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company murals to the lesser known 1957   Our Constitution  at City College of New York. This painting is similar in its composition to the Alston's 1964 mosaic mural   Man on the Threshold of Space  for the Harriet Tubman Junior High School, PS 154 in Harlem. By 1976, Alston completed two more mosaic murals,   Equal Justice Under the Law  and   The Family of Man , for the Bronx County Family and Criminal Court buildings with more abstract figures.<br><br>The subject of this painting was also a familiar one to Alston at the time. It is part of a significant body of work, his series of   Family paintings, made in the late 1960s. Alston's important modern portrait   Family (Family #1)  in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art was painted in 1955. The next seven paintings in the series were painted between 1965-1968; Alston's   Family #3 , 1966 is also in this 30x60 inch horizontal format."
