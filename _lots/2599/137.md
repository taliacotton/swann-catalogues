  left.<br><br>Provenance: acquired from G. R. N'Namdi Gallery, Detroit; private collection,
  Michigan.<br><br>Beginning in 1983, Emma Amos diverted from traditional stretched
  canvas and started using mixed media and collage on both handwoven and printed fabric
  and paper. Her 1980s works explore African American figures in motion, from her
  1983 depictions of dancers to athletes to her 1986 <em>Falling Series</em> , which
  define the Black experience in America. <em>Highstep</em> shares its use of silhouette
  in depicting moving figures with Amos's works on canvas <em>Out in Front</em>, 1982,
  and<em> Streaks,</em> 1983, both included in the artist's recent retrospective <em>Emma
  Amos: Color Odyseey</em> . Harris pp. 113 and 116.</p>"
