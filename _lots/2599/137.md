Signed in acrylic, lower left.<br><br>Provenance: acquired from G. R. N'Namdi Gallery, Detroit, MI; private collection, Michigan.<br><br>Beginning in 1983, Emma Amos diverted from traditional stretched canvas and started using mixed media and collage on both handwoven and printed fabric and paper. Her 1980s works explore African American figures in motion, from her 1983 depictions of dancers to athletes to her 1986   Falling Series , which define the Black experience in America.   Highstep  shares its use of silhouette in depicting moving figures with Amos's works on canvas   Out in Front , 1982, and   Streaks  1983, both included in the artist's recent retrospective   Emma Amos: Color Odyseey . Harris pp. 113 and 116."
