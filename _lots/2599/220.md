Hicks works professionally as an ecommerce and marketing director. She earned a BA in business from Howard University and MBA from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Hicks has written over a dozen books on various quilt subjects, including the authoritative guide   Black Threads: An African American Quilting Sourcebook , the children’s book   Martha Ann’s Quilt for Queen Victoria  and the quilt history   This I Accomplish: Harriet Powers’ Bible Quilt and Other Pieces ."
