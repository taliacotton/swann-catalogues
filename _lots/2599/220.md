  I Count!</em> is a dynamic visual statement and beautiful artwork by quilter, art
  historian and writer Kyra Hicks, and her first art quilt to come to auction. <em>I
  Count!</em> is an excellent example of Hicks' unique expression in quilt making.
  Addressing issues of representation and expression, her works combine strong visual
  design with text and features impeccable construction. Two similar quilts of hers
  are in permanent museum collections: <em>Black Barbie</em>, 1996 at the Fenimore
  Art Museum, Cooperstown, NY and <em>Patriotic Quilt</em>, 1995 at the Museum of
  Arts and Design, New York. Her work has also been in several group exhibitions including
  at the American Craft Museum, New York, the Smithsonian Institution’s Renwick Gallery,
  Washington, DC, the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago, and the Wadsworth Atheneum,
  Hartford, CT. Hicks's quilts were the subject of a PhD dissertation by Yolanda Woods,
  <em>New World African Conjurers Who Edify and Heal the Community</em>, and the artist
  is included in <em>The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American Folklore</em>,
  vol. 2 (2006).<br><br>Born in Los Angeles, Hicks is a self-taught artist. Hicks
  works professionally as an ecommerce and marketing director. She earned a BA in
  business from Howard University and MBA from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
  The artist has transitioned from quiltmaking to writing about African American quilt
  history. Hicks has written over a dozen books on various quilt subjects, including
  the authoritative guide <em>Black Threads: An African American Quilting Sourcebook</em>,
  the children’s book <em>Martha Ann’s Quilt for Queen Victoria</em> and the quilt
  history <em>This I Accomplish: Harriet Powers’ Bible Quilt and Other Pieces.</em></p>"
