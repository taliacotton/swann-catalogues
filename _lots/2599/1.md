  Robinson Family Collection.<br><br>May Howard Jackson is one of the earliest African
  American female artists, alongside Edmonia Lewis (c. 1843 - 1912) and Meta Warrick
  Vaux Fuller (1877 - 1968). Born in the same year, Jackson and Fuller both came from
  privileged families that embraced fine art and studied at the Pennsylvania Museum
  School as well as the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Jackson won a scholarship
  to attend in 1895, the year before Fuller - becoming the first African American
  woman to attend. She married in 1902, and moved to Washington, DC, establishing
  a studio there and exhibiting at the Corcoran Gallery. In 1912, she exhibited busts
  of F. J. Reverend Grimke and W. E. B. Du Bois at the Verhoof Galleries in Washington,
  DC, which received critical acclaim. Nevertheless, she was rejected by the Washington
  Society of Fine Arts and the National Academy of Design. She later joined the faculty
  at Howard University, where she taught with James A. Porter, and continued to exhibit
  her artwork at the Harmon Foundation and the Barnett-Aden Gallery. Farrington pp.
