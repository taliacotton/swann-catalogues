(4)<br><br>This edition was published without the permission of Appleton, Engels, or the translators. The text itself was edited by Frederick Engels and translated into English by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling based on the third German edition. Although Appleton issued the first American imprint of Marx's landmark work, the sheets were leftovers from the 1887 London edition with cancelled titles, thus making this pirated Humboldt edition the first printed in the States."
