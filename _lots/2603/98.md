  Gaul follows the adventures of Amadis''s son Esplandián. He visits a mysterious
  island inhabited by griffons and fierce female warriors, and replete with riches
  called California. This popular tale entered the Spanish imagination to such an
  extent that when explorers to the Americas asked the local population about the
  existence of such a place, rumors indicated that it might actually be real. The
  rocky barren peninsula that earned the name, first believed to be an island, had
  neither a race of women fighters who fed their victims to griffons, nor swords made
  of solid gold, but we do call it California. (cf. https://amadisofgaul.blogspot.com/2009/07/california-according-to-garci-rodriguez.html)<br><br>Wing
