Although he only served as the head of the church for five years, he adopted an ambitious rebuilding project that required the destruction of antiquities and was funded by levying onerous taxes on the population. His plan saw the completion of the dome of St. Peter's; the Loggia of Sixtus in the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano; the chapel of the Praesepe in Santa Maria Maggiore; the erection of four obelisks (including the one in Saint Peter's Square); the opening of six new streets; and more."
