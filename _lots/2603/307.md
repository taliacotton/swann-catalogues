These folded paper objects often contained small coins, and served as both a certificate of blessing and as religious instruction for young children: illustrated with scenes related to the meaning of baptism, they were preserved for the child's edification when he or she reached an appropriate age. In the 18th century printers developed a gamut of formats for these delightful paper-toy documents, which are now understandably rare.\" (cf.
