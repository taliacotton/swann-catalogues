(3)<br><br>Examining the history of wealth in the Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen introduces the concepts of conspicuous leisure and conspicuous consumption for the first time. While working through capitalism's place in the development of societies and economies, he was also cognizant of the difficult positions women are forced to assume within these structures. Veblen's views are described as proto-feminist, noting that women of the industrial era were still shackled by what he describes as a \"barbarian\" status."
