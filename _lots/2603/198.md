(A copy of this publication is included in the sale of this lot.) Calendrical evidence gleaned from de Hamel's article aids in confirmation of the Carmelite attribution and date. At the opening of the text [folio 28 recto] the order is explicitly named.<br><br>\"A Carmelite friar owned very few books. Soon after joining the Order he was given a book allowance which, at the end of his novitiate, he was to spend on his basic text, a Breviary. This book contained a fuller version of the Book of Hours. If there was any money left over from the purchase of his Breviary it might be spent on other books. A mendicant friar would not have been able to possess many books. The books he did own were his for life and could not be sold, given away, or pledged, and they were recoverable on his death by the convent where he said his first Mass. From here they could be redistributed again but only to those friars who would respect the gift and keep it within their Orders.\" (see de Hamel's article cited above.)"
