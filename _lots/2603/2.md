TYPESET: "London: Charles Knight, 1732.<br><br>First edition, octavo, regular paper issue; engraved title with profile portrait of Roger Bacon (dampstain to lower margin); bound in full original publisher's moir√©-textured brown cloth boards, rebacked, 6 3/4 x 4 1/4 in.<br><br>Babbage, with his invention of the Difference Engine, a mechanical calculator designed to tabulate polynomial functions, is considered the father of modern computing. Babbage's Engine would be operated by turning a crank, which would turn a series of geared brass number wheels whose increments are dictated by the metric system, thus performing a series of calculations. One full turn of the handle accomplishes one sequence of operations. The principle at work is that of Newton's method of divided differences. Babbage did not create a working version during his lifetime, but it was successfully constructed with minor alterations by scientists in 1991. The science fiction steampunk genre also owes a debt to Babbage. Had his machine caught on in the early 19th century, one may imagine the Victorians fitted out with a panoply of sophisticated high tech gear and inventions."
