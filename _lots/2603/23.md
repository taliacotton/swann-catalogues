Keynes suggested that a cash-starved economy would continue to perpetuate the downward slide. His sustained criticism of existing economic theory carried great influence. \"I believe myself to be writing a book on economic theory which will largely revolutionize-- not I suppose, at once but in the course of the next ten years --the way the world thinks about its economic problems. I can't expect [...] anyone to believe this at the present stage. But for myself I don't merely hope what I say, in my own mind, I'm quite sure. (see John Cassidy's \"The Demand Doctor,\" The New Yorker, 3 October 2011, quoting a letter Keynes wrote to George Bernard Shaw on 1 January 1935, referring to the present work.)"
