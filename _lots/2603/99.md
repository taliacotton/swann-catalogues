It is the timeless story of the lover's quest, and tells its tale in sensual verse with thinly veiled sexual language. Gaston Paris described the work as \"an encyclopedia in disorder.\" Its popularity is without question, with approximately 300 medieval manuscript versions, and seven incunabula editions; it was always a favorite for readers, especially when illustrated.<br><br>Brunet III 1175 & Supplement I 892; Fairfax Murray French 330; Adams L-1519."
