Censorship and self-censorship led to an absence of specialized treatise and gave rise to a vast production of reference books such as textbooks and compendia written by Jesuits. Hence, Reinzer's Meterologica is apparently such a mixture of different genres because the author resorted to an emblem book as camouflage for a specialized treatise on meteorology. [...] Reinzer's publication was well informed with regard to astronomy and natural philosophy on the whole.\" (c.f. Emblems and the Natural World, ed. Karl A.E. Enekel & Paul J.
