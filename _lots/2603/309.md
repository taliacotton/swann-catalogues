  extraordinaire whose name is synonymous with fine printing, bookbinding, love of
  scholarship and sharing these arts with friends. Books in which Grolier identifies
  as, "Lugdunensis," from Lyon, are from the earliest phase of his collecting. Modern
  scholarship has surmised that he owned at least 500 books, but his generous lending
  to friends meant that some books were never returned, resulting in early dispersals
  into other collections. Etienne Roffet, son of master bookbinder Pierre Roffet,
  continued his father''s work, serving as the first official royal bookbinder for
  François I in 1539.<br><br>Adams T-670.'
