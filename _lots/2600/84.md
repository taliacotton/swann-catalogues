Days after Gettysburg, though, the battery was dispatched in pursuit of Lee's army. They camped on the Antietam battleground (10 July). At Wapping Heights on 23 July they had their first taste of combat: \"Moved forward to attact Longstreet in Manassas Gap.\" On 29 August he noted \"5 deserters shot today,\" and on 7 September the battery was reviewed by General Meade.
