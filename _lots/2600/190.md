FOOTNOTE: " A previously unknown pro-Lincoln campaign song which regards the challenger General McClellan as little more than a traitor: \"Though very small is Little Mac / Still smaller are his chances / Let English Tories in our streets / Abuse our Land and Freedom / We'll treat Old Foes to New defeats / Nor will the Yankees heed 'em.\" The final verse predicts that \"Mac will find on 'lection day . . . that helping Rebels will not pay.\" The author regards the defeat of slavery as the main cause and objective of the war, and name-checks military leaders Farragut, Sherman, Sheridan and Grant in addition to \"Abraham.\" The words were meant to be sung to the tune of Yankee Doodle, which you may find increases your enjoyment. <BR><BR>We can trace no other references to this song, either by its title or by its first line, \"Secession's Friends must clear the track / the Union Host advances.\"  "
