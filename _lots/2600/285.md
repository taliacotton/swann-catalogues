FOOTNOTE: " This is an 1867 translation of an 1835 grant of one league of land, made by the Mexican state of Coahuila and Texas to settler Adolphus Sterne (1801-1852). Sterne was an important early settler of Texas who resisted the Mexican government as early as the 1825 Fredonian Rebellion, was a friend of Sam Houston, served as a militia commander, and had a seat in the legislature for Nacogdoches. This translation was commissioned in 1867, long after his death. The plat map was drawn and signed by James Harper Starr of Nacogdoches, who had been treasurer of the Republic of Texas, was a Confederate official, and then operated one of the first banks in Texas. He presumably traced the map from the original in the Mexican land records.  "
