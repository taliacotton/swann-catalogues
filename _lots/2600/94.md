FOOTNOTE: " One of the more memorable American bookplates of the early Federal period. It lists 5 laws for library borrowers: late fees, \"one penny for folding down a leaf,\" \"other damages as apprais'd by a committee,\" and more. A 4-line poem appears at bottom, promising great rewards to the young seeker of wisdom. An eager youth is depicted standing before a bookshelf, guided by the allegorical figures of Wisdom, Virtue, and Honour. 3 pages are devoted to this plate in Allen & Hewins, The American Book-Plate, pages 62-64. <BR><BR>The engraver Martin Bull (1744-1825) was a Farmington goldsmith, gunpowder manufacturer, church deacon, probate clerk, and treasurer. This bookplate was his best-known work as an engraver. The library assumed this name in January 1801, when Bull served as chairman of its committee, so he likely engraved the bookplate shortly afterward. See Julius Gay, \"An Historical Address Delivered at the Opening of the Village Library of Farmington,\" page 12.  "
