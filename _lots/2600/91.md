FOOTNOTE: ' "Many straglers who had taken too much apple jack straggled away from
  regiment and were captured by girillas.” <BR><BR>John Scowcroft Settle (circa 1839-1917)
  was born in England and came with his parents to the Frankford neighborhood of Philadelphia
  as a boy. He enlisted in the 121st Pennsylvania Infantry in August 1862; the regiment
  saw heavy fighting at Fredericksburg, Gettysburg and the siege of Petersburg, all
  described in his diaries. The entries are mostly short and of modest literary quality,
  but his humor and poetic nature shine through in spots--and he was a witness to
  history. <BR><BR>The first diary begins shortly after the regiment was mustered,
  in September 1862. On 30 October he wrote "Thus began our Va campaign under Gen’l
  Burnside. I only hope it may be successful.” Their first taste of combat was at
  Fredericksburg, where he wrote "the Rebels gave us shot and shell in front of the
  Reb batteries, many a gallant soldier fell" (13 December). For four days in January
  he noted Burnside''s abortive offensive against Richmond, the infamous Mud March--or
  as Settle wrote on 20 January 1863, “Marched on what is called the Mud Skedadle."
  He briefly describes his movements at Chancellorsville from 20 April to 4 May, and
  then to start July he describes the Battle of Gettysburg: "Came off picket, the
  battle commenced about 1 mile from Gettysberg. The Rebs drove us about 1 mile on
  the 1st day. I was wounded in the left arm and right shoulder but not bad. . . .
  Our forces drove the enemy at all points and many prisoners taken. . . .Our men
  re-took Gettysburg.” Left for a Philadelphia hospital shortly after the battle,
  where he continued with sporadic entries through May 1864. <BR><BR>Settle''s second
  diary begins in September 1864, when he is released from the hospital and returns
  to his regiment, then engaged in the Siege of Petersburg. On 30 September and 1
  October he describes the related Battle of Peebles''s Farm: "Our First Division
  captured a fort. We then advanced and threw up breastworks. . . . Early the Rebs
  moved on and drove our brigade from behind the breastworks. We then went to the
  rear and threw up others.” He served as a clerk for the regiment''s participation
  in the presidential election on 11 October, and records a strong showing for the
  "Union" over the Democrats. At the Battle of Boydton Plank Road, “Moved at 4 a.m.
  and were engaged with the Rebs at 3 p.m. We got lost with firing on every side,
  battalion of sharpshooters capt[ured]" (28 October). A raid to destroy Confederate
  transportation and supplies concluded on 10 December: "The 2nd Brigade in the rear
  charged by girillas. 14 girillas killed by charging on the cavalry through brigade.
  Barnes, houses, hay stacks and churches destroyed by our troops but destroying the
  church was condemned by all. Many straglers who had taken too much apple jack straggled
  away from regiment and were captured by girillas.” <BR><BR>Settle suffered his second
  wound at the Battle of Hatcher''s Run on 6 February 1865: "At 1 p.m. engaged the
  rebels, they driving our 1 Brigade, ours charged on them and drove them back, but
  not without heavy loss on our side. We ware finally driven back to the breastworks
  and they checked the enemy. I received a slight wound on the arm and went to the
  rear. The same ball struck my hatchet and glanced and passed through my cap.” He
  was back on picket the next day, and fought at the pivotal Battle of Fort Stedman
  on 26 March, where he noted a "truce of 3 hrs for the parties to bury their dead
  wich are about equal in numbers.” After that, the rebels were on the run. On 9 April,
  he writes “Reported surrender of Lee’s army. Ours drawn up in line of battle. All
  kinds of reports, not knowing wich is the right one. Capture of an ammense number
  of prisoners.” The leaf which must have noted Lincoln''s assassination is missing;
  the diary concludes shortly after the Grand Review of 23 May. This second diary
  also includes two pages of primitive drawings of corps flags in Meade’s Army of
  the Potomac, as well as his division''s and brigade''s flags; and also a two-page
  song titled “Happy Land of Canaan,” apparently unpublished, commenting on the start
  of the war. <BR><BR>The diaries contain frequent mention of letters to or from Alice;
  John and Alice married in 1865 not long after he mustered out. They raised a large
  family in Leeds, MD, where he ran a general store. Included with Settle''s Civil
  War diary are a small collection of personal papers: <BR><BR>His letter to future
  wife Alice. "I suppose you begin to think by my former letters that I was begining
  to be a secesh . . . decived by our generals &c was enough to make us so, but with
  good treatment we are begining to be as patriotic as ever. Old Joe Hooker is making
  us all into regulars, blackened shoes &c. . . The change is for the better. Every
  one thinks Old Joe is going to win." 4 pages; dampstaining. Belle Plain, VA, 1 April
  1863. <BR><BR>Four versions of Settle''s poem "The Frankford Boys" recounting his
  company''s achievements at Gettysburg and elsewhere. It begins "All honor to the
  loyal boys / That wore the Union blue" and each verse ends with "The Frankford boys
  were there." Present are a clipping of a newspaper publication dated 13 December
  1909; a partial typescript dated 1911; a manuscript dated 1915; and an undated typescript.
  <BR><BR>An incomplete post-1890 pension application in Settle''s name citing "gunshot
  wound of left fore-arm, general debility and debility naturally due to age." <BR><BR>A
  carte-de-visite portrait of Settle''s grandfather(?) John Scowcroft of Harwood,
  England. <BR><BR>Settle''s 1860 pocket diary signed in Manayunk, PA. The entries
  are mostly brief and of little consequence. On 20 March he attended a debate at
  his local lyceum: "Question debated was, Has a state a right to secede from the
  Union?" At least one entry was added in 1861, noting the Battle of Port Royal on
  15 November. <BR><BR>"History of the 121st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers by the
  Survivors'' Association." 292 pages; moderate wear. Private Settle is listed on
  page 281; he has inscribed the volume on the flyleaf. Philadelphia, 1893. <BR><BR>Finally,
  a sixth-plate cased ambrotype portrait (3¼ x 2¾ inches) in strong condition of a
  young man, presumed to be Settle, holding an American flag. He wears a ribboned
  beret and has another ribbon on his breast. <BR><BR>These diaries and the related
  papers offer a portrait of a patriotic humble soldier with an edge of sarcasm. They
  are apparently unpublished and unrecorded. Additional notes on the diaries are available
  upon request.  '
