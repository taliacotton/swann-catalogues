DESCRIPT: "(CIVIL WAR--CONFEDERATE.)"
CROSSHEAD: "Manuscript pledge by the citizens of Burnet County to care for the families of Confederate soldiers."
at-a-glance: "Burnet, TX, December 1861"
TYPESET: "Manuscript signed by 34 county residents, the first 17 in pencil and the remainder in ink. One page, 13¾ x 8¼ inches, plus integral blank docketed \"Guaranty to aid soldiers' families\"; horizontal folds, moderate foxing and light staining."
FOOTNOTE: " \"We, the undersigned citizens of Burnet County, pledge ourselves that the families of all those who enlist and go into the service of the country in the existing war from Burnet County, shall be taken care of, and we pledge ourselves that the said families shall be provided with the necessaries of life during the absence of the husband or father, as the case may be, in the service of the country.\"<BR><BR>As you might expect, most of the signers we are able to trace were prosperous ranchers who were past fighting age but still wanted to show their support for the Confederate cause. For example, C.C.C. Kavanaugh and Thomas W. Hunt were neighbors aged 50 and 41 in the 1860 census, each engaged in stock raising and worth more than $4,000. This pledge appears to be unpublished.  "
