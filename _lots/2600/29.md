FOOTNOTE: " The bold aviator shown here was Eugene Burton Ely (1886-1911), launching his Curtiss Model D (the \"Curtiss Pusher\") from an improvised wooden ramp on the deck of the USS Birmingham. As seen here, the plane dipped the moment it left the ramp; its landing gear splashed through the water before he was able to regain some altitude and land safely on a nearby beach. This was the first airplane to take off from a ship, ushering in the age of aircraft carriers. <BR><BR>Ely was a civilian stunt pilot; two months later he succeeded in landing the Pusher on the USS Pennsylvania in the first successful shipboard landing. A crash in an October 1911 air show ended his life; he was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his pioneering aircraft carrier flights.  "
