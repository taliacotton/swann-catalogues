FOOTNOTE: " Cosme Bueno (1711-1798) was a physician and historian who published an annual almanac in Lima, \"El Conocimiento de los Tiempos,\" from 1757 to 1798. This longer historical work began appearing in serialized form in his almanacs in the 1760s, but was published in book form in very small numbers, if at all. It \ndescribes parts of La Plata in what are now Chile, Bolivia, Perú, Argentina, and Paraguay, covering geography, climate, population, and religious activity. It was apparently circulated in manuscript form, and finally appeared in proper printed editions in 1902 and 1996. <BR><BR>The book (if there was one) was not recorded by Medina. Palau lists \"Descripcion de las Provincias del Perú\" as a 1763 Lima imprint in octavo, but with no other details (36683). OCLC lists one copy of \"Descripción geografica de las Provincias pertenecientes al Reyno del Perú, Chile y Rio de la Plata\" at the National Library of Chile, in [525] pages, with a title page in red and black, but it is not entirely clear whether this might be a manuscript. At least one similarly titled manuscript by Bueno has appeared on the market. The dealer Kraus sold a 42-leaf \"Descripcion del Obispado de Buenos Ayres\" in 1957, said to come from the papers of Juan Vincente, Conde de Revilla-Gigedo, Viceroy of Mexico (1789-1794); it later appeared at Sotheby's in 1966.
