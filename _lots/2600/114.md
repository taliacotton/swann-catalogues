The rounded 1883-1884 number, 350,000 barrels, appears to be projected. The contents are lively: a \"Message to our Patrons,\" a display of counterfeit labels, illustrations of satellite breweries in Arkansas, Wyoming and Texas; a centerfold spread of their 1883 gold medal certificate; and a 3-page price list for their various brews: Anheuser-Busch Standard, Liebotschaner, Erlanger, Pale Lager, Faust Beer, and \"the Budweiser beer,\" offered by the bottle or keg. Souvenir traveling cases, beer glasses, and corkscrews are also offered. Romaine, American Trade Catalogs, lists the earliest known American brewery catalog as being a price list and trade circular from Anheuser Busch in 1885 (page 21).
