FOOTNOTE: " Trevett v. Weeden was an influential Rhode Island Supreme Court decision. The state's General Assembly had passed laws mandating that paper currency be accepted as legal tender, with offenders not granted a jury trial or right of appeal. The laws were in direct contradiction to the state's own constitution. In this case, a butcher named Weeden was charged with refusing the inflationary paper currency, and was represented by United States Congressman (and Continental Army general) James Mitchell Varnum, who convinced the court to refuse to enforce the unconstitutional legislation. This case was later cited as precedent in the 1803 United States Supreme Court case Marbury v. Madison, which established the principle of judicial review. See Kurt Graham, \"To Bring Law Home: The Federal Judiciary in Early National Rhode Island,\" pages 24-27. Alden, Rhode Island 1105; Evans 20825; Sabin 98638.  "
