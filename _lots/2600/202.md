FOOTNOTE: " This date first came into the public consciousness on 18 December 2020, when President Trump announced \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\" On 1 January 2021, Women for America First obtained a permit for a rally with an estimated attendance of 5,000 on First Amendment (free speech) grounds. <BR><BR>In preparation for the rally, these parking notices were affixed to utility poles in the rally area. This example was posted on 7th Street where it meets the north end of the National Mall, about halfway between the Washington Monument and the Capitol building. It restricts parking along several blocks of 7th Street \"from Independence Avenue SW to E Street NW.\" The reason for the restriction is given as \"First Amendment Activity.\" <BR><BR>On 6 January 2021, at about noon, President Trump gave a speech on the Ellipse, assuring his supporters that he would never concede the election, and urging them: \"We fight. We fight like Hell and if you don't fight like Hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" They then marched east along the Mall, passing this sign, to the Capitol building where the certification of the Electoral College results was taking place. Exactly what happened next is still a matter of public and legal debate. <BR><BR>Approximately 4 days after the attack, our consignor salvaged this rain-dampened sign.  "
