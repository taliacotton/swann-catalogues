FOOTNOTE: " The brig Young America was a merchant vessel which sailed out of Plymouth, MA from at least 1856 to 1863. David Vining Pool (1823-1884) of Plymouth took command as master in 1857. On this 1862 voyage, the Young America sailed from Cardiff, Wales, arrived in Malta on 22 March, and sailed on to Palermo, Italy a week later, per the New York Daily Herald of 17 April 1862. Malta was at that point a protectorate in the British Empire; the British flag can be seen flying at the fortress in the background. Although the two nations remained major trade partners, relations between the United States and Great Britain were tense at that point because of the crown's flirtation with recognition of the Confederacy. <BR><BR>Historical context aside, this unattributed painting is an attractive image, with the ship's name and the American flag giving it a strong patriotic flair.
