FOOTNOTE: " This notebook traces the extensive land holdings of Morris and Pheobus Freudenthal in the Refugio Grant, located near Anthony, NM just north of El Paso, TX. The cover and title page state that these are field notes made for the Freudenthals by United States Deputy Surveyors Garrett, Nichols & Woodson in 1888. The notes trace dozens of tracts, describing not only property lines but other distinguishing features: \"Enter thick growth of willows,\" \"Some of this land is low and grown up with a coarse cane-like grass.\" The Freudenthals made extensive additional notes in the volume in various hands, tracing land sales through at least 1901, often in impressionistic notes, such as \"Olguin took Juan Garcia land\" near the end of the volume. Names of neighboring property owners and purchasers are often noted, the bulk of them Spanish. <BR><BR>Brothers Morris Freudenthal (1853-1921) and Pheobus Freudenthal (1854-1922) of Las Cruces were members of one of the pioneer Jewish families of the Mesilla Valley, their uncle Louis having arrived circa 1850.
