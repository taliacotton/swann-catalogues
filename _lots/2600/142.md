FOOTNOTE: ' The sculptor Max Bachmann (1862-1921) has a wide-ranging body of work,
  but his various depictions of Lincoln were probably his best known, including a
  statue in Minneapolis, MN. Some of his works were marketed by the Caproni Gallery
  of Boston. The source image for this beardless bust may have been a 1 October 1858
  ambrotype by Calvin Jackson taken in Pittsfield, IL a couple of weeks before the
  final Lincoln-Douglas debate (Ostendorf O-10). See Leigh Henson, "Max Bachman''s
