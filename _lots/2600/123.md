FOOTNOTE: " First American edition. Thomas Dibdin's 1798 English farce \"The Jew and the Doctor\" was part of a trend toward more sympathetic portrayals of Jewish protagonists at the turn of the 18th century. The heavily accented dialect in this song from the play is broadly drawn, but the caricature of the money lender ends on a positive note: \"I loves de Christians dearly would dee to pleasur you / If you but as sencerly vill try to lofe de Jew.\" Sonneck-Upton, page 217. 3 copies in OCLC, and none traced at auction.
