FOOTNOTE: " Second edition. The Jesuit Francisco de Florencia (1619–1695) was the first Florida-born author. Here he describes an apparition which appeared in 1631 to an Indian named Diego Lázaro de San Francisco who lived on the Puebla–Tlaxcala border in Mexico. Miracles are recounted, and a full-page woodcut of St. Michael appears on the verso of the title page. A few lines in Nahuatl can be found on page 119. European Americana 740/121; Medina, BHA 6467; Palau 92347; Sabin 24815. The preliminaries are carried over from the 1692 Lopez de Haro first edition, dated 1690 and 1692, but European Americana places this Siete Revueltas edition as circa 1740.
