In addition, this was one of the first broadsides to style Massachusetts a commonwealth rather than a state, in keeping with the 25 October passage of their new constitution. Ford lists only one earlier Commonwealth broadside, issued 12 days earlier on 13 November. Provenance: purchased on 21 January 1955 from dealer S.C. Hamilton per a pencil note on verso.  "
