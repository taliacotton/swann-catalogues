They were met by a mob of secessionist civilians hurling bricks, and barely escaped. Here a Black man is shown in the foreground among the angry insurrectionists, which seems unlikely. Nick Biddle, a Black man with a Pennsylvania militia company, is thought to have been the first man wounded that day. <BR><BR>None traced at auction or in OCLC, though copies are held by Connecticut Historical Society and the Maryland Center for History and Culture.
