DESCRIPT: "(MEXICAN COOKERY.)"
CROSSHEAD: "Group of manuscript Mexico cookbooks and fragments."
at-a-glance: "Mexico and possibly elsewhere, circa 1840-1900"
TYPESET: "19 manuscript items in different hands, ranging from fragmentary segments of leaves to complete manuscript cookbooks; condition varies."
FOOTNOTE: " The most substantial item here is a 20-page manuscript titled simply \"Cocinero.\" It begins with several desserts and moves into more savory dishes. One typically Mexican recipe is for Chilpotles Escabechados (page 10). On hand-lined paper, it appears to date from the late 19th century. Three other multi-page gatherings are possibly complete although they lack titles. A crudely hand-stitched 18-page gathering has a mid-19th century look and recipes such as Escabeche de Veracruz and Ensalada de Jicama. A 12-page unbound manuscript which starts with Otros Estofado includes recipes for Pollos en Orchata and Mole Genoves; one leaf bears a watermark reading \"Guise Testa\" which seems to date from circa 1840. Among the smaller fragments are a recipe for Sopa de Tortillas, and 3 pages of recipes including Chicharos con Ejote en Xitomate bearing the inked stamp of Manuel Prieto Gonz√°lez.  "
