FOOTNOTE: " This poster from the very early years of commercial motion pictures advertises an exhibition of \"life-size views of life and motion . . . illustrating our new possessions and Free Cuba,\" in the wake of the Spanish-American War. An \"Optigraph Moving Picture Machine\" projected animated pictures on a screen, interspersed with 52 still views projected with the more established stereopticon technology. The Philippines, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico are all featured. <BR><BR>It might seem odd that Sears & Roebuck would be publishing an exhibition broadside. They produced and marketed early film projectors and films, with independent exhibitors as their intended audience, promising that \"you have no boss or bosses, you conduct the business to suit yourself.\" See David Nasaw's 1999 book \"Going Out: The Rise and Fall of Public Amusements\" (page 142). The posters were apparently produced to accompany the projectors so exhibitors could start advertising their performances without delay. The first reference we find to an actual performance was in the Chadron Record in rural Nebraska, 21 July 1899: \"A right royal entertainment is promised to be given in Nelson's opera house tomorrow night when the wonderful animated or moving picture exhibition will be given.\" None traced at auction since 2005.
