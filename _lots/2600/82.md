FOOTNOTE: " The Ninth Regiment of the New York State Militia served in the Army of Virginia, and was later designated the 83rd New York Infantry. This regimental newspaper was issued from a seized printing press in newly captured Warrenton in northern Virginia, using paper shipped in from Washington. It features a long poem on the battle of Bunker's Hill, a glowing description of the occupied town (although \"our reception by the inhabitants has not thus far been as cordial as we could wish\"), and notes that the soldiers have renewed interest in their grooming upon to exposure to \"the bright eyes of Warrenton's fair Traiteresses.\" An article describes efforts to employ \"twenty or thirty Negroes\" on a street-cleaning project. <BR><BR>Issue 2 was published on 7 August, but no others have been traced--the regiment soon became otherwise engaged in the Northern Virginia Campaign. In the next few months, they suffered many fatalities in the Second Battle of Bull Run, Antietam and Fredericksburg. Only one other traced at auction (Swann, 22 March 2007).  "
