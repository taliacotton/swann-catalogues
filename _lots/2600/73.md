FOOTNOTE: " This run includes most of the issues from 1 May to 19 July 1861, as well as 3 later issues from September and December 1861. It begins during the aftermath of Fort Sumter and Baltimore's bloody Pratt Street riots. The 13 May issue reports the Confederate declaration of war; 14 May reports the Federal occupation of Baltimore under Benjamin Butler. The 27 May issue reports the arrest of secessionist militiaman John Merriman, which caused \"quite an excitement\"; the legality of his imprisonment was the subject of an important Supreme Court case. The impending dread of a border state on the eve of a bloody war is felt throughout.  "
