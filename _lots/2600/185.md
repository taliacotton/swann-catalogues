FOOTNOTE: " An advertisement for an ephemeral early photo studio at Hyannis on Cape Cod, for which no other record has been traced. \"Mr. A.G. Nye, having disposed of is Saloon at No. 62 Milk-st., Boston, begs leave to inform his Hyannis friends and the public generally, that he has constructed a Saloon . . . adapted to taking Photographic Miniatures. . . . As regards the new process . . . he has practiced it for six years, and the new process of coloring (which is by use of the pencil) he has practiced for sixteen years--six years before the photographic art was discovered. . . . His spacious Hall, or Saloon, will arrive at Hyannis in a few days.\" <BR><BR>The little-known photographer Alexander Gibbs Nye (1817-1901) was born in Falmouth on Cape Cod, MA. He was at a studio at 62 Milk Street in Boston when reviewed by The Symbol (an Odd Fellows magazine) on 1 February 1844. A June 1846 flier held at Yale University places Nye in Plymouth, MA. An advertisement for selling his daguerrean apparatus ran in the Daily Chronotype of Boston from February 23 to 26, 1847. The 1850 census places him in Plymouth as a painter, and from 1855 until his death he was in Weymouth, MA, where he became a dentist. From this chronology, we suspect this broadside was issued circa 1845. <BR><BR>None traced in OCLC or at auction.  "
