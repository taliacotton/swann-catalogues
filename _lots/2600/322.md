FOOTNOTE: " The Imperial Order of Guadalupe was created as an official honor for the citizens of Mexico. It had three short periods of use: during the reign of Emperor Agustin I, 1822-1823; for a few months under Santa Anna in 1854; and finally from 1863 to 1867 under Emperor Maximilian I. This certificate names Pedro Cabazos of Matamoros as a Caballero (Knight) within the order. In addition to Maximilian's bold signature, the signature of Juan Almonte (1803-1869) is notable for his close association with Santa Anna, and his important role in the Battle of the Alamo.  "
