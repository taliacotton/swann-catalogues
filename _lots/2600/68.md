The presenter named here was Pinkey M.E. Biggs (born 1824), a Baltimore seamstress. She had them printed for distribution at a Confederate memorial service at Loudon Park Cemetery near Baltimore, as reported in the Baltimore Sun of 11 June 1874. The poem appeared in print as early as 1867 in \"Southern Poems of the War\" edited by Emily Mason, so Biggs was apparently not the author. We trace no other examples of this printing.

Lafferty, who died in 1909, explains that a tree planted on the grave in 1864 was removed in 1884, and \"the roots had gone directly to the coffin and embraced by curious curves and bendings the body of the dead Champion of the South.\" The present fragment is said to be \"made from wood nourished by the mighty dead, and holding in its fibers the dust of the matchless hero.\" The card was printed \"with compliments of James Z. McChesney, Charlestown, WV,\" a commander in the United Confederate Veterans.
