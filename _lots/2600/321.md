FOOTNOTE: " These papers all relate to the estate of a family with mining interests in Aguascaliente and Bolaños. The principals are Augustina Velázquez, who died in 1780; her husband Antonio Vivanco y Gutierrez (1727-1799), a wealthy mine owner who was made Marqués de Vivanco in 1791 for his service in the Bolaños militia; and their son Antonio Guadalupe Vivanco de Velásquez (1778-1800), the second Marques, who died young, leaving a widow, an infant daughter and a complex estate situation. This packet includes: <BR><BR>[121] manuscript leaves, including dozens of receipts of various sizes, bound together. Various places, 1780-1782. Augustina Velázquez's will ordered that numerous masses were read in her name in her home region, with priests signing receipts for the payments. One intriguing entry is a receipt for donations signed by 20 priests, including \"Br. Hidalgo\"--an early signature of Miguel Hidalgo (1753-1811). He had been ordained as a priest in 1773, and much later was a leader in the Mexican war of independence. During this period he was at the Colegio de San Nicolás Obispo in what is now Morelia. The initial \"H\" evolved in his later signatures, but the remainder is a close match. <BR><BR>\"Testimonio de los autos de inventarios formados a los bienes que quedaor por muerte del Señor Don Antonio Vivanco, Marques de Vivanco.\" [1], 99, [1] leaves in a consistent hand.
