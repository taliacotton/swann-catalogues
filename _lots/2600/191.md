FOOTNOTE: " Andrew Johnson only assumed the presidency due to tragedy, spent most of his term embroiled in controversy, and did not seek re-election. Thus, not many elaborate engravings featuring his image were ever produced. This is one of the few exceptions. A huge image of President Johnson is surrounded by 17 smaller portraits of Union generals, admirals, and cabinet members, and other patriotic motifs. One example in OCLC, at Indiana Historical Society.  "
