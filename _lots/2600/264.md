DESCRIPT: "(WEST--COLORADO.) William Henry Jackson."
CROSSHEAD: "Album of photographs in decorative \"Denver\" covers."
at-a-glance: "Denver, CO, circa 1882"
TYPESET: "15 albumen photographs (9 of them about 4¼ x 6½ inches; the other 6 being 3½ x 3 inches), on 12 original card mounts with red-lined borders. Oblong 8vo decorative gilt cloth covers with gilt morocco cover label \"Denver\" and \"W.H Jackson & Co., Denver\" gilt-stamped below, backstrip faded and worn, tape repair to inner hinge, otherwise minor wear; most of the cards detached from the binding, occasional foxing and minor wear."
FOOTNOTE: " The photographs are mounted accordion-style, but in three sections. The first three are a continuous \"Panorama of Denver,\" with the first card being laid down to the inner binding. The bulk of the images are on 8 cards folded to fit neatly in the binding, but are detached. They include views of Larimer Street, 16th Street, the Windsor Hotel, Tabor Block, Tabor Grand Opera House, St. John's Cathedral, Union Depot, and more. The images of City Hall and the Court House are actually photographs of architectural renderings, suggesting that the album was compiled shortly before the Court House was completed in January 1883. Finally, a view of the residence of Senator Nathaniel P. Hill is mounted on a card in the same format, but is detached from the others; it has minor wear to the image.  "
