FOOTNOTE: " This poster's title is a paraphrase of Wilson's 18 August 1914 statement of neutrality as Europe went to war. It is juxtaposed with a quote from Abraham Lincoln, \"With malice toward none, with charity for all.\" The black, white and red flag of the German Empire is behind the American shield to the right, suggesting a \"why can't we all just get along\" sentiment which did not age well. This poster was printed for the Santa Cruz Surf daily newspaper (quite possibly as a magazine centerfold or subscriber premium) by Edwards & Deutsch of Chicago. No others traced in OCLC or elsewhere.  "
