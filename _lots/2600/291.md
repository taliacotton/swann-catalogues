CROSSHEAD: "Pair of Real Photo postcards depicting \"The Hatfield section of West Va.\""
at-a-glance: "West Virginia, 1907"
TYPESET: "Pair of postcards, each 3¾ x 5¼ inches, inscribed in image on recto, with address, canceled stamps, and Eckman, WV postmarks dated 11 April 1907 on verso; minimal wear."
FOOTNOTE: " These two postcards depict an impoverished but well-armed West Virginia family. The sender has inscribed the seated portrait: \"This house is in the territory I travel. It is in the Hatfield section of WVa. Every member of the family carries a gun. This picture was taken last summer by a traveling man.\" The other photo, depicting the family riding upon two oxen, is inscribed \"Come out to West Va. and I will take you for a ride. This is the way they travel out here.\" The postcards were postmarked in Eckman, WV, perhaps 30 miles southeast of Hatfield territory, and mailed to a friend in Roanoke, VA. <BR><BR>We have not ascertained whether this family actually belonged to the famed Hatfields, or which members might be depicted. West Virginia University holds a colorized version of the postcard captioned \"Typical Mountain Home and Family, Wyoming County, W. Va.\"--an area east of Hatfield country, but not far from where the present postcards were mailed. Our correspondent was not the only one to draw a line from this image to the Hatfields, though. The colorized postcard was used as the lead image in a PBS American Experience video, \"How the Newspapers Covered the Hatfield-McCoy Feud.\"  "
