FOOTNOTE: " Warns of politicians who promise an easy peace with the Confederacy, and shares the recent punishing peace demands issued by the Richmond Enquirer. Concludes: \"Comrades! Vote for the party that stands by the government, and vote for the men who stand by us, and by our brave brothers in the field, and let the ballot box tell the story of your patriotism.\" Attributed to Sinclair Tousey as part of his series of anti-Copperhead broadsides issued in the wake of the July 1863 draft riots; another undated version bears the imprint of his Loyal Publication Society. Other similar broadsides with the same title are undated, but were apparently issued later. We trace none of this dated broadside at auction since 1948.  "
