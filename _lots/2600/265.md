DESCRIPT: "(WEST--COLORADO.) George E. Mellen, photographer."
CROSSHEAD: "Colorado Views."
at-a-glance: "No place, 1885 and undated"
TYPESET: "12 albumen photographs (each about 4¼ x 7¼ inches), laid down on stiff folding linen in accordion style as issued, each captioned in the negative, one of them signed by Mellen in the negative and the others in the same size and format. Between 2 original identical decorative cloth boards titled \"Colorado Views,\" minor wear and dampstaining; minimal wear and foxing to contents."
FOOTNOTE: " Few of these images can be readily traced elsewhere. The one credited image here, \"Tanglefoot Curve, Cumbres Pass,\" has a George E. Mellen signature in the negative--but is credited in the History Colorado Online Collection to William H. Jackson. Mellen and Jackson were collaborators. We assume the remainder of the images are by Mellen, although it is impossible to be sure. Another image, \"Gateway to Royal Gorge D.&R.G.R.R. 2000 Ft. High,\" is credited to \"W. H. L. & Co.\" by the Amon Carter Museum. Others include the Veta Pass (with passengers posed on the train), Tomichi Creek, Castle Gate (in Utah), the Garfield Monument at Toltec Tunnel, and Palmer Lake and Station. All relate to the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad. We trace no other examples of this compilation.  "
