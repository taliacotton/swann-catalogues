FOOTNOTE: " A view of the sprawling Union Army hospital in Portsmouth, RI, which treated thousands of wounded soldiers from 1862 to 1865. One in OCLC, at the American Antiquarian Society, and none others traced at auction. <BR><BR>The steamer Perry, featured prominently near the center of this view, ran a regular passenger route along Narragansett Bay between Providence and Newport. Its engineer Charles Lewis Stanhope, whose name is printed on the receipt, had a colorful history. In 1862 and 1864 he had violent altercations with passengers who were unable to pay their fares; both won lawsuits. He later served on an illegal gun-running expedition to Haiti. In 1871 he married Carrie Clark, but they were soon separated. She became linked with star baseball pitcher Charles \"Old Hoss\" Radbourn by 1884, and they were married in 1895. Stanhope died in the Rhode Island State Hospital for the Insane in 1898. This may be more than you care to know about Charles L. Stanhope.  "
