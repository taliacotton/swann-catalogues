FOOTNOTE: " This club of elite Bostonians was formed to take advantage of equestrian opportunities among the Fenway, Boston's new scenic parkway which fully opened in 1893. A commodious club hall and stable was built on Hemenway Street near the Fenway (now the home of the Badminton and Tennis Club). <BR><BR>The front of this volume has the minutes of the club's organizational and annual meetings, as well as the by-laws. 7 printed annual financial statements, 4 printed meeting notices, and two original meeting petitions signed by the membership are laid down. Member T. Jefferson Coolidge, United States Minister to France, signed both petitions. Minutes of the club's more extensive Governors meetings appear at the rear of the volume. Approximately 100 membership nomination slips and other membership materials are tipped in or laid into this section. John Quincy Adams II (1833-1894) and Thomas Bailey Aldrich also appear on the membership rolls. A small number of women were elected to membership. The 28 October 1896 minutes discuss the case of Miss Martha Parsons, who had gained access to the club through her brother's membership at a \"time when membership by ladies was expected to be rare and not viewed favorably\"; she was granted membership.
