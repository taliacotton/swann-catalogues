FOOTNOTE: " Simon Bolivar was already the president and founding hero of Gran Colombia in August of 1828. After a failed constitutional convention left the young nation on the brink of chaos, Bolivar declared himself dictator through the Decreto Organico (Organic Decree) of 27 August 1828. This proclamation was issued on the same day as the famous decree. Under the heading \"Simon Bolivar, Libertador Presidente de Colombia &&&,\" It begins \"Colombianos! Las voluntades publicas se habian espresado enerjicamente por las reformas politicas de la nacion.\" Bolivar explains why he has found it necessary to assume these extraordinary powers. He also assures his countrymen that he will not remain a dictator any longer than necessary, but in the meantime pledges to \"commit myself to strictly obey your legitimate desires\" (\"obligo a obedecer estrictamente vuestros lejitimos deseos\") and to \"protect your sacred religion as the faith of all Colombians and the code of all good men; I will make justice the first law of all transactions and the universal guarantee of our citizens. . . . I will not say anything to you about liberty because if I fulfill my promises you will be more than free--you will be respected.” It is signed in type \"Bolivar\" as president of Gran Colombia.
