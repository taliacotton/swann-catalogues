FOOTNOTE: " Project MKUltra was an extremely controversial covert Central Intelligence Agency program which ran from 1953 to 1973, attempting to develop new techniques for brainwashing and torture. Most memorably, agents delivered high doses of LSD to unwitting or coerced participants including mental institution inmates, convicted criminals, and even CIA operatives, resulting in several deaths by suicide. In addition to LSD, hundreds of other drugs were tested for possible use in mind control and other objectives. In the wake of the Watergate scandal in 1973, the secret program was scuttled and most of its records destroyed, but a 1974 New York Times expos√© brought the program to the attention of the public. A cache of surviving records was discovered which formed the basis for this 3 August 1977 joint hearing of the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on Human Resources. It remains a seminal document of one of the CIA's most disturbing chapters. No examples traced at auction.  "
