FOOTNOTE: " Washington stands upon a pedestal reading \"Sacred to Patriotism\" in front of the Bowling Green park in Manhattan, where a statue of King George was famously toppled in 1776. He is flanked by two monuments to liberty and independence dedicated to the soldiers and sailors of the Revolution; they bear a resemblance to the later Washington Monument in the capitol. The source image for this design was a 1798 engraving by Tiebout after Charles Buxton, which in turn used a Gilbert Stuart portrait. This rendition adds a long tribute to Washington above, noting that \"he was first in peace, first in the hearts of the Americans.\" The eagle bears a ribbon reading \"This plate is with due respect inscribed to the Congress of the United States,\" with 19 state banners hung below--the first 20 states minus Louisiana. Illinois, admitted as the 21st state in 1818, is also omitted. Collins, Threads of History 54; Hart 676n.  "
