FOOTNOTE: ' A complete run of the first Jewish periodical published in America. It
  was issued in response to a Christian missionary publication, "Israel''s Advocate;
  or, the Restoration of the Jews Contemplated and Urged"--and is subtitled "Against
  the Insidious Attacks of Israel''s Advocate." It grapples with the Advocate''s arguments
  issue by issue, drawing upon both the Old and New Testaments for its theological
  points, and also finds time to rebut other enemies. The "black Jews" of Malabar
  are discussed at length on pages 263-278. <BR><BR>The editor Solomon Henry Jackson
  (circa 1770-1847) emigrated from England in 1787 and lived in rural Pike County,
  Pennsylvania for many years before establishing himself as a printer in New York
  in the 1820s. He later translated and printed the first American Hebrew prayer book
  and issued the first American Haggadah (Goldman 34 and 125). <BR><BR>Lomazow 169
