FOOTNOTE: " First edition of this frequently reprinted revision. The prayers are printed in English and Hebrew on facing pages. The 48-page section of English-language \"Select Prayers\" includes prayers for children, wedding and burial services, and more. Goldman 59; Singerman 2337. <BR><BR>The contents are identical to lot 127 above, with the same 1872 copyright statement on verso of the title page. However, the paper is thinner (this copy is Â¾ inches thick, as opposed to 1 inch for the previous copy), and the printing is slightly less distinct. A few pages have bits of dropped text, such as the page numbers for 65 and 113. It may be an early stereotype reprint. The binding is also different although apparently by the same binder: red versus green, with slightly different and more elaborate gilt stamping including added floral patterns between the band on the backstrip, but with the same pattern at the backstrip ends. If you enjoy these kinds of bibliographical fine points, perhaps consider bidding on both copies. "
