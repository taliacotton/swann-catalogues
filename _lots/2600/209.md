TYPESET: "Engraved certificate printed on vellum, 13Â¾ x 10 inches, and completed in manuscript for William Rogers upon completing his third degree at Union Lodge in New London, CT, with signatures of 4 officers, and embossed seal attached by 10-inch ribbon; tacked to mat board, printing crisp and clear, manuscript portions a bit faded, minor wear to ribbon and seal."
FOOTNOTE: " This certificate is illustrated with an angel blowing a trumpet, two statues on pillars, a woman with three small children, and other ornaments. At bottom is the clearly visible imprint: \"Engraved Printed & Sold by Paul Revere Boston.\" Revere initially engraved this plate circa 1773, perhaps earlier. He seems to have offered copies at his shop, for sale to his fellow Masons. The original version was in regular use through at least 1779. In 1796, he made some changes to the original plate, most notably adding the line at top \"And the darkness comprehended it not; in the East a place of light.\" He then sold the plate to Elias Perkins, Junior Warden of the Masonic lodge in New London, CT. Brigham records only 3 other known examples of this state of the certificate, all issued to New Haven masons between 1799 and 1812. The original plate was given to the National Gallery in 1943. See Brigham, Paul Revere's Engravings, pages 188 and 195-197 (plate 65). We trace no other Revere-engraved certificates at auction since 1976. <BR>WITH--a hand-painted leather Masonic apron of similar vintage tacked to the same mat board, 13 x 15 inches; minor wear to silk fringe, the mat board itself being a bit chipped at bottom. <BR><BR>AND--another Masonic apron of embroidered silk, 14 x 14 inches, with initials BGW; wear to silk fringe and backing.
