FOOTNOTE: " The editor was Harmanus Neff, a captain in the 19th Pennsylvania Infantry; August Wilhelm and Frederick Schell of the same regiment engraved the regimental coat of arms for the masthead. This issue is dubbed \"Vol. 2, No. 1\" but a note explains that Volume 1 was issued when the regiment was in militia service in 1856. The editor apologizes for the \"Camp Field and Tent not affording the same facilities for elaborate execution and neatness of appearance as our well-regulated offices in the cities.\" Written very early in the war before Bull Run, topics include the recent Battle of Big Bethel, and the genius of General Winfield Scott. At least one other issue followed, on 4 July (not present).  "
