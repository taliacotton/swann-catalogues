FOOTNOTE: " The central figure brandishing his sword is Senator Nathaniel P. Tallmadge of New York, dressed in the costume of a character from a popular play, Major Joe Bunker. Tallmadge was a pro-bank soft money advocate, fighting a losing battle against his president, fellow Democrat Van Buren. As they march toward their distressed \"Madisonian\" colleagues, a much larger crowd gathers at the Van Buren Hotel under the president's portrait, eager to hear \"The Message\"--a 14 September 1837 message to Congress setting forth his plan for an independent treasury. This is the first state, with a reversed \"J\" in the title, which was corrected in the copyright deposit copy at the Library of Congress. None traced of either state at auction. Reilly 1837-13.  "
