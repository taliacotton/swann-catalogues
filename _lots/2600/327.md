FOOTNOTE: " First edition of a beautifully produced book of Mexican views. Created in the wake of the Mexican-American War, this is a travel book rather than a military history, though some of the views depict armies. Some of the plates draw upon Nebel and others for source images, but others were from original paintings by Phillips and Rider, whose signatures appear in the plates for Vera Cruz, Real del Monte, and Zimapán. The views cover much of the country, from the Caribbean coast, inland to Mexico City, and then to the Gulf Coast. All are lithographed by Day & Son. Phillips was an officer of the Real del Monte mining company, and contributed the text, offered in English and Spanish. Abbey Travel, II:671; Palau 224780; Sabin 62498. "
