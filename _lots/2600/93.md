FOOTNOTE: ' This view depicts Cumberland Gap at the junction of the Virginia, Kentucky,
  and Tennessee borders, a heavily traveled thoroughfare for western migration and
  a strategic objective during the war. The Union finally gained control in September
  1863. This view was drawn from the southeast on the Tennessee side, with the sprawling
  encampment of the 91st Indiana Infantry in the foreground, with its commissary,
  tents, and dress parade in progress; as well as the headquarters of General Kenner
  Garrard, a cavalry commander in the Army of the Cumberland, and the post''s hospital,
  commissary, and guard house. Commanding the heights in the background are batteries
  of artillery regiments from Ohio, Michigan, and Tennessee. Framed at center is the
  gap, with the American flag flying high, captioned "Long may she wave, we''ll keep
  her there or die." A small marker at the crossroads is captioned: "That blue stone
  in the Gap is the corner stone of Virginia, Ky and Tenn." The sun sinking to the
  left helps to establish the orientation. <BR><BR>The 91st Indiana was stationed
  at Cumberland Gap from January to May 1864. The artist was Francis Adolph Thuis
  (1837-1898), who was raised in the Netherlands and came to Vincennes, IN as a young
  man in 1857. He enlisted in Company A of the 91st Indiana Infantry but was detailed
  as a musician. After the war he was a harness-maker in Vincennes, and remained active
  in music with his church chorus. He made at least one other nearly identical version
  of this view, which is held by the Indiana Historical Society.  '
