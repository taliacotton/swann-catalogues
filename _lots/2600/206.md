FOOTNOTE: " This little accordion-style folding pamphlet raises alarms about the Bolsheviks who had gained control of Russia and were heading for America. Issued by the nationalist American Defense Society, it asserts that \"in parts of Russia today, women and children are State property. All over eighteen, married and unmarried must register at the bureau of free love subject to the will of any man who may order them to follow him.\" A membership blank is addressed to treasurer Robert Appleton. The illustrations are mostly cartoons by Erickson, with one borrowed from the Saturday Evening Post of 12 April 1919. None others traced in OCLC or elsewhere.  "
