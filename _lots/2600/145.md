FOOTNOTE: " The most famous man in this album is undoubtedly Joshua L. Chamberlain, a Bowdoin graduate who had served as a professor, reached the rank of Major General as Maine's leading Civil War hero, was Maine's governor from 1867 to 1871, and then returned to Bowdoin as its president. He is represented by his well-known Brady portrait, his signature \"J.L. Chamberlain\" on the facing page, and the following photograph which is captioned \"Residence of Gov. Chamberlain occupied formerly by Prof. Henry W. Longfellow, the poet.\" On the other end of the socioeconomic spectrum is a photograph of \"Pete Curtis, the college janitor, called by the students Diogenes, died April 1868,\" followed by his residence \"Diogenes' Hut\" containing \"one of the best private libraries in Brunswick.\" Classmate William Pitt Mudgett had served as a lieutenant with the 11th Maine Infantry during the war, although this is not noted in his inscription. The yearbook was owned by James Wallace McDonald of Stoneham, MA, and the longer inscriptions are addressed to him. <BR><BR>WITH--leaflets for the Class of 1867's 1901 and 1910 reunions laid in.  "
