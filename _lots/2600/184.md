FOOTNOTE: " The newspaper's publisher, John Dunlap, is famous for producing the first printing of the Declaration of Independence (not included here!) News of frontier tensions is often seen. On 22 July, reports from Pittsburgh inform that \"Col. Boon\" heard that General Scott had burned three Indian towns in Ohio; and that \"Cornplanter's Indians . . . have taken up the hatchet. . . . What the event will be, God only knows.\" A black-bordered obituary of patriot-printer William Bradford appears in the 28 September 1791 issue; President Washington's State of the Union address appears in the 26 October 1791 issue. The 28 November issue announces the first almanac by Black scientist Benjamin Banneker: \"An Almanac, for 1792, is published at Baltimore by Benjamin Banneker, a free Negro, born in Baltimore.\" The advertisements include notices of runaway slaves, theatrical performances, book releases and auctions, and even a very early prefabricated house on 2 December: \"A very strong, new Frame of a Building, which has not yet been put up . . . and all the materials prepared to enclose it\" by William Colliday.
