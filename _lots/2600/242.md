FOOTNOTE: " The sharp-tongued congressman John Randolph of Roanoke (1773-1833) was one of the most renowned orators of his era. Offered here is a letter written jointly with his friend and second cousin Isham Randolph (1771-1844). Isham writes to his son David: \" I rec'd yours of the 13th at Roanoke while in bed having . . . a high fever, but my friend J.R. gave some madisen which relieved me. . . . His servants were constantly attending my room both day & night. Indeed if I had been his son he could not have ren'd me more attention. . . . He has made me consent to stay with him till Saturday or Sunday as he says he has a great deal to say. . . . His health is much better than when I saw him last.\" <BR><BR>John Randolph then adds a two-page postscript in his own hand: \"Do me the favour to tell Mr. Charles Ellis that your father has been so kind as to undertake to select some of his articles (imported in the Equator) for me when he gets to Richmond. I have left Mr. Ellis's advertisement at home but I will enumerate a few that he will be so good as to keep for me.\" He then adds a long narrative list of mercantile goods, such as \"ready made great coats for myself & servants. . . . Gaiters, but 3 of the gaiters to be black for servants. . . Grass, bramble & grain scythes. . . . Two hall door brass locks, large size, one dozen ditto for dining, drawing room & bed chamber doors, as many for closets & dressing rooms. I wish them all to be without key holes in the plate of the lock, so that you can lock the door on the outside & bolt it within. I shall also want some acres of carpet--Brussells, Axminster (or Wilton) & Turkey.\" He adds a postscript: \"Tell my waggoners to keep clear of Cary Street.\" <BR><BR>Also included in the lot is a letter to Isham Randolph, discussing John Randolph of Roanoke two months later. Wyatt Cardwell (a close associate of the congressman) writes: \"Mr. Randolph has been confin'd at my house ever since the day of election for president, having come down on that day for the purpose of giving his vote. He appears to be entirely free from that high degree of excitement that attended him during last winter & much less than when you saw him last. On the contrary, he is perfectly calm and pleasant, though complains of much pain at times with his usual cough, and I fear weakens. He express'd the warmest thanks for your kind feelings. . . . A visit from you to see Mr. R would give me much pleasure while he is at my house.\" Charlotte Court House, VA (very near the Roanoke plantation), 29 November 1832<BR><BR>Also included are 5 identical armorial bookplates reading \"Nil admirari, vari quae sentiat, John Randolph of Roanoke,\" engraver unknown, 3¾ x 2½ inches.
