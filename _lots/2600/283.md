FOOTNOTE: ' Edwin Le Roy Patton (1803-1880) was born in South Carolina, lived briefly
  in Indiana as a young man, and settled in Robertson County in east-central Texas
  by 1839. There he became a prominent landholder and was named the county''s Chief
  Justice in 1843. Though well past the usual fighting age, he volunteered for the
  Confederacy in the Civil War. <BR><BR>At the heart of this lot is a humble diary
  kept by Patton from 5 March to 16 May 1839, with 3 additional entries written in
  1842. It extends over just 5 pages on a long narrow notebook (12Â¼ x 4 inches) with
  worn paper wrappers; the two main diary leaves are detached and worn at the edges
  with moderate loss of text. Most of the entries make brief note of the grueling
  labor of frontier agriculture: splitting rails, planting corn and potatoes. Patton
  was also on the muster rolls as a private in the Texas Rangers during this period,
  and this diary describes three occasions when he was summoned for "rainging" expeditions.
  On 16 March, he wrote "Received orders from Capt. [James D.] Mathews [to] range
  tomorrow week." This expedition was described briefly on 24 March: "Went rainging
  with Majr. Weppler, camped on small creek after visiting Grand Praire Creek, Parkers
  Creek." The next day he returned home. The next mission started on 9 April: "Went
  rainging with Capt. Mathews & 20 men, lay near Camp Creek." The next day, "crossed
  Duck Creek, came to the Grand Prairae, saw buffalo & antelope, camped on the watters
  of Little Brasses" [Brazos]. He returned home on the third day: "The company separated,
  6 of us, Capt. Reed, Hill, myself and 2 others came down Little B." Finally he noted
  on 29 April: "Went rainging, slep in Indian camp," and returned home the next day.
  <BR><BR>When not "rainging," Patton was busy ranching, farming, and participating
  in civic life. His longest and perhaps most dramatic entry was on 1 April: "Circuit
  court . . . Heard the trial of Mrs. Mompherd alias Mrs, White for bigamy, found
  guilty. News came in of Indians having stole horses at Timas and yesterday of driving
  of cattle from the settlement above Strouds. . . . Hardon found guilty of purgery,
  sentenced to fifty lashes & $500 fine." He discussed nearby Stroud''s Station a
  couple of other times: "Went Strouds with Judge Slaughter & Sqr. Owen, returned
  in the evening, driveing 9 cow for slaughter & beef" (30 March); "Indians at Strouds
  stole 2 horses" (7 April). Among the handful of later entries, 28 July 1842 stands
  out: "Indians stole horses Sunday night last." Early Texas diaries are rarely seen.
  We can trace no other manuscript civilian diaries from the Republic of Texas at
  auction since 2007. <BR><BR>The diary is accompanied by related papers of Edwin
  L. Patton and his family: 29 letters dated 1826 to 1862, and 28 accounts and legal
  documents dated 1835 to 1853. Brother William Patton of Sims Creek, AL, wrote on
  13 October with extensive commentary on the presidential election, including rumors
  that "the abolitionists will yet put up a candidate of their own as Clay refuses
  to harmonize with them." Another brother, George Ross Patton, wrote from Green County,
  AL on 20 May 1844 with a detailed list of the family''s recent slave purchases,
  adding: "We feel considerable anxiety on the subject of the anexation of Texas to
  the Union and hope the friends of the polacy will act firm and fearless regardless
  of our political opponants both of England and America on the subject of slavery."
  An old friend named McElwain from Pike County, Indiana discussed politics on 28
  June 1858: "Two years ago about Kansas, Duglas started the fus to win over the South
  for president but he can''t comit. . . . As to slavery, I''m willing to wait God
  time, as I think all things will move agreable to his order." As war approached,
  son W.W. Patton wrote from Cotton Gin, TX on 2 December 1860: "We have had a great
  deel of political excitement . . . we have organized a company at Cotton Gin and
  are trying to organize another. Cotton Gin is a fast place." A few items relate
  to Edwin Patton''s nephew Thomas Monroe Patton (1822-1888), also of Robertson County,
  including a Texas state land grant issued to and signed by Governor George T. Wood,
  quite worn, Austin, TX, 3 October 1849; and a letter from cousin Thomas L.C. Means
  of Sims Creek, SC ("there has been a great deal of sickness about Clinton and some
  deaths but principally among the Negroes"), 28 February 1846. <BR><BR>Son Thomas
  McCutcheon Patton wrote 3 times while on duty in the Confederate Army, twice from
  Camp Wright on Red River County, TX in August 1862, and once from Camp Camden in
  Arkansas, 13 September 1862. On 13 August he wrote "We heard an Indian preach. He
  preached in ower tung. He said it was his first time. I do not like the looks of
  the Indians." On 13 September he wrote that "L.W. Kidwell shot himself through the
  hand," complained that "Arkansis is verry poor country," and noted that his horse
  "came very near dying" on the march. Private Patton died two months later on 22
  November. <BR><BR>WITH--a small group of family papers of William Gaston Parsons
