FOOTNOTE: " The author Samuel Longstreth Parrish (1849-1932) was a founder of two of the great institutions of the Hamptons: Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in Southampton (the oldest incorporated golf club in America) and the Parrish Art Museum. Here he recounts his instrumental role in bringing golf to America in 1891, after learning of the game during a trip to Europe. He brought over a professional with a supply of clubs and balls, chose the spot for the course in a grassy stretch among the dunes, and even drove \"the first golf ball ever struck on the Shinnecock Hills.\" The legendary course has since hosted 5 U.S. Opens spread out over three different centuries. <BR><BR>\"A valuable addition to the shelf in that it records some first-hand impressions of the start and growth of golf in America\"--Murdoch, Bibliography of Golf 591.
