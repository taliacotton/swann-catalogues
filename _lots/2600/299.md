FOOTNOTE: " These plates come from Justo Germán Cantero's book \"Los Ingenios: Colección de Vistas de los Principales Ingenios de Azúcar de la Isla de Cuba,\" a work by a Cuban sugar plantation owner which is most often remembered for these gold-bordered plates by Eduardo LaPlante. Included here are 4 views of laborers (very likely enslaved) at work in field and factory: \"Casa de Calderas del Ing'o S'n Martin\"; \"Ingenio Flor de Cuba\"; \"Ingenio de Amistad\"; and \"Ingenio Intrepido.\" We trace no complete copies of Cantero's work with text at auction since 1995 (which brought £10,350).
