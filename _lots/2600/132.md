FOOTNOTE: " The third edition of Rhode Island's Acts and Laws, preceded only by 1719 Boston and 1730 Newport printings; the Charter is almost always found appended at the beginning as seen here. The printer Ann Smith Franklin (1696-1763) was the sister-in-law of Benjamin Franklin, and served as the official printer to the colony for the last 27 years of her life. She ran into a bit of trouble for printing up a few additional copies of this edition for private sale, which was expressly forbidden by the General Assembly in June 1745, with a £5 penalty for each copy sold. She has nonetheless since been inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame. Alden, Rhode Island 68, 72; Church 952 and 952a; Evans 5483, 5683; Sabin 70512; Tower 811.  "
