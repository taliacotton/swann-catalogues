FOOTNOTE: " The rising Yale sophomores had a longstanding traditional ceremony, the \"Burying of Euclid,\" which featured the destruction of their freshman textbooks. The student chosen by his classmates to lead the ceremony in 1848, Asa French, was singled out by the administration for suspension, which both surprised and angered his classmates. They drafted and signed this statement, insisting that \"the custom of burying Euclid is time-honored\" and \"should be regarded as a class matter, each acting the part assigned to him by his class, assuming of course no individual responsibility.\" The statement was intended to serve as a sort of letter of reference, insisting that the suspension should not be regarded as a blight on French's character. <BR><BR>Asa French (1829-1903) of Braintree, MA was reinstated, graduated with the Class of 1851, and went on to a long law career; he was active in alumni affairs. Among the noteworthy students who signed here in his defense are journalist Richard Henry Sylvester (1830-1895); John William Hendrie (1830-1900), benefactor of the Law School's Hendrie Hall; Henry H. Jessup (1832-1910), missionary to Syria; and Colonel William Woolsey Winthrop (1831-1899), an expert on military law.  "
