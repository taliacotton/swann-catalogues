FOOTNOTE: " Blackmore was an English land promoter and speculator who was active in the American west. He took a deep interest in the Plains Indians and founded a museum of Indian artifacts in England. This essay was published as the introduction to Richard I. Dodge's book \"Hunting Grounds of the Great West\" in 1877, but is here published separately \"for private circulation only.\" It draws heavily on his personal experiences, and also devotes several pages to the recent Battle of the Little Bighorn. He emphasizes the savage cruelty of the American Indian and predicts that \"in a few years the only reminiscence of the Red Men will be the preservation of the names of some of the extinct tribes and dead chiefs in the nomenclature of the leading cities, counties, and States of the Great West.\"<BR><BR>Ironically, Blackmore became heavily indebted and killed himself in a fit of drunken despair the following year, while the American Indians are still here. We find 10 in OCLC and trace one at auction since 1923.  "
