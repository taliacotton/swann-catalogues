FOOTNOTE: " Second edition. Written by a noted Ecuadorian patriot while in exile in Philadelphia, this work explicitly links the American Revolution with the struggles for independence in Latin America. The title translates to \"Necessary Ideas for any Independent American People, who Wants to be Free.\" It begins with a substantial essay by Rocafuerte, but the bulk of the book is devoted to Spanish translations of the Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation and Constitution, an address by John Adams, and perhaps the first translation of Thomas Paine's Common Sense into Spanish (\"Sentido Comun\"). An early American Spanish-language imprint. The imprint line of this edition reads \"Puebla 1823, Impresas en Filadelfia, y por su original en la oficina de D. Pedro de la Rosa, Impresor del Gobierno.\" Sabin 72275; Shaw & Shoemaker 13974.  "
