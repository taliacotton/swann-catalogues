DESCRIPT: "(RHODE ISLAND.)"
CROSSHEAD: Large collection of billheads from Rhode Island and beyond.
at-a-glance: Various places, 1752-1975, bulk 1850-1910
TYPESET: Approximately 1300 items, neatly sleeved in 9 binders (2.3 linear feet);
  condition generally strong.
FOOTNOTE: ' A substantial and absorbing collection of ephemera. Just about any kind
  of mid or large-sized business involved in invoicing customers might have its own
  printed billheads. Represented here are everything from cracker bakers to silversmiths
  to toy stores to hotels. Many are illustrated, ranging from generic woodcuts to
  expertly rendered views of storefronts and factory complexes. Interspersed with
  the billheads are a few examples of illustrated letterheads used for correspondence.
  The great bulk of the billheads have been used for invoicing a wide variety of customers,
  allowing us to get a taste of the products offered. Many are marked as paid, either
  in manuscript or with an inked stamp, and many were docketed on verso. Several billheads
  from printers and stationers are included; if you want to get "meta," there is even
  an 1898 billhead from Worcester, MA for printing letterheads. <BR><BR>Billheads
  from Providence, RI comprise approximately half of the collection, arranged alphabetically
  by business name. 2 binders with approximately 250 billheads cover the remainder
  of Rhode Island, arranged by town. 3 binders with approximately 400 items extend
  beyond Rhode Island. Arranged by state, the bulk are from Massachusetts, Connecticut
  and New York. A bill from the Danvers Lunatic Asylum in Massachusetts bills an inmate''s
  guardians for 24 days'' board plus mortuary expenses in 1891. <BR><BR>The glory
  days of commercial billheads were from about 1850 to 1910, but a handful of examples
  are included outside those bounds, with the earliest being a manuscript bill for
  pickle pots and jugs issued by a Newport merchant in 1752, and the earliest printed
  example being a 1794 invoice from Philadelphia haberdasher William Holdernesse.
  The latest is an illustrated 1975 letterhead from fine pen maker A.T. Cross Company.
  The bulk seem to be from the Yankee establishment which made up New England''s middle
  and upper classes, but a few represent the immigrants who came in the late 19th
  century, such as 7 different examples from the wholesale grocers of the Ventrone
  family who catered to Providence''s Italian community, 1897-1916; and funeral director
  Arsene Therien, "entrepreneur de pompes fun√®bres" in French-Canadian Woonsocket.
  <BR><BR>Much of this collection was exhibited at the University of Rhode Island
  in November 2001. Included with the lot is the exhibition catalog by Russell J.
  DeSimone, "A Survey of 19th Century Rhode Island Billheads" (#50 of 250). Provenance:
