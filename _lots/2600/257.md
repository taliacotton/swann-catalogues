FOOTNOTE: " This well-known image was taken as part of the grand western tour of young Grand Duke Alexis of Russia, who arranged to have Buffalo Bill Cody lead him on a buffalo hunt on the Great Plains, accompanied by Generals Custer and Sheridan, as well as Chief Spotted Tail. The party stopped in St. Louis on their return from the hunt, where Scholten photographed Custer and the Duke in their hunting garb for posterity. Custer is wearing his trademark red scarf--at least that is what we can assume from this black and white image. Katz, Custer in Photographs K-113.  "
