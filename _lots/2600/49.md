FOOTNOTE: ' Abraham Simon Wolf Rosenbach (1876-1952) was the leading dealer of antiquarian
  books in early 20th century America. In addition to his vast holdings and expertise
  in early Americana and American Judaica, he also became the leader in a more humble
  field: early 19th-century children''s chapbooks, based on a stock of remainders
  from his uncle Moses Pollok. His 1933 bibliography remains the state of the art
  for these ephemeral works. This lot demonstrates his marketing: a limited-edition
