FOOTNOTE: " Amelia Russell Whitman Fish (1840-1905) was raised in Massachusetts and was living in Louisville, KY when she met Civil War veteran Lawrence Brainard Fish (1841-1898). They were married in September 1869. Fish was assigned to a massive project to document Union gravesites throughout the South, so they could eventually be disinterred and consolidated into national cemeteries (see Swann's 17 September 2015 auction, lot 87, for a related notebook kept by Fish). Amelia resided in Louisville, KY and in Stone Mountain, GA while Fish traveled widely; her letters are addressed to him in Corinth, MS (where he was stationed for a longer period), various locations in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Georgia, and occasionally further afield. The letters cover the period of their courtship and first year of their marriage. <BR><BR>This collection is also of potential philatelic interest. Most of the letters are in their original envelopes with 3-cent Washington stamps, some grilled.  "
