FOOTNOTE: " This attractive broadside for a Manhattan beer distributor offers \"hogsheads, barrels and half barrels, for shipping, bottling & city use.\" If you like beer, and like to keep things simple, that's probably all you need to know. <BR><BR>An ad in the 1853 New York directory shows James D. Traphagen at this 117 Warren Street address as one of two wholesalers for the Albany brewery of Eggleston & Mix. The New York Times of 9 December 1854 reported a fire at this address, where the lower two stories were occupied by \"Mr. T. Traphagan, agent for Eccleston & Mise, manufacturers of Albany ale.\" Sadly, \"a considerable amount of ale was lost.\" In the 1857 and 1859 New York directories, James D. Traphagen was reported as a dealer in ale and porter at another address. He was apparently the James Dickerson Traphagen (1825-1863) from Ulster County who lived with his parents in Manhattan through the 1850s. <BR><BR>The frame bears a worn but nearly complete label from G.B. Owen & Co., \"Manufacturers and Dealers in Clocks, Looking-Glasses, Portrait and Picture Frames.\" George B. Owen was at the 325 Hudson Street address in Manhattan only from about 1854 to 1859, so this broadside was framed circa 1854.  "
