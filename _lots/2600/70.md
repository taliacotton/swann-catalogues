FOOTNOTE: " George Washington Collamore (1818-1863) was a Boston lawyer and abolitionist who went west to Kansas in 1856, helping to furnish food and supplies to Free-State settlers. At the outbreak of the war he served as brigadier general in the Kansas militia, and then was elected mayor of Lawrence in 1863. Lawrence had long been the base for Unionist raids on Confederate areas of nearby Missouri. On 21 August 1863, William Quantrill and his Quantrill Raiders descended on the town in revenge, killing 150 unarmed men and boys in what is known as the Lawrence Massacre. Among the fatalities was Mayor Collamore, who dove into a well when his home was surrounded; his body was pulled out after the raid.  "
