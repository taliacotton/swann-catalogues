This large watercolor typifies her postwar approach to landscape. Cabris is a picturesque village in the Alpes-Maritimes department of southeastern France, and was the hometown of her close friend Céline Tabary. Jones first visited the town in 1937 during her first year of studies in Paris, and returned numerous times over a period of some 50 years.
