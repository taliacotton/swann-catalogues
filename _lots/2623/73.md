  Seth Feman and Jonathan Frederick Walz, Alma W. Thomas: Everything is Beautiful,
  2021, p. 202.<br><br>Reflections is a beautiful and important early abstraction
  by Alma Thomas, painted at the cusp of her brilliant painting career. In 1960, Thomas
  had just resigned from her position at Shaw Junior High School, ending a thirty
  five year art teaching career, beginning a full-time dedication to painting at the
  age of 69. Thomas had been painting for decades prior - developing a body of work
  from modernist portraits and still lifes towards abstraction in the late 1950s.
  This painting shows Thomas''s embrace of abstraction by 1963, and the rich inspiration
  she found in nature - interests that would continue over the next nineteen years.
  Reflections''s inclusion in both her first and most recent retrospectives, the 1966
  Howard University exhibition and the 2021-22 traveling exhibition at Alma W. Thomas:
  Everything is Beautiful, organized by curators Seth Feman and Jonathan Frederick
  Walz, signifies this work''s significance and how it defines this important formative
  period of Thomas''s practice.<br><br>Reflections''s modernist composition is an
  excellent representative of Thomas''s abstract painting from the early 1960s. Her
  abstractions from nature at this moment are characterized by saturated blue or red
  colors and punctuated by rapid brushstrokes and "scraffito" or palette knife markings.
  This elegant composition is centered on a representation of color and light reflected
  in a river or pond, but is also punctuated with passages of early fall colors and
  suggestions of branches at the edges. Thomas had an affinity with the deep hue of
  ultramarine blue. Several paintings of the period, from The Stormy Sea, 1958, collection
  of the Smithsonian American Art Museum to Blue Abstraction, 1961, Howard University
  Gallery of Art are centered on this expressive color.<br><br>Reflections is also
  an important precursor to Thomas''s later body of work centered on reflections found
  in nature. In 1964, this period of painting was interrupted by a severe attack of
  arthritis--an interval that led to her "mature" style and first retrospective at
  Howard University in 1966. Alma Thomas achieved unparalleled critical success and
  national public recognition in 1972 with her solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum
  of American Art, a first for an African American woman. Her interest in natural
  reflections of color continues in such later works as Late Night Reflections, 1972,
  the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, Pond - Spring Awakening, 1972, the
  Akron Art Museum and Snow Reflections on Pond, 1973, Smithsonian American Art Museum.<br><br>.</p>'
