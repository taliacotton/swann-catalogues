  is a beautiful and important early abstraction by Alma Thomas, painted at the cusp
  of her brilliant painting career. In 1960, Thomas had just resigned from her position
  at Shaw Junior High School, ending a thirty five year art teaching career, beginning
  a full-time dedication to painting at the age of 69. Thomas had been painting for
  decades prior - developing a body of work from modernist portraits and still lifes
  towards abstraction in the late 1950s. This painting shows Thomas''s embrace of
  abstraction by 1960, and the rich inspiration she found in nature - interests that
  would continue over the next nineteen years. <em>Reflections</em>'' inclusion in
  both her first and most recent retrospectives, the 1966 Howard University exhibition
  and the 2021-22 traveling exhibition at <em>Alma W. Thomas: Everything is Beautiful</em>,
  organized by curators Seth Feman and Jonathan Frederick Walz, signifies this work''s
  significance and how it defines this important formative period of Thomas''s practice

  modernist composition is an excellent representative of Thomas''s abstract painting
  from the early 1960s. Her abstractions from nature at this moment are characterized
  by saturated blue or red colors and punctuated by rapid brushstrokes and <em>sgraffito</em>
  or palette knife markings. This elegant composition is centered on a representation
  of color and light reflected in a river or pond, but is also punctuated with passages
  of early fall colors and suggestions of branches at the edges. Thomas had an affinity
  with the deep hue of ultramarine blue. Several paintings of the period, from <em>The
  Stormy Sea</em>, 1958, collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum to<em>
  Blue Abstraction</em>, 1961, Howard University Gallery of Art are centered on this
  expressive color.<br><br><em>Reflections</em> is also an important precursor to
  Thomas''s later body of work centered on reflections found in nature. In 1964, this
  period of painting was interrupted by a severe attack of arthritis--an interval
  that led to her "mature" style and first retrospective at Howard University in 1966.
  Alma Thomas achieved unparalleled critical success and national public recognition
  in 1972 with her solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, a first
  for an African American woman. Her interest in natural reflections of color continues
  in such later works as <em>Late Night Reflections</em>, 1972, the Nasher Museum
  of Art at Duke University, <em>Pond - Spring Awakening</em>, 1972, the Akron Art
  Museum and <em>Snow Reflections on Pond</em>, 1973, Smithsonian American Art Museum.</p>'
