CROSSHEAD: "Schnackenberg: Kostüme / Plakate und Dekorationen."
year: "1924"
at-a-glance: "Munich: Musarion, 1922"
TYPESET: "Second Edition. Introductory text by Oskar Bie. Small folio, 13¼ x 10¼ inches. 43 plates, most are beautifully colored in pochoir. Publisher's cloth-backed pictorial boards, slightly bowed, extremities scuffed, tips bumped with some residual soft creasing to plate gutters; usual mild offsetting throughout. An excellent compendium of Schnackenberg's posters, costumes and stage designs. The plates in this book are more in keeping with the Maitres de l'Affiche images, in that they were pulled by Oskar Consee (Schnackenberg's exclusive printer), and were surely done under the artist's supervision, with rich inking on high-quality paper."
