FOOTNOTE: "The design of the poster, which echoes the book jacket design of Sutnar's 1961 publication of the same name, is attributed to Noel Martin, who used Sutnar's images and typography to promote Sutnar's book and exhibition of the same name. By 1960, Sutnar had stopped working for Sweet's catalogues, and this exhibition was an attempt by some of his colleagues to get his name, tenets of functional design and his talent for information graphics out before the public in order to attract commissions. The exhibition was \"a systematic summarization of the principles of visual communication and the personal manifesto of a designer who spent forty years developing it\" (Sutnar p. 260). Sutnar 488 (var)."
DESCRIPT: "MARTIN, NOEL."
