FOOTNOTE: "\"The great \"Map of the Pacific States\", originated in 1863 by William
  H. Knight, proliferated in 1864 into a whole family of notable maps, automatically
  establishing the rising H.H. Bancroft house as the greatest map publisher of the
  Pacific Coast. So large in size are these maps and so overflowing with detail, it
  is utterly impossible to describe their minutiae\" (Wheat). \n\nIndeed, the geographical
  information is rich, showing Indian regions, established territorial counties and
  towns, military forts, mountain peaks, prairies, valleys, lakes and river systems,
  stage roads such as \"Mullan's Wagon Road from Walla Walla to Fort Benton\", \"Emigrant
  Route to Oregon\", the \"Proposed Northern Pacific Railroad\" line, and a gold region
  at the Canadian border of the Rockies. Western Montana, on the cusp of becoming
  its own territory, is still part of Idaho. \n\nScant institutional copies; last
  auction appearance at Streeter (#3916). Wheat, Transmississippi, 1092. "
