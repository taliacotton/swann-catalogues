FOOTNOTE: "\n\"DAKOTA the Land of Promise! Could the uninformed or incredulous see
  it, they would realize that the promised increase of immigrations had come, and
  with a force having no precedent in the history of our country; nor would they wonder
  at the great activity and prosperity of Dakota and her people, of which and whom
  they know and hear so little... Like all new countries, Dakota has a good, a better
  and its best portion, which may be geographically assigned to its Northern, Central
  and Southern Divisions, but that section famously known as \"The Jim River Valley\",
  is not only an unsurpassed wheat growing land, but, beyond doubt, is the best on
  the globe for general farming, and now is the time to go there.\" OCLC locates one
  example, Yale. "
