TYPESET: "Hand-colored double-page engraved map of the European continent and northern Africa with a decorative strapwork inset framing 20 figures in various regional dress. 15¼x20¾ inches sheet size, wide margins, Latin text on verso; centerfold flattened and reinforced, a few minor edge tears expertly repaired."
at-a-glance: "Antwerp, 1593"
FOOTNOTE: "Attractive example of de Jode's scarce map of Europe, notable for the massive \"Terra Nova Zemla\" sweeping across the Arctic with waterways and channels leading to an open north sea. Similarly of interest to the enthusiast of sixteenth-century cartographic curiosities will be the inclusion of three phantom islands in the north Atlantic seen here: Frisland, St. Brendan's Island, and Hy-Brasil. It should also be noted that the printed date in the title block is inaccurately engraved and reads MDCXIII, whereas it should properly say MDXCIII. "
