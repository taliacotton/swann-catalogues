After the war he continued his education at the University of Cambridge and when World War II came, he again served with the Royal Navy, ultimately elevating to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. After spending several years in Africa, Furse and his wife Barbara settled down in the village of Hampton, New Brunswick, Canada. There he spent his retirement years creating and publishing well-studied whimsical pictorial cartography in the mid-1960s. \n\nHere Furse has rendered an incredibly detailed manuscript map that richly describes the regional history of southern Ontario from the age of discovery to the mid-twentieth century.
