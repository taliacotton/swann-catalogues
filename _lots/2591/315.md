FOOTNOTE: "\"Taste is a branch of judgement, as imagination is of genius. As it is the province of imagination, by new combinations of sensible objects, to form new images, so it is that of taste, to select, or reject the combinations of imagination, according to the standard of beauty or deformity. In a word, taste is judgement exercised on the works of imagination. Taste is judgement applied to the discrimination of beauty from deformity. The question will then arise, What is beauty?\""
