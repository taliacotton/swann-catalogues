FOOTNOTE: '"This stunning aquatint was conceived through the combined efforts of two
  of the most talented participants in nineteenth-century American printmaking circles:
  the young John William Hill (he was twenty-four years old at the time) and the master
  aquatint engraver William James Bennett. While maintaining undisputed harmony in
  the wide pictorial world he has constructed, Hill presents five different topographic
  spheres: a scene in Brooklyn, nautical activity on the East River, the dense settlement
  of Manhattan, the Hudson River, and the far-off shores of New Jersey. This he has
  done innovatively, without reference to the conventional devices of a foreground
  landscape, coulisse trees, or other border elements traditionally used in achieving
  a compact, pleasing design. ...The copperplate that resulted from the collaboration
  of Hill and Bennett is still in existence. It was found at the turn of the twentieth
  century in the old establishment of Currier and Ives, where it had long served as
  a floor plate under a stove. As the sky was badly damaged, it was burnished out
  of the plate" -- Deak, Picturing America, 463. '
