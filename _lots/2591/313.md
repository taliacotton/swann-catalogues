FOOTNOTE: 'A beautifully illustrated album of Japanese World War II propaganda images.
  The scenes endorsing the bravery of the Japanese navy are extremely dramatic: the
  attack on Pearl Harbor, various Indonesian engagements, the Japanese attack on Clark
  Air Field, the Japanese occupation of Singapore, a Japanese submarine attacking
  the U.S.S. Lexington, Japanese Zeroes on the offensive, and a scene of captured
  Americans on Wake Island are only a few. Perhaps the most revealing is a chilling
  fantasy illustration appearing at the end picturing Japanese navy bombers in formation
  over New York City by Kokan Kojo.'
