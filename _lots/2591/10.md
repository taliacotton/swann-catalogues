at-a-glance: "Rome, 1799"
FOOTNOTE: "Rare Italian imprint of this excellent chart first prepared by the Depot de la Marine in 1778 for use by the French navy during the Revolutionary War. Completely re-engraved by Giovanni Brun in Rome, the Italian eliminates recognition to both Sartine and the Depot de la Marine, however the nomenclature remains entirely in French. The geography follows the original extremely closely, showing great detail of the coast from Philadelphia to northern Florida, as well as excellent inland information west to the Appalachian Mountains."
