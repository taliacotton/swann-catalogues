FOOTNOTE: "The title here is misleading since there does exist Mifflinburg, Pennsylvania, approximately fifty miles to its west; however, the beginnings of the town of Mifflinville are represented by this original hand-drawn plat. \n\nA tiny community on the banks of the Susquehanna River in Columbia County, Mifflinville's layout hasn't changed a great deal in the intervening 225 years since this document was drafted: the sparse north/south streets remain John, Mary, Ann, Market, Race, and Fair; the east/west streets shown here only to Fifth have expanded a whole two blocks up to Seventh. At the center of the map between Ann and Race streets we find \"Burying Grounds\" and indeed the town's cemetery is still located in that spot, with a modicum of homes and scarce businesses built up around it. \n\nLettered references are keyed with an explanatory panel at the upper left: \"A. A Market place, and in the Center of it a public building. B for an English College. C for a German College. D is the ground or places marked and laid out for the different denominations of Christian Societies. The vacant ground, in Front of the Town, is to be left open for use of the whole Town, except the use of the Ferry, and the Fishing is Kept for the Proprietors & is marked in the Plan F/M or for a Fish market\". \n\nThis is followed by an outline of Conditions for the town's establishment: \"There are 10 places laid out for the use of Churches & meeting houses of the different denominations of Societies & the first 12 Settlers of any Society shall have the first choice of one of said 10 places, for that purpose, & the next 12 Settlers of any Society shall have the same choice as before & so on until the 10 places are applied for the purpose aforesaid. The out Lots belonging to the East Liberty lay about a mile from Mifflinsburg. April 8th 1796\". \n\nThe industry and commerce which the proprietors surely imagined for the future of their town never much materialized and at no point has her population grown far beyond 2,000 residents; but from a historical standpoint it is delightful to compare this birth-certificate document to the Mifflinville of today and observe how closely it still resembles Rittenhouse and Kunkle's original 18th-century plan. \n\nFor an extensive history of the town (with mention of the present document) see J.H. Beers, Historical and Biographical Annals of Columbia and Montour Counties, Pennsylvania, 1915, pages 249-252. "
