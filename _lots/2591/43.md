CROSSHEAD: "[Lunar map broadside]."
TYPESET: Aquatint and engraved map of the moon's surface on a sheet with two columns
  of letterpress describing Cassini's rare 1679 lunar chart and several newer discoveries
  by late-eighteenth century astronomers. 17Â½x23 inches sheet size, wide margins with
  deckle edges; old folds, foxing.
at-a-glance: "[Rome?, circa 1787]"
FOOTNOTE: "Cassini's large-scale map of the moon printed in 1679 was an influential
  scientific phenomenon. Even at the time of its publication copies were scarce and
  the copper printing plate was presumed lost for over 100 years. In 1787 Cassini's
  heirs discovered the plate in the archives of the Imprimerie Royale and a new edition
  was struck; and along with it, a certain renewed interest to the greater public
  and scientific community.\n\nThe present Italian broadside is a piggyback on that
  re-kindled awareness of lunar cartography; Giovanni Brun reproduces the layout of
  the original with general faithfulness but gives us a greatly reduced model with
  topographical nomenclature added. One playful detail that is repeated from the original
  is a subtly hidden head of a woman peering out from the Promontorium Heraclides
  at lower right, a feature quasi-famously known as Cassini's \"Moon Maiden\". \n"
