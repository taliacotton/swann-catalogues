TYPESET: "<p>The French culinary scene depicts the interior of a lively kitchen. Oil
  on canvas over original wooden stretchers. 1270x1829mm; 50x72 inches. <br><br>Jean
  Pages was a prolific illustrator and muralist who decorated the interiors of many
  of the city's leading restaurants and private residences. In addition to its excellent
  French cuisine, La Caravelle was equally renowned for its famous clientele, which
  included the Kennedys, Walter Cronkite, Marlene Dietrich, John Lindsay, and the
  Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Pagès was hired to create a series of murals depicting
  typical Parisian scenes when the establishment served as a speakeasy during the
  Prohibition era. One of the murals was famously damaged by Salvador Dalí when the
  great surrealist's cane scratched its surface while dining there with friends. Neither
  this nor the other mural in the auction are the affected canvas.<br><br>Pages was
  born in Versailles and worked in France before being called to the U.S. in 1927
  by the publishing giant Condé Nast, for whom he contributed illustrations to Vogue
  until the outbreak of World War II. <br><br>Among the restaurants and supper clubs
  Mr. Pages decorated in addition to La Caravelle were The Maisonette at the St. Regis
  Hotel, the Rendezvous at the Plaza Hotel, Le Pavillon, Le Manoir, Clos Normand,
  Le Mistral, La Comedic, La Rotisserie and Le Cygne. For the interior decor at the
  famed Côte Basque, he collaborated with noted designer, Bernard LaMotte.</p>"
