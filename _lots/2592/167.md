TYPESET: "Two unidentified illustrations, most likely for an advertising campaign, circa 1930s or 1940s. Watercolor, ink, and gouache on board. 203x115 mm; 8x4Â½ inches each. Unsigned. Framed.<br><br>This charming pair juxtaposes a woman's unbridled joy at a work of abstract art in the manner of Jean (Hans) Arp with a disinterested man in his smoking gown, standing before his (quintessentially Addams-esque) mounted bear head. These may have been two boards from a larger series of illustrations as evidenced by the lack of Addams' signature, which he reserved for the final image of a series."
