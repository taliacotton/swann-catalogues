  <br><br>On the Town is one of the most beloved musicals of all time. The 1944 show
  about three sailors who try to cram a lifetime of New York experience into a single
  24-hour leave, debuted Leonard Bernstein's famous score to lyrics and script by
  Betty Comden &amp; Adolph Green. This production was its first major New York revival
  since 1971. <br><br>In Lobel's own words, <em>On the Town</em> was "the biggest
  and most ambitious production ever attempted at the Delacorte Theatre in the park.
  There is nothing there - and in order to do a sprawling musical with many locations,
  I had to come up with a giant machine that could hold a band, have a dance floor,
  and bring on all the scenery - at the same time not losing the sense of the spectacular
  locale of the park. It was only after sketching to the jazzy music for several weeks
  that I realized what I was drawing - a gigantic bridge with a 1940s band sitting
  on top - a bridge that could become Times square, The Museum of Natural History,
  Coney Island and many other places." The show was a great success in its original
  Central Park setting but failed to repeat that magic when it moved to Broadway.<br><br>Lobel
  has designed sets for Broadway, off-Broadway, and metropolitan and regional theater
  productions worldwide, including the Metropolitan Opera, Le Chatelet, The Royal
  National Theater, BAM, the Yale Repertory Theatre, Th√©atre Royal de la Monnai, New
  York City Opera, SUNY Purchase, and Central Park's Delacorte Theater. Her prolific
  work for the Mark Morris Dance Group is widely acclaimed. Many of her stage maquettes
  and designs are housed in the permanent collection of the McNay Art Museum, San
  Antonio, Texas, including those for the Houston Grand Opera productions of "Nixon
  in China" and "Street Scene." In 2002 she produced and was nominated for the Tony
  Award for Best Musical for "A Year With Frog and Toad" based upon the famous children's
  books by her late father, Arnold Lobel, whom she credits for instilling much of
  her work ethic and love of art.</p>
