TYPESET: "Original poster maquette for the 1954 film of the same title. Artwork attributed to Henri Cerutti or, alternately, to Rolf Goetze. Mixed media, including ink, wash, and charcoal heightened in white on board. 930x480 mm; 36½x19 inches, on 43½x29½-inch board. Unsigned; not dated. <br><br>While the maquette prominently features the film's star Ava Gardner, the face of her co-star Humphrey Bogart is conspicuously absent. A large line drawing of Bogart's face was later added to the final poster design just before printing, as the omission would have been a breach of the actor's contract."
