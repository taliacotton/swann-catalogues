DESCRIPT: EDWARD GOREY (1925-2000)
CROSSHEAD: 'Signals, Drawing #6.'
year: 1995
TYPESET: <p>A proposed but unfinished work intended for the set of limited-edition
  prints published by Signals Limited, 1995. Ink, watercolor, graphite, and wash,
  with three small collaged pieces, on Strathmore paper. 265x215 mm; 10½x8½ inches,
  on 14½x11½-inch sheet. Initialed "EG" in lower right corner. Taped to the lower
  right margin is a 1½x2¼-inch swatch of paper containing a penciled grid. Within
  it, Gorey worked out a cross design for one of the intricate wallpaper backgrounds
  in the drawing.<br><br><em>Signals </em>began as a catalogue that featured items
  related to PBS shows and carried a large amount of Gorey-related material over the
  years. Beginning in 1992, Gorey produced a series of ten limited edition offset
  lithographs exclusively for the catalog. Each of the ten prints in the series featured
  highly detailed scenes filled with imaginative Gorey characters and locations. For
  this piece, Gorey shows the interior and exterior of a three-story home using a
  cloud-like cutaway technique that is both intriguing and somewhat confusing. The
  exterior portions of the house are defined with a watercolor wash that enhances
  and slightly blurs the pen and ink details. In several areas, the watercolor became
  overworked leading to necessary corrections. These corrected areas, in conjunction
  with several unfinished details, indicate that Gorey abandoned this piece as it
  was nearing completion. The swatch with the wallpaper pattern draft taped to the
  bottom margin further evinces Gorey's painstaking attempts at graphic patterning<br>These
  qualities make this a desirable work for the true Gorey fan as such process pieces
  are uncommon on the market.<br>Special thanks to Irwin Terry for his insights and
  assistance with this lot.</p>
