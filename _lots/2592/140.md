  images of beaming, rosy-cheeked babies and young children that appeared on countless
  magazines, calendars, advertisements, and within her own two published juvenile
  works during the first half of the 20th century. She attended The Art Students League,
  the Cooper Union, and was an active member of the Society of Illustrators. Becker
  is credited for introducing the milk bottle into imagery of babies, an aesthetic
  decision which led to them being called "dairy pictures" by the advertising industry
  who used them to promote the association between consumption of dairy products with
  happy, plump, healthy children.</p>'
