Circa 1960s -80s.

Various sizes, the average measures 255x346 mm; 10x13¾. The black plastic sketchbook bears Eula's notes and loose sketches inside the covers (the rear with a cute pair captioned \"It's either this or this\").<br><br>A fabulous collection of Eula's own designs, sectioned off by him for his own reference purposes. We have left them intact as he organized them.<br><br>Eula's long and prolific career in fashion and performing arts began in the 1950s where, after serving in the Italian Campaign in World War II and completing studies at The Art Students League on the GI Bill, he was launched into the fashion world as the head illustrator for The New York Herald Tribune under Eugenia Sheppard. Soon to follow were positions at The London Sunday Times, American Vogue, The New York Times, and Italian Harper's Bazaar where he famously covered Yves Saint Laurent's first and last collections (1958 and 2002). However, it is as Halston's Creative Director throughout the 1970s that he is best remembered. That time was recently chronicled in the popular Netflix series \"Halston\" in which Eula is skillfully portrayed by actor David Pittu."
