TYPESET: "Cartoon published in <i>LIFE</i> magazine, published September 19, 1912. Pen and ink on thin board. 675x560 mm; 26Â½x22 inches (sheet). Unsigned. Tipped to mount; matted. See condition report. <br><br>Literature: Violet and Denis Kitchen, <i>Madness in Crwods, The Teeming Mind of Harrison Cady,</i> Beehive Books, 2019. Page 96.<br><br>This cartoon by Cady riffs on Jonathan Swift's famous satirical novel <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> by comparing the influx of Jewish immigrants into New York City to Gulliver and the Lilliputians. Cady drew upon stereotypes to depict the tiny Jewish men, rendered with exaggerated large and curved noses, who appear preoccupied with taking over the economy and turning a profit on everything from Gulliver's curly hair and hat, which they cut with saws and scissors, to the very land they inhabit that has been renamed \"New Jerusalem.\"<br><br>Like many illustrators of his day, Cady's work sometimes reflected commonly held prejudices and several of Cady's illustrations leading up to World War I are tinged with the anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant sentiments seen here. It is not known if Cady shared these problematic views, or if he was carrying out the opinions of his publishers and their requirements for assignments."
