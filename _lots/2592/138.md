DESCRIPT: MANUEL ORAZI (1860-1934)
CROSSHEAD: Art Nouveau Woman with Sunflower Headdress. * Art Nouveau Woman Holding
  Kettle.
year: ''
TYPESET: "<p>Together, original painting and original study for unidentified projects,
  likely unpublished. Mixed media, including watercolor, gouache, metallic paint,
  and pencil on paper. The first is 630x500 mm; 24¾x19½ inches (sheet). Firmly adhered
  to linen board. Signed with Orazi's monogram in lower left image; not dated. The
  second is 625x370 mm; 24½x18½ inches (sheet). Adhered to thick paper mount. Unsigned;
  not dated. Each matted and with simple gold-painted wood frames, study is missing
  glass. <br><br>The figure in the first and more finished artwork resembles Princesse
  Lointaine, who was famously played by Sarah Bernhardt and whose elaborate tiara
  adorned with lilies was immortalized and widely reproduced in imagery by poster
  artist Alphonse Mucha. While the sunflowers pictured here negate the likelihood
  of the artwork being intended as an image of the Princesse Lointaine, it certainly
  contains tropes and decorative elements quintessential to Orazi's oeuvre and the
  Art Nouveau style as a whole, such as use of sinuous curves and the intricate headdress,
  which he gives careful attention, likely due to his background as a jewelry designer.
  Orazi's jewelry was displayed at Samuel Bing's famed Maison de l'Art Nouveau in
  1896, and his designs were also sold at La Maison Moderne. <br><br>Though it differs
  in the details and overall composition, the original study bears resemblance to
  Orazi's famous lithograph <em>Femme aux Orchidées (Nymph with Orchids)</em> in its
  rendering of a silhouette of a woman in profile with long tendrils of hair blowing
  in the wind. <br><br>Born in Italy, Orazi primarily worked in Paris creating graphic
  art in the Art Nouveau style and illustrations for advertisements, posters, calendars,
  books, and newspapers.<br><br>Such original studies by Orazi are uncommon on the
  market and highly desirable.</p>"
