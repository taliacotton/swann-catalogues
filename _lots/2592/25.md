  illustrating for Harper's, The Century Magazine, McClure's, Vanity Fair, and The
  Saturday Evening Post. Its beginnings, however, were mired in a rather infamous
  industry scandal when her mother, then assistant editor under Theodore Dreiser at
  &lt;I&gt;The Delineator,&lt;M&gt; ended the famous author's infatuation with Thelma
  by sending her off to Europe. Though the incident cost Dreiser his job at the time,
  he and Cudlipp remained friendly until his death and his connections helped advance
  her career. Cudlipp was also fascinated with and collected pre-Columbian sculpture,
  a subject about which she wrote and lectured to promote its importance.</p>
