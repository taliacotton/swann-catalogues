  Decorative wood frame. <br><br>Born Marjorie McMein, the artist changed her name
  to "Neysa" after moving to New York City to pursue a brief acting career. She studied
  at The School of The Art Institute of Chicago and at the Art Students League. After
  selling her first drawing to the <i>Boston Star</i>, McMein began illustrating covers
  for <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> in 1915 where her covers featuring glamorous
  and fashionable young women quickly gained popularity and brought her many more
  commissions for the leading magazines of the day, including <i>Collier's</i>, <i>McClure's</i>,
  <i>Liberty</i>, and <i>Woman's Home Companion</i>. During World War I, McMein was
  commissioned to create propaganda posters for the governments of the United States
  and France, as well as to design fundraising posters for the Red Cross and YMCA.
  From 1923 to 1937, she produced all the covers for <i>McCall's</i>. She also created
  advertisements for leading brands like Lucky Strike, Palmolive, and Betty Crocker,
  for which she produced a portrait of the fictional home baker. When magazines began
  reducing costs by replacing expensive commissioned illustrations with the cheaper
  medium of photography, McMein pivoted from her commercial career and primarily painted
  commissioned portraits. <br><br>McMein was an ardent supporter of women's suffrage
  and was known to be fiercely independent with an active social life, which sometimes
  pushed the boundaries of propriety. She was inducted into the Society of Illustrators
  Hall of Fame in 1984, 35 years after her death.
