Mixed media, including watercolor, tempera, pen, with collage, on paper. 158x210 mm; 6¼x8¼ inches, on 12x9-inch sheet. Signed \"Jane Breskin Zalben\" in lower right margin. Archivally tipped to matte. Accompanied by a first edition of the book and a copy of the newly issued First Chinese Edition (2020), both signed by Zalben.<br><br>This image of Janson painting her version of Vincent van Gogh's \"The Starry Night\" appears on page 24, before the artist added captions to the Dalí art rendering in the background. Zalben's book Mousterpiece was a runaway hit, especially at museums where art programs for children regularly use the story of a small mouse named Janson (after art historian H. W. Janson) to introduce them to the modern masters. Janson lives in a museum and learns to paint in the style of Albers, Rousseau, Warhol, Picasso and others until she creates her own original work, her \"mousterpiece,\" and thus \"arriving\" as an artist. The book was listed on The Horn Book's \"Calling Caldecott\" list among other accolades."
