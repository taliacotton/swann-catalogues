Unsigned but with printing instructions and measurements in Gorey's hand.<br><br><i>The Dark Beasts</i> was Belmont Books' second collection of Belknap's Cthulhu Mythos tales. Gorey's artwork perfectly depicts the descriptive double-sided text for the cult classic that appeared on the rear cover of the book, slithering between the dark beasts: \"For the first time in paperback, Strangled Frogs, Shrinking Turtles, A naked nymph with hair like hissing snakes, A microscopic human shape from outer space, Blue oranges, Pink tentacles, Gnores, Unthings, A tax on monogamy collected by Cro-Magnon giants . . . and other ingredients in the weirdest collection of far-out tales by one of the masters of science fiction.\""
