  City: Illustrated Maps of NYC” New York Public Library, September 2017-April 2018.</p><p>Meyerowitz''s
  highly amusing architectural map describing what life could be like in New York
  in the year 2118 was created for the NYPL show and won the silver medal at the Society
  of Illustrators in 2018. </p><p>The insets along the top featuring "Great Moments
  in Starchitecture" which serve as a visual border are spot-on in their humorous
  interpretations of fantastical NYC buildings and structures by modern architects.
  Throughout Meyerowitz''s cityscape, floods have turned streets into waterways, rendering
  districts into separate islands such as "Grand Canal Street" which cuts off "Tribewa
  (Triangle Below Water)" from Battery Park Reef, next to which "Financial Straits"
  and its "Outer Banks" sit near "Staten Rock." The stroller-strewn sidewalks of Cobble
  Hill and Brooklyn Heights have turned all of Brooklyn into "Land-O-Babies," and
  midtown modernist skyscrapers are now simply the "Oligarch District" flanked by
  "Museum Marsh" and "Central Puddle." One could spend hours discovering the amusing
  details hiding throughout this brilliant brainchild of the ever-creative illustrator
  and National Lampoon icon.</p>'
