  and prolific children’s illustrator, notable for his realistic depictions of animals.  Garbutt
  led animal life drawing classes for Disney studio animators at the Los Angeles Zoo.
  These classes were crucial to the Disney staff improving their drawing skills, which
  enabled them to create <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i>, <i>Bambi</i>, <i>Dumbo</i>,
  and many other classic films.  Garbutt’s contributions were so significant that
  Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston dedicated a section of their book <i>Disney Animation:
  The Illusion of Life</i> to him (New York: Hyperion, 1981).'
