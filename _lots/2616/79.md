TYPESET: 'Oil on linen canvas, circa 1971-74. 1219x1254 mm; 48x60 inches.<br><br>Provenance:
  acquired directly from the artist, private collection, AZ, thence by descent private
  collection, AZ.<br><br>The Red Sea is a monumental landscape by Louis B. Sloan that
  is inspired by the crossing of the Red Sea, an episode in the biblical narrative
  of The Exodus. Here, Sloan uses a variety of brushwork, drips, and splatter in a
  plethora of greys, white and blue to compose mountain-like waves and a shadow of
  figures crossing the Red Sea. The power and drama of the painting are akin to 19th
  Century depictions of the biblical event. Sloan is best known for his plein air
  landscape painting with similar dramatic depictions of natural phenomena, including
  his well known Gathering Storm Over Philadelphia, circa 1961, in the collection
  of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia.'
