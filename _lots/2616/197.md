  of all strains of cotton.<br><br>Born in Orange, NJ, Butler graduated Cum Laude
  from Howard University with a BFA degree. During her education at Howard, she refined
  her natural talents under the tutelage of lecturers such as Loïs Mailou Jones, Elizabeth
  Catlett, Jeff Donaldson, and Ernie Barnes. Butler then went on to earn an MFA from
  Montclair State University in 2005. Butler was a high school art teacher for ten
  years in the Newark Public Schools and three years at Columbia High School in Maplewood,
  New Jersey. While obtaining her MFA, Butler took a Fiber Arts class where she had
  an artistic epiphany relating to how she expresses her art. "As a child, I was always
  watching my mother and grandmother sew, and they taught me. After that class, I
  made a portrait quilt for my grandmother on her deathbed, and I have been making
  art quilts ever since."<br><br>Butler''s work was recently the focus of a solo exhibition
  Bisa Butler: Portraits at the Art Institute of Chicago, the second stop of a traveling
