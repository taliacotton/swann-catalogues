  from the action * The Debauchees dance down the hill, the Woman in Red falls further
  behind.<br><br>Rivers, First Draft was a single, unique performance created by Lorraine
  O’Grady for “Art Across the Park,” curated by Gilbert Coker and Horace Brockington.
  It was performed in the Loch, a northern section of Central Park, on August 18,
  1982, and was a “collage-in-space,” with different actions taking place simultaneously
  on two sides of the stream and further up the hill. The narratives being told were
  competing for attention, simultaneously uniting two different heritages, the Caribbean
  and New England, and three different ages and aspects of the self, a young girl,
  a teenager, and an adult woman. It was a three-ring circus of movement and sound
  that, unlike the randomness of Futurists attempting to shout each other down, played
  more like a unitary dream.<br><br>The pivotal moment of Rivers, First Draft occurs
  after the Woman in Red has been ejected by the Black Male Artists from their closed
  studio: she descends to the stream bank where she sees a white stove and claims
  it by painting it red. The figures are actively guided by the male New England figure,
  the Nantucket Memorial statue, while the female Caribbean figure, the Woman in White,
  continues to endlessly grate coconut, calmly indifferent to the scene unfolding
  below. The performance was seen by a small invited audience, mostly friends from
  Just Above Midtown, and occasional pedestrians walking through the seldom visited
  Loch. <br><br>Summary courtesy of the artist's website.</p>"
