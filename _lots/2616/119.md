  painter, printmaker and designer, Nefertiti earned her Master of Fine Arts degree
  at the Rhode Island School of Design.  Describing her unique approach to the relief
  print, art critic Dr. Richard Powell of Duke University described her work as follows:
  "Embellishing the linoleum''s surface with virtually every kind of possible cut,
  yet leaving areas for visual oasis, (Nefertiti Goodman takes) linoleum cut the most
  basic of relief mediums over new ground, and to loftier heights."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p><p>Nefertiti
  completed five paintings and seven intricate hand-painted ceramic tile panels which
  were permanently installed for the new Criminal Justice Center in Philadelphia during
  the late 90''s.  This commission project was under the auspices of the Philadelphia
  Per Cent for Art Program. Nefertiti is also a past recipient of the New Jersey State
  Council on the Arts Fellowship for printmaking. Her works have been exhibited in
  parts of the US, Canada, Eastern Europe, South America and Southeast Asia; including
  the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, DeCordova Museum, Montclair Art Museum, Smithsonian
  (SITES), the Studio Museum in Harlem, Taipei Museum of Fine Arts, the Schomburg
  Center for Research in Black Culture, and other noted institutional and corporate
  collections.</p>'
