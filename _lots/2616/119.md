DESCRIPT: NEFERTITI GOODMAN (1950 - )
CROSSHEAD: The Aftermath.
TYPESET: "<p>Linoleum cut on cream wove paper, 1982. 927x708 mm; 36½x27⅞ inches, full
  margins. Signed, titled, dated and numbered 35/125 in pencil, lower margin.<br><br>Creating
  reliefs using battleship linoleum, Nefertiti Goodman creates large, exquisitely
  produced prints. Born Cynthia Freeman Nefertiti Goodman, she studied at the Massachusetts
  College of Art and received a BFA in 1974 and an MFA in 1977 at the Rhode Island
  School of Design. After graduating, she taught at the Elma Lewis School of Fine
  Art in Roxbury, but after receiving a printmaking fellowship from the New Jersey
  Council on the Arts, she left Boston for Nutley, New Jersey. Goodman focuses her
  printmaking process on black and white imagery and incorporates contrasting patterns
  in her works, sometimes within the subject and other times as a border to contain
  the image as in The Aftermath.<br><br>Her first major exhibition came in 1975 at
  The Museum of NCAAA (National Center of Afro-American Artists), National Arts Club,
  NY, although she was included in a group exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts,
  Boston the previous year. She also exhibited in <em>Jubilee: Afro-American Artists
  on Afro-America,</em> Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1975.</p>"
