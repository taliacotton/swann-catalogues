Signed in pencil, lower right.<br><br>Provenance: acquired from Sande Webster Gallery, Philadelphia; private collection, PA.<br><br>Eric Mack's ongoing body of work utilizes multi-media and complex compositions centered around urban design. Using a grid as a framework to create his artworks, he creates intricate collages from graphic images before handcoloring. This early work shows how he investigates multi-media as the springboard for his practice.<br><br>Mack creates mathematically based renderings with a distinctly post-modern approach. His multimedia artworks are informed with superimposed grids, patterns, and portals. Layered surfaces are created with paint, found objects, natural fibers, and synthetic substrates that explore the systems of our visual world. In 1998, Mack received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Illustration from the Atlanta College of Art, which was absorbed by Savannah College of Art and Design in 2006. Recent solo exhibitions include Ordo Naturalis, The Albany Museum of Art, GA 2022; Of Stone and Stem, Whitespace Gallery, GA, 2021, and Impossible Architectures, Stone Center, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, 2016."
