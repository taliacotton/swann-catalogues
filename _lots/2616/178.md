DESCRIPT: HUGHIE LEE-SMITH (1915 - 1999)
CROSSHEAD: The End (The Pink Door).
TYPESET: 'Oil on linen canvas, 1998. 1016x1270 mm; 40x50 inches. Signed in oil, lower
  right.<br><br>Provenance: the estate of the artist; thence by descent to a private
  collection.<br><br>The End is a bold and dramatic painting from Hughie Lee-Smith''s
  late series of works inspired by the theatre. His depictions of figures in imaginary,
  staged environments recall Lee-Smith''s early experiences of dance and theatre while
  working at the Playhouse Settlement (named Karamu House in 1941) during the WPA
  period in Cleveland. Lee-Smith taught art at Karamu House in the late 1930s in return
  for the full scholarship to the Cleveland School of Art (now the Art Institute of
  Cleveland) that the Gilpin Players awarded him in 1935.<br><br>The End is a striking
  painting from this ultimate period of Lee-Smith''s oeuvre. With both the figures
  hidden or turned from the viewer, the only faces on view are the images of a Greek
  tragedy mask and an African mask painted on the set. The compressed space and floating
  elements further create a metaphysical, dream-like space that reflects the lasting
  influence of Giorgio De Chirico. The End is also a very personal reflection on mortality.
  Painted after his move to Albuquerque in 1997, Lee-Smith was fighting his final
  battle with cancer at the time - he passed away on February 23, 1999 at the age
  of 83.'
