  private collection.<br><br>Rise People Rise. is an important mid-career painting
  by artist, activist and art therapist Cliff Joseph. It is a powerful political and
  artistic statement created at the height of the Black Arts movement. As a founding
  member of the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition in New York, Joseph was working
  at the vanguard of a transformative moment in African American art and history.<br><br>Born
  in 1922 in Panama City where his father was employed in the construction of the
  Panama Canal, Joseph''s family emigrated to the United States the following year,
  settling in Harlem. Following military service in the Army artillery and WWII, he
  studied at the Pratt Institute in New York, receiving a degree in illustration in
  1952.<br><br>Cliff Joseph best described his practice of painting: "the power of
  the art belongs to the people." By 1968, both his painting and activism were reaching
  new heights. That year, Joseph painted one of his best known works, My Country Right
  or Wrong, a powerful anti-war statement. In 1968, Joseph also co-founded the Black
  Emergency Cultural Coalition (BECC) with Benny Andrews, Henri Ghent, Reggie Gammon,
  Mahler Ryde and Edward Taylor. Faith Ringgold also became a member of BECC. Its
  founding was a direct response to the Metropolitan Museum of Art''s controversial
  exhibition Harlem on My Mind which did not include any Black painters or scultpure.
  Its goal was to increase the representation of Black artists in New York galleries
  and museums. Joseph and the BECC went on to also protest the Whitney Museum of American
  Art exhibition Contemporary Black Artists in America, and organized the exhibition
  Rebuttal to Whitney Museum Exhibition at the Acts of Art Gallery in Manhattan.<br><br>Joseph
  was also one of the first African Americans to join the professional practice of
  art therapy, and the first African American to join the American Art Therapy Association.
  He practiced art therapy at Lincoln Hospital and was on staff at the Albert Einstein
  College of Medicine in New York.<br><br>Joseph''s iconic Blackboard, 1969, with
  its vision of an Afro-centric education, was recently included in the important
  traveling exhibition Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power organized by
  curators Mark Godfrey and Zoe Whitely at the Tate Modern, London. Rise People Rise
  is the most significant and largest painting of Cliff Joseph to come to auction
  to date.'
