  by descent, private collection, Florida.<br><br>Daniel Webster Perkins (1879 - 1972)
  was a prominent attorney in Florida and one of the state''s first African American
  lawyers, having been officially admitted to the Florida Bar in 1914. After practicing
  law in Knoxville, Tennessee and Tampa, Florida, he settled in Jacksonville in 1919,
  where he practiced until his death in 1972. Mr. Perkins was a strong proponent of
  civil rights and a community leader; in 1968, the former Colored Lawyers Association
  of Jacksonville changed its name to the D.W. Perkins Bar Association in honor of
  Perkins, who had been a founding member. During a family vacation to the 1939 World’s
  Fair, Perkins purchased Savage''s souvenir replica.<br><br>Exhibited: Through Our
  Eyes 2000; Lift Every Voice and Sing, the Ritz Theatre LaVilla Museum, Jacksonville,
  Florida, February 8, 2000. <br><br>Augusta (Christine Fells) Savage was born in
  Green Cove Springs, just south of Jacksonville. After first exhibiting her sculpture
  in Palm Beach and Jacksonville, Savage moved to New York to study sculpture. She
  was admitted to the Cooper Union School of Art in 1921, and completed the four year
  course in three years. In 1929 and 1931, Savage was the recipient of two successive
  Rosenwald Grants, which enabled her to travel to France and study at the Académie
  de la Grande Chaumière in Paris. When she returned to New York in 1932, she opened
  the Savage School of Arts and Crafts in Harlem, where her students included William
  Artis, Jacob Lawrence and Norman Lewis. In 1935, she was a founding member of the
  Harlem Artists Guild, and from 1936 - 1937 she worked for the WPA Federal Arts Project
  as the Director of the Harlem Community Art Center. <br><br>A life-size version
  of Lift Every Voice and Sing was commissioned by the 1939 New York World''s Fair
  committee in 1937. Savage left the WPA to work on this monumental project, inspired
  by Jacksonville brothers James Weldon and Rosamund Johnson''s anthem Lift Every
  Voice. Her iconic sculpture stood almost 16-foot high, in painted, cast plaster
  on the grounds of the fair. Sadly, the original work was destroyed when the fair
  was over - it is known today only from photographs and these smaller versions which
  were cast by the artist to be sold as souvenirs.'
