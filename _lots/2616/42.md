  is a significant mid-century painting by Felrath Hines - a scarce large canvas from
  his first abstract period. Born in Indianapolis, Hines studied painting and design
  at the Art Institute of Chicago, where he befriended artist Charles Sebree. Inspired
  by Sebree, Hines moved from Chicago to New York in 1946. In the 1950s, he quietly
  developed an organic abstraction idiom while working in the shop of master framer
  Robert M. Kulicke. Through this close contact with the art world, Hines was both
  introduced to many other artists and his future career in art conservation.<br><br>Hines
  achieved critical recognition for these beautiful, painterly abstractions of nature
  with two solo exhibitions at Parma Gallery in 1957 and 1959, and his inclusion in
  group exhibitions at the John Heller Gallery and Parma Gallery in New York and the
  Barnett Aden Gallery in Washington, DC in the 1950s. In the late 1950s, Hines also
  met Romare Bearden, with whom he would later become a founding member of the Spiral
  Group in 1963. Several paintings from this breakthrough period of abstraction are
  now in institutional collections; including Transition, 1953, Museum of Fine Arts,
  Boston, Hanging Garden, 1954, SFMOMA, Untitled (Abstraction), circa 1960, Crystal
  Bridges Museum of American Art, and Untitled, 1960, Indianapolis Museum of Art.'
