Craig. Afro-American Artists 1800-1969, p. 22;  Edmund Barry Gaither, Five Famous Black Artists, p. 7.<br><br>This vibrant canvas is an excellent example of Hale Woodruff's postwar painting in which he described landscape and natural phenomena within the idiom of Abstract Expressionism. This significant and striking canvas shows Woodruff's continued evolution as an abstract painter through the 1960s. In addition to continuing his Celestial Gate series, Woodruff created some of his most abstract painting as landscapes. Landscape is typical of Woodruff's late 1960s compositions with bold, horizontal strokes over layers of both earthy and jewel-like colors. Other significant 1967 paintings are in institutional collections, including Ancestral Memory, the Detroit Institute of the Arts and Figure, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York."
