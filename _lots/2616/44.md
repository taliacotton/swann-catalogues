DESCRIPT: EARL HOOKS (1927 - 2005)
CROSSHEAD: Untitled.
TYPESET: 'Thrown and hand-built glazed stoneware, 1957. Approximately 431x203x216
  mm; 17x8x8Â½ inches. Signed and dated in pencil on the underside.<br><br>Provenance:
  private collection, New York.<br><br>This large, modernist vessel featuring wonderful
  biomorphic shapes epitomizes Earl Hooks''s mid-career work in ceramics. It displays
  his commitment to exploring the relationships between design, balance, and form.
  Hooks rose to prominence due to his application of naturally occurring shapes to
  functional sculptures. His works take on bulbous shapes with intentional ceramic
  inclusions and a matte glaze that scatters reflected light in dispersed directions.<br><br>Hooks
  was one of the most significant Black ceramic artists of the 20th Century and the
  founder of Studio A, one of the country''s first Black-owned and operated fine arts
  galleries in Gary, Indiana. Born August 2, 1927, in Baltimore, Hooks received a
  BA degree from Howard University in 1949, attended Catholic University in Washington,
  DC, from 1949-51, and then received graduate certificates from both the Rochester
  Institute of Technology in 1954 and the School of American Craftsman in New York
  in ceramics in 1955. He served as both professor and chair of the art department
  at Fisk University from 1961-67.'
