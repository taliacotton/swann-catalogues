Printed for the Hourglass Project, Caversham Press, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa.<br><br>The Hourglass Project, 1999 was a residency founded by Caversham Press that invited 15 women artists, including Mildred Thompson, to create artworks \"in the spirit of international exchange through creative work\" and as an even exchange of ideas between local and international artists. Thompson conceived Advancing Impulses 36 as a continuation of her study and application of scientific phenomena, applying mathematics and physics, much like fellow Washington, DC artist, Alma Thomas. <br><br>Thompson began formal artistic training at Howard University in 1953, studying under James A. Porter--artist, instructor of painting and drawing, chairman of the art department and director of the Howard University Gallery of Art. After graduation, Porter continued to advise Thompson and suggested she study in Germany.<br><br>Thompson developed her innovative forms of abstraction in printmaking and wood construction while living between Cologne and Aachen. In 1973, Thompson had a one-person exhibition at the Neue Galerie in Aachen. An oil on canvas work from the Advancing Impulses series was recently exhibited in Never Done: 100 Years of Women in Politics and Beyond at The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College, September 17, 2020 - June 6, 2021.
