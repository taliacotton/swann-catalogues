Signed and numbered 2/5 in pencil, lower margin.<br><br>Provenance: acquired from G. R. N'Namdi Gallery, Chicago, private collection, New York (2000).<br><br>Larry is part of Rashid Johnson's Seeing in the Dark series of portraits of homeless men in Chicago executed with a large format camera between 1997 - 1999. His subject's names are the titles of the artworks. They are given agency and made visible beyond the fringe of society. Johnson's use of the Van Dyke Brown process, an early photographic technique with mineral-like pigments that dates from the mid-19th century, gives these portraits a unique richness and depth. Photographs from the Seeing in the Dark series are held by numerous institutions, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Detroit Institute of Arts, and the Art Institute of Chicago."
