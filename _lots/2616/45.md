  Smith, "Romare Bearden''s Seen Abstract Side", The New York Times, March 19, 2020.<br><br>Wine
  Star is an excellent and significant example from Romare Bearden''s period of abstract
  color field painting of the late 1950s. Bearden''s development of abstraction was
  influenced by non-Western intuitive approaches to imagery. In the mid-1950s, Bearden
  had an interest in Zen Buddhism and studied calligraphy and Chinese landscape painting
  with a Chinese calligrapher. His late 1950s works display less of an interest in
  the activity of action painting of expressionism, as described by his friend the
  writer Harry Henderson in a 1989 interview - "He found a rationale by studying Zen
  philosophy. His works were always serene and lacked the tremendous physical involvement
  employed by the Abstract Expressionists." Sharon Patton also described a "mystical
  elegance" in these abstract works, and the influence of Chinese painting is found
  in their asymmetry and an entry point into the painting. Patton illustrates this
  phase with Bearden''s Blue is the Smoke of War, White the Bones of Men, circa 1960,
  from the Harry B. Henderson collection and sold at Swann Galleries on September
  15, 2005. <br><br>Bearden''s abstract painting impresses with its vital fluidity
  and technical virtuosity. Roberta Smith''s rave review of the 2020 DC Moore exhibition
  of Abstract Romare Bearden posits his abstract painting''s significance; "they effortlessly
  claim a place in the history of American postwar abstraction, stain painting division."
  These beautiful paintings embrace accident, staining and the canvas through a technique
  of pouring, staining, dispersion and dripping. While Bearden''s period of experimental
  painting is later than the mid-1950s celebrated color field painting of Morris Louis
  and Helen Frankenthaler, his experimentation was independent; as Smith put it simply,
  "Bearden developed it on his own". This notable chapter in his development has been
  largely overlooked until recently. The abstraction of Bearden is now the subject
  of a national traveling museum exhibition organized at the Neuberger Museum of Art
  by its director Tracy Fitzpatrick. Fine p. 222; Gelburd/Rosenberg p. 40; Patton
