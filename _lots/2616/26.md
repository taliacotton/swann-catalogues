DESCRIPT: NORMAN LEWIS (1909 - 1979)
CROSSHEAD: Untitled.
TYPESET: 'Oil on cotton canvas, 1947. 768x406 mm; 30Â¼x16 inches. Signed and dated
  "3-47" in oil, lower right.<br><br>Provenance: acquired directly from the artist,
  private collection, New York; thence by descent, private collection, North Carolina.<br><br>This
  modernist oil painting is a striking and scarce example of the earliest abstraction
  by Norman Lewis, from his first full year painting completely abstract. By fall
  1946, Lewis joined the Marian Willard Gallery in New York, and began a new series
  of linear abstract paintings in the spring of 1947. Untitled is closely related
  to his Magenta Haze and Twilight Sounds, collection of the St. Louis Museum of Art,
  each dated March 1947. Their ground''s distinct color adds atmosphere to each composition.
  At this time,  Norman Lewis was also clearly inspired by jazz and improvisation--Duke
  Ellington wrote his blues-inflected composition Magenta Haze in 1946. His first
  solo exhibition at the Willard Gallery in 1949 included six paintings from 1947:
  Magenta Haze, Spring, Street Scene, Subway, Reflection and Twilight Sounds. Other
  notable 1947 paintings in are Autumn, collection of the Worcester Art Museum, <Changing
  Moods, the Mott-Warsh Collection and Meeting, the collection of Raymond J. McGuire.'
