Signed and dated in pencil, lower edge.<br><br>Provenance: acquired directly from the artist, private collection, New York.<br><br>Born in Pleasantville, NJ, Frank W. Wimberley has produced a significant body of work in abstraction with paint and collage. Wimberley studied art with James A. Porter, Loïs Mailou Jones, and James Lesesne Wells at Howard University. While a student, he also played jazz and later developed friendships with musicians such as Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, and Ron Carter in New York, who also informed his creative sensibility. The artist expressed that his use of found papers, objects and torn paper was influenced by the physical qualities of collage by Pablo Picasso and Antoni Tàpies utilized in their works of the late 1960s and 70s. The artist has infused the formal qualities of abstraction with tension from the torn edges of the paper and cardboard."
