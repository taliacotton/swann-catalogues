  The Gallery of Modern Art, New York, NY, December 3, 1968 - January 5, 1969. This
  retrospective, sponsored by Farleigh Dickinson University, included 53 paintings
  and 3 sculptures by Alston, including all eight of the Black and White paintings.
  They were exhibited alongside his other important series African Theme,Blues Singer
  and Family from the 1950s and 60s in the new New York museum designed by Edward
  Durell Stone at 2 Columbus Circle. In their chapter on Charles Alston, Romare Bearden
  and Harry Henderson wrote that Alston "considered the black and white abstractions
  in the retrospective of 1968 to be amongst his most important he had done."<br><br>Black
  and White #3 is a striking and beautiful abstraction by Alston, a significant work
  from his important series of eight abstract paintings between 1959 and 1961. By
  1960, Alston achieved wide recognition for his post war painting, including the
  Emily Lowe Memorial award for An Ancient Place, and a solo exhibition at Feingarten
  Galleries, New York that year. Like his friend Norman Lewis, Alston found the limited
  palette of black and white provided both aesthetic and narrative themes that enabled
  his abstraction to reflect a social and political consciousness. Alston and Lewis
  both effectively gave the color black new meaning at the height of the Civil Rights
  era struggles. In Black and White #3, Alston masterfully creates a dynamic composition
  through a great variety of applications of black paint on the white ground - from
  impastoed strokes to thin wash. His experimental approach includes dispersal, blotting
  and monotype.<br><br>Another painting from this series, Black and White II, circa
  1960 is in the collection of the Studio Museum in Harlem. Two other known paintings
  from this series are illustrated in Alvia J. Wardlaw''s Charles Alston monograph,
  Black and White #1, 1959 and Black and White #7, 1961, which was also included in
  the Brooklyn Museum 2015 traveling exhibition Witness: Art and Civil Rights in the
  Sixties. Black and White #8 was sold at Swann Galleries on December 12, 2020.<br><br>The
  Black and White series also laid the foundation for Alston''s work in Spiral. As
  a founding member of the artist''s group in the summer of 1963, Alston, alongside
  the other abstract painters Lewis, Merton Simpson and Hale Woodruff, advocated for
  an art that could address Black identity and the social and political issues confronting
  African Americans during the Civil Rights struggle. The Spiral group''s first and
  only exhibition First Group Showing: Works in Black and White, May 14 - June 5,
  1965, continued his monochromatic theme. Bearden/Henderson, Jr., p. 269; Wardlaw
  p. 91 and 93.'
