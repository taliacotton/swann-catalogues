TYPESET: 'Carved marble, mounted on a granite base, circa 1950 -1955. Approximately
  330x241x51 mm; 11 3/4x9Â½x2 inches (not including the base). Incised signature on
  the backside.<br><br>Provenance: private collection, Chicago; private collection,
  South Carolina; private collection (2012).<br><br>This marble carving is an exceptional
  and extremely scarce work of the great Chicago sculptor Marion Perkins. Born in
  Marche, Arkansas, at the age of eight, Perkins was sent to live with relatives on
  the South Side of Chicago in 1916. Marion Perkins attended Wendell Phillips High
  School, the first Chicago high school where the majority of the students were African
  American. He soon married Eva Gillon, who became his model and muse; they had three
  sons and settled in Bronzeville. While interested in theatre and literature, Perkins
  worked a series of menial jobs to support his family until he acquired a newstand
  in the late 1930s. Perkins then had the resources and time to create an outdoor
  studio in his backyard. Not only a talented stone carver, the self-taught artist
  also carved in wood, and modelled in clay, plaster and steel wire.<br><br>Perkins
  first gained attention in 1940 with two stone works included in the American Negro
  Exposition. With the opening of the Southside Community Art Center that year, Perkins
  had an artistic venue where he could both exhibit and teach; he soon became an important
  figure of the Chicago Renaissance. His first triumph was being invited to exhibit
  at the Art Institute of Chicago''s prestigious Annual Exhibition of American Art
  in 1942 where he showed his powerful limestone carving John Henry. After participating
  in several invitational exhibitions, in 1947 the IBM Corporation acquired his Figure
  at Rest. Then in 1948, his beautiful marble Ethiopia Awakening won the prize in
  sculpture at the Art Institute''s Annual Exhibition of Artists of Chicago and Vicinity,
  and Perkins was awarded an esteemed Julius Rosenwald Fund fellowship grant.<br><br>Perkins''s
  direct approach to stone sculpture is epitomized by his iconic 1950 Man of Sorrows.
  This powerful African American head of Christ with a crown of thorns was the sensation
  of the 1951 annual Chicago artists invitational at the Art Institute; it was featured
  in an Ebony magazine profile, and acquired by the museum. Perkins often found such
  fine materials in vacant lots and abandoned houses on the South Side. With Untitled
  (Head of a King), Perkins was not deterred by the narrowness of the marble slab
  - he rendered this regal head in three dimensions by carving the profile in the
  thin outer edges. This distintictively modern approach, influenced by Brancusi and
  Modigliani, is also seen in his pair of limestone heads, Don Quixote and Sancho
  Panza, circa 1955. Despite these successes and widespread acclaim in Chicago, Perkins
  never received national recognition.<br><br> His sculptures are found in the collections
  of the Art Institute of Chicago, the DuSable Black History Museum and Education
  Center, and the National Gallery. Marion Perkins continues to exert his influence
  on contemporary art today. Kerry James Marshall''s monumental picture, Souvenir
  III, 1998 includes a homage to the artist in his painting, along with Bob Thompson,
  Zora Neale Hurston, Dorthy Dandridge, and Augusta Savage. Perkins/Flug/Lusenhop
