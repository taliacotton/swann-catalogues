TYPESET: "Casein on board, 1991. 533x812 mm; 21x32 inches. Signed and dated in casein, lower right.<br><br>Provenance: collection of the artist; private collection.<br><br>This fully developed study from Melvin Clark was painted to produce the large mosaic mural he created for Brooklyn's Public School 152 in 1996. Submitted to New York City Percent for Art in 1991, the work consists of two mosaic tile murals. Enchanted Dreams is a surreal composition comprised of semi-abstract musicians and animals in various modes of dance and expression. The other panel, Sun Bird, focuses on a large abstract bird serenaded under a bright sun by an equally abstract horn player. Both panels are fabricated with colorful mosaic tiles. Clark's works are found today in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Modern African Arts Gallery, Amsterdam, the Printmaking Workshop, New York, the Lower East Side Printshop, New York, the Detroit Board of Education and the Pehl Collection, Eldersburg, MD."
