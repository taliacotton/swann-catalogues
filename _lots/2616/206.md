  he befriended artists Fred Brown, Lorenzo Pace, Jack Whitten, Joe Overstreet and
  Bob Blackburn, whom he later joined to study printmaking at the Printmakers Workshop
  from 1992 - 1993. He exhibited in galleries in Sag Harbor and Riverhead, New York
  in the 1990s, and had a solo exhibition at the Montclair University, Montclair,
  NJ in 1997. He has experienced a recent revival with a solo exhibition at Gerald
  Peters Gallery in 2015. In addition, his artworks have been accepted into several
