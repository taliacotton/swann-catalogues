Edition of 4000.<br><br>Each year, the Peter Norton family commissions an art edition to celebrate the holidays. The book was privately published and gifted to friends. Another copy of this book is in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.<br><br>Through the use of a pop-up book, Kara Walker takes a medium typically relegated to young children's entertainment, and writes of a, \"soon-to-be emancipated 19th century Negress.\" What begins as a seemingly hopeful story of a free life written in the mode of a fairy tale quickly mimics her dark and provocative imagery. Freedom, A Fable, details the racial and sexual horrors experienced by African American women in the 19th century."
