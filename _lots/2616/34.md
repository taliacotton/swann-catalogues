DESCRIPT: CHARLES WHITE (1918 - 1979)
CROSSHEAD: Folk Singer.
TYPESET: 'Linoleum cut on artificial Japan paper, 1957. 907x455 mm; 35Â¾x18 inches,
  full margins. Edition of 30. Signed, titled, dated and inscribed "Ed/30" in pencil,
  lower margin.<br><br>In this wonderfully expressive linoleum cut, Charles White
  reinterprets his iconic 1957 ink drawing Folk Singer (Voice of Jericho: Portait
  of Harry Belafonte).<br><br>Harry Belafonte was a important figure to Charles White
  - a friend, patron, collaborator and inspiration. In the late 1950s, White made
  musicians, singers and actors the subjects of his work--from the famous to the anonymous.
  While they had met in the early 1950s through their membership in the Committee
  for the Negro Arts, White and Belafonte became close friends and collaborated often
  once White moved to California. Andrea Barnwell describes how "with a generous gift
  from their dear friend Harry Belafonte," Frances and White rented a house from friends
  on Summit Avenue in Pasadena in 1956, before they moved to nearby Altadena. Belafonte
  also wrote the introduction to White''s 1958 ACA Gallery exhibition catalogue when
  he first exhibited Folk Singer, and the foreword to the 1967 book Images of Dignity:
  The Drawings of Charles White. In the latter, Belafonte describes the profound connection
  he made to the work of Charles White: "You are enriched by the experience of having
  known Charles White''s people, who are like characters from a great novel that remain
  with you long after the pages of the book have been closed." Through White''s hand,
  we become familiar with this great singer.<br><br>This is a very scarce print and
  only the second to appear at auction. While the intended edition was inscribed as
  30, Lucinda Gedeon noted an edition of 25. We know the location of only a few other
  impressions of Folk Singer. An impression, titled Voice of Jericho and dated 1958,
  in the collection of the Baltimore Museum of Art was exhibited in the recent travelling
  exhibition Charles White: A Retrospective. Oehler/Adler pl. 79, cat. 59; Barnwell
  p. 61; Gedeon Eb 12; Horowitz p. 1.'
