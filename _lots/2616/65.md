DESCRIPT: NORMAN LEWIS (1909 - 1979)
CROSSHEAD: Untitled (Abstraction in Orange).
TYPESET: 'Oil on linen canvas, 1967. 1460x965 mm; 57Â½x38 inches. Signed and dated
  in oil, lower left.<br><br>Provenance: private collection, New York; thence by descent,
  private collection, New York. <br><br>This bright and energetic abstraction is an
  excellent example of Norman Lewis''s late 1960s period. Between 1966 and 1969, Norman
  Lewis painted a series of paintings, each with brightly colored grounds and underlying
  figuration typically in black and primary colors. This untitled painting is closely
  related in color and composition to his Masquerade, private collection, from the
  same year, which was included in his 2016-17 retrospective Procession: the Art of
  Norman Lewis. Other known examples from the series are Players, Players Four and
  Playtime; each are from 1966 and reference jazz musicians, a familiar subject of
  Lewis''. This fascinating group of work shows the artist making a decided turn,
  back to more abstract figuration in his painting. These paintings represent an important
  period, coming between his black and white Civil Rights and Klan paintings of the
  early to mid-1960s, and the larger scale paintings and Sea Change series to come
  in the 1970s.'
