  A. Harper painted this beautiful, pastoral landscape on the outskirts of Paris during
  his second French trip. Like fellow landscape painters Edward M. Bannister and James
  Bolivar Needham, Harper was born in Canada; his family moved from Ontario to Illinois
  in 1885. Harper attended the Art Institute of Chicago from 1895 - 1901, working
  as a nightwatch man and janitor to pay for his tuition. Graduating with honors,
  he then studied in Paris from 1903 - 1905 at the Acad√©mie Julian following in Henry
  Ossawa Tanner''s footsteps, and was greatly influenced by the Barbizon School. In
  1905, Harper earned the Municipal Art League''s blue ribbon at the Art Institute
  of Chicago for nine of his paintings. On a return trip to France from 1907-08, Harper
  studied informally with Tanner and his paintings became more Impressionist. Harper''s
  career was cut short when he died of tuberculosis only a few years later at the
  age of 36. The Art Institute held a memorial exhibition in Harper''s honor, showcasing
  60 of his works. Today, his paintings are in the collections of the Metropolitan
  Museum of Art, the National Gallery (The Evans-Tibbs Collection), the National Museum
  of African American History and Culture, Smithsonian Institution, the Columbus Museum
  of Art, the DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center, the Flint Institute
  of Fine Arts, Tuskegee University, the Harmon and Harriet Kelley Foundation for
  the Arts and the Walter O. Evans Collection of African American Art. Barnwell p.
