Published by Whitechapel Gallery, London.<br><br>For the group show Spirit of Utopia at the Whitechapel Gallery, July - September 2013, Theaster Gates created a studio for making pottery, training apprentices, and investigating skill, teaching, and craft. Bitch, I Made this Pot is a wryly emblematic commentary by Gates on the subject of artistic authorship.
