FOOTNOTE: Charlotte Brooks (1918-2014) was a photojournalist best known for her work
  at "Look" magazine where she worked from 1951-1971. Early in her photographic career
  she assisted the artists Barbara Morgan and Gjon Mili in New York City. Her work
  was noticed by Roy Stryker, and she was asked to join his project at Standard Oil
  of New Jersey documenting America at home during World War II. When the project
  ended, Arthur Rothstein introduced her to executives at "Look" where she eventually
  became the only woman on the permanent photography staff until its demise in 1971.
