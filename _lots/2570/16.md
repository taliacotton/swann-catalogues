  Mennie made these images during two trips on the upper Yangtze River in China: the first on a steamer from Ichang to Chungking, during poor weather, and the second between Ichang and Wan Hsien. The book ends at Chungking, “the great metropolis of Western China,” 1400 miles from the sea. The city is seen across the 700 yard stretch of turbulent water where the current was so strong it could take an hour to cross.
