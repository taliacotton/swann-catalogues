FOOTNOTE: "Edwin Hale Lincoln moved to the Berkshire area in 1893, less than 10 years
  after taking up photography. He had previously been a drummer boy during the Civil
  War and a page in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, but now largely made
  his living photographing large yachts and estates, as well as the burgeoning Berkshire
  \"summer cottages.\" \n\nLincoln's spare aesthetic contrasted with the Photo-Secessionist's
  concurrent embrace of Pictorialism, and instead his clean images can be seen within
  the context of the American Arts & Crafts movement (his work was published in Gustav
  Stickley's The Craftsman, where they received warm praise). In many ways a precursor
  to later, \"straight\" landscape photography prominent on the West Coast, Lincoln's
  quiet botanical studies both elevate his subject matter as well as elegantly reveal
  the plants' detailed, quiet complexities. \n\nLincoln began working on this series
  in the early 1890s and finished it in 1914. He printed the photographs and produced
  sets for subscribers."
