TYPESET: "Possibly related to a mining business, the album's stunning imagery includes visits to and imagery related to Native individuals; an image of an Asian man and small child; horseback trips through rugged terrain (featuring enormous cacti); visits to what may be mining towns (including Ray, Arizona, which was known for its copper mine); Salt Lake City; the Spokane train station; massive train bridges and feats of train track engineering; lush Western forests; and city street scenes, all rendered in crisp and compelling detail. The album also appears to show travels to Mexico.
