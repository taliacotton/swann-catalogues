CROSSHEAD: A handsome and immersive album with approximately 100 photographs showing

  visits to and imagery related to Native individuals; an image of an Asian man and
  small child; horseback trips through rugged terrain (featuring enormous cacti);
  visits to what may be mining towns (including Ray, Arizona, which was known for
  its copper mine); Salt Lake City; the Spokane train station; massive train bridges
  and feats of train track engineering; lush Western forests; and city street scenes,
  all rendered in crisp and compelling detail. The album also appears to show travels
  to Mexico. Silver prints, the images measuring 5x7Â¾ inches (12.7x19.7 cm.), and
