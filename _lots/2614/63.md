He wrote of Castorland to Alfred Stieglitz (1864-1946), the photographer and proprietor of the vanguard modern art gallery, 291, on Fifth Avenue, New York, \"It is a great big rolling country, this, and I expect to be up here through September, I'll be rolling with it or continue to roll against.\"<br><br>Finding himself out of the city, Marin was able to return to vibrant, warm colors like those he had used previously during his European sojourn.  Marin's work from this summer featured simplified forms and imaginative palettes, a carefree style free from the frenetic energy of New York."
