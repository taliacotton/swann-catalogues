TYPESET: "Oil on canvas.  535x480 mm; 21x19 inches.  Signed in oil, lower right recto.<br><br>Provenance: Estate of Evelyne Z. Daitz, New York.<br><br>McGlynn (1878-1966) was born in San Francisco and studied at the California School of Design.  He worked as a designer and teacher early on in his career.  Centered in the Bay Area, McGlynn and his family would make frequent trips to the Monterey Peninsula and, in 1934, he was granted membership to the Carmel-by-the-Sea artistâ€™s cooperative.  The president of the cooperative, Armin Hansen (1886-1957) had been in the 1906 class at California School of Design with McGlynn and invited him to join the group of plein air painters in Monterey.  Despite his dedication to teaching, McGlynn and his wife could not resist the offer and soon bought a home in Pebble Beach.  For several years, the family made the trip on weekends and eventually they moved permanently to Monterey.  McGlynn's impressionistic landscape paintings capture the unique light of the Pacific Coast with pure and radiant color."
