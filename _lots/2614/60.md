  (1867-1938), one America''s finest Modernist colorists, was overlooked for the majority
  of his career.  Now however his place alongside Georgia O''Keeffe, John Marin, Marsden
  Hartley and Max Weber--all fellow exhibitors at Alfred Stieglitz''s "291" Gallery
  in New York--is understood and he ranks among the group of most modern and influential
  artists in America during the early 20th century.<br><br>Developing a friendship
  with Stieglitz around 1911, and after a drawn-out litigation to rightfully claim
  his recognition and compensation for designing the Bronx, New York courthouse, Bluemner
  decided to turn completely to painting in 1912 and embarked on a seven month European
  voyage.  Upon his return, after exposure to works by Paul CÃ©zanne, Vincent van Gogh,
  as well as the Fauves and Cubists, Bluemner''s work reflected a dramatic shift toward
  the bright, streamlined style that would define his work and parallel the developments
  made by other American modern artists during the early 20th century.  Like Edward
  Hopper, Bluemner traveled widely along the east coast, in the countryside surrounding
  New York, and made numerous watercolor studies of landscapes and buildings, virtually
  all of which are devoid of human presence.'
