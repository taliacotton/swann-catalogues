TYPESET: "Oil on canvas, circa 1905-07.  405x510 mm; 16x20 inches.  Signed in oil, lower right recto.<br><br>Gregory Gilbert has reviewed and verbally confirmed this work to be by the artist.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection, Virginia.<br><br>During the first decade of the 20th century, Hart (1868-1933) traveled extensively, spending time in Europe, the South Pacific, and Egypt.  While in Paris in 1907 he studied at the Acad√©mie Julian for a brief period, however most of his time abroad was spent observing other cultures and recording his travels in his artwork.  While he received some academic training and observed the emergent modern art movements in Paris, his style remained rooted in American tendencies.  His works from this time are particularly reminiscent of the Ashcan School and their propensity to record a living experience.  This work, one of approximately 28 oil paintings the artist executed during his career, depicts daily life in Holland."
