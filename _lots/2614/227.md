TYPESET: "Pastel, charcoal and gouache on cream wove paper, circa 1950.  390x273 mm; 15¼x10¾ inches.  Signed in charcoal, lower right recto. <br><br>Provenance: Gifted by the artist to Leo Manso, New York; thence by descent to current owner, private collection, New York.  <br><br>Burliuk (1882-1967) and abstract artist Leo Manso (1914-1993) may have first crossed paths in New York in the late 1940s, where they moved in the same artist circles.  They both participated in a group show at the Downtown Community School's December 1947 fundraising exhibition, alongside Milton Avery, Dorr Bothwell, George Constant, Harry Gottlieb, Louise Nevelson, Marguerite and William Zorach, and Moses and Raphael Soyer, among others.  Burliuk had settled on Long Island and Manso in Provincetown, Massachusetts in 1947, though there were crosscurrents between the two communities as artists summered in both locations.  Late in Burliuk's career, from 1951 to 1965, he was represented by the Provincetown Tirca Karlis Gallery, the same firm that represented Manso through the 1960s."
