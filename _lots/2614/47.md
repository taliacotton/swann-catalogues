With a James Bourlet & Sons, London, framemakers label verso.<br><br>Provenance: The New York Trust Company; possibly Thomas Colville, Connecticut, with an inscription on the frame verso; private collection, South Carolina; private collection, Chicago.<br><br>The influence of James A. M. Whistler is evident in Pennell’s (1857-1926) work with its often impressionistic line, but the artist often chose a modern subject.  Born in Pennsylvania, Pennell made London his home and did not return full-time to the United States until World War I.  He traveled twice to New York prior to that, in 1904 and 1908, and captured the changing character of the city with the growing number of skyscrapers, a reflection of his interest in depicting modern life through urban landscapes, factories and industry."
