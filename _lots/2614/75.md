  collection, Massachusetts.<br><br>Whitney (1875-1942) was an American sculptor,
  art patron and collector, and founder in 1931 of the Whitney Museum of American
  Art in New York.  She was a prominent social figure and hostess, who was born into
  the wealthy Vanderbilt family and married into the Whitney family.  While visiting
  Europe in the early 1900s, Whitney discovered the burgeoning art world of Montmartre
  and Montparnasse in France, which encouraged her to pursue her creativity and become
  a sculptor.<br><br>She studied at the Art Students League of New York with Hendrik
  Christian Andersen and James Earle Fraser.  Other women students in her classes
  included Anna Vaughn Hyatt and Malvina Hoffman.  In Paris she studied with Andrew
  O''Connor and also received criticism from Auguste Rodin.  Her training with sculptors
  of public monuments influenced her later direction.  Although her catalogs include
  numerous smaller sculptures, like the current work, she is best known today for
  her monumental works.'
