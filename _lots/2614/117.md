DESCRIPT: ALFRED H. MAURER
CROSSHEAD: Girl in a Green Coat.
TYPESET: 'Tempera on linen mounted on board, circa 1921.  Signed in tempera, upper
  left recto, and signed in crayon, verso.  <br><br>Provenance: Estate of Arthur B.
  Davies, New York, 1928-30, with stamp twice on the frame back; private collection,
  New York.<br><br>According to Judith Zilczer, in her article "Arthur B. Davies:
  The Artist as Patron," appearing in The American Art Journal, Summer 1987, Davies
  (1862-1928) had first purchased a sketch by Maurer (1868-1932) in April 1909 from
  Alfred Stieglitz''s 291 in New York.  Davies continued to support artists in Stieglitz''s
  circle, including Marsden Hartley (1877-1943).<br><br>The current work is an example
  of Maurer''s technique of painting on his "made" canvases.  Seeking to emulate the
  Old Masters, Maurer began to experiment with materials in the early 1900s.  To create
  the "made" canvas, Maurer stretched linen (or other fabric scrap) over a wood frame
  and cardboard, coated it with glue and set it with dental plaster.  Elizabeth McCausland
  opined that Maurer intended these works to appear filmy, dingey, and spotted with
  "freckles" under the layer of gesso, only eliciting more outcries from his conservative
  detractors.  Maurer adopted his "made" canvas technique in his Paris years and continued
  the practice after returning to America in 1914.<br><br> Maurer''s first paintings
  in his so-called "Girl" series debuted in 1921 at the Salon of Independent Artists,
  New York.  These long-necked women are often mistakenly attributed to the influence
  of Amedeo Modigliani.  Given that the reference frames of the artists'' careers
  do not match up, McCausland wrote that instead, Maurer was more likely inspired
  by Botticelli''s Venuses with elongated necks.  Since Modigliani''s works did not
  reach the  United States until 1920, McCausland wrote empathetically, "Let Maurer
  have the last word in the controversy.  ''Who is this man Modigliani?'' he is often
  quoted as asking."'
