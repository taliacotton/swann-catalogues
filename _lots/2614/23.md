Zabriskie.<br><br>Mason's Island is an inhabited island at the mouth of the Mystic River, in Stonington, Connecticut.  The island was named after Major John Mason who was granted the island in recognition for his military services in the 1637 Pequot War in nearby Mystic.  This island remained in the Mason family for over 250 years, from 1651 to 1913.  Since then, the Allyn family have been stewards of it, and most of the island is owned by the Mason's Island Company and regulated by property deeds under the Mason's Island Property Owners Association. The Mason's Island Marina and the Mystic River Marina are located on the north end of the island.  Mason's Island is now connected to the mainland by a causeway."
