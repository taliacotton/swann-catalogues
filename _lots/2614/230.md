TYPESET: 'Bronze, 1959.  215 mm; 8½ inches (height).  Incised with the artist''s signature
  and date, and the Roman Bronze Works, New York, foundry mark on the underside of
  the base.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection, Chicago.<br><br>Perhaps more than
  any other American artist returning from Paris in the first decade of the 20th century,
  Weber (1881-1961), an avid student of art history who possessed a critical eye for
  the avant-garde, skillfully incorporated the new directions of French modern art
  into his work.  Weber absorbed the primitivism of his good friend, the self-taught
  artist Henri Rousseau, the early Cubism of Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso and
  the Fauvism of Henri Matisse and Émile Othon Frieze.<br><br>Born in Poland and emigrating
  to Brooklyn at the age of ten, Weber studied at the Pratt Institute under pioneering
  modernist teacher, Arthur Wesley Dow, who was also an important influence on Weber
  as an accomplished printmaker and painter himself.  In the early 1920s, Weber traveled
  to Paris just in time to view a major Paul Cézanne retrospective, as well as visit
  Gertrude Stein’s artistic salon and take classes at Matisse’s private academy.  Weber
  worked in singular modern style throughout most of his career and influenced many
  following generations of American artists.'
