Inscribed with the artist's encircled initials and stamped 3/6 on the edge of the base.  <br><br>Provenance:  Purchased from The Zorach Collection, May 1979; thence by descent to current owner, private collection, New York.<br><br>Born in 1887 in Lithuania, William Zorach immigrated to Cleveland, with his family at age 4. He worked as both a sculptor and watercolorist at the vanguard of American modernism, after briefly studying in Paris in the early 1910s.  While Zorach initially practiced painting, his interests in sculpture, which took root in 1917, soon eclipsed all other media.  By the 1930s, Zorach was regarded as one of America’s premier sculptors and was honored with multiple commissions and exhibitions including shows at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and the Art Institute of Chicago."
