TYPESET: "Oil on board, 1867.  212x150 mm; 8⅜x5⅞ inches.  Signed and dated in oil, lower left recto.  <br><br>Provenance: Private collection, New York; thence by descent to current owner, Florida.<br><br>The present work is a small version of a larger 1866-67 oil on canvas, now in a private collection.  Brown (1831-1913), the British-born American painter renowned for his genre scenes, customarily painted small paintings with similar themes and titles, not as studies for a larger work but as separate works to meet popular demand.  His paintings of both childhood  mischievousness and innocence were highly sought after by collectors.  The model in the current work also appears in Children of the Forest, an 1866 oil on canvas sold at Sotheby's, New York, March 28, 2018, lot 134.<br><br>We wish to thank Martha Hoppin for her assistance researching this lot."
