Signed, titled and dated in oil, verso.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection, Chicago.<br><br>Hultberg (1922-2005) was born in Berkeley, California and studied at Fresno State College, graduating in 1943, before serving in the Navy during World War II.  After the war, he studied at the California School of Fine Arts under Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still.  He gained success early in his career in the 1950s and won first prize at the Corcoran Biennial in Washington, D.C., in 1955. Though initially he was associated with the Bay Area Figurative Movement, he also worked in the Abstract Expressionist style as well as Surrealism and Realism.  In 1971, he moved to Monhegan Island, Maine and much of his work from that period reflects his time there.  His work is included in the permanent collections of major museums such as the Guggenheim Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York."
