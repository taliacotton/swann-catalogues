TYPESET: "Oil on paper, 1953.  237x529 mm; 9½x21 inches.  Signed and dated in ink, upper left recto.<br><br>Provenance: Possibly Paul Kantor Gallery, Los Angeles, or Esther-Robles Gallery, Los Angeles, with a partial label; private collection, Chicago.<br><br>Levee (1924-2017) received a master's degree in philosophy from UCLA and subsequently became an aviator in World War II. After the war he decided to stay to work as a painter in Montparnasse, Paris.  He later studied art at the Art Center School, Los Angeles and at Académie Julian, Paris from 1949 to 1951.<br><br>His early painting, like the current work, was inspired by the New York School of abstract expressionism, which included Franz Kline (1910-1962), Robert Motherwell (1915-1991), Jackson Pollock (1912-1956), Mark Rothko (1903-1970), Ad Reinhardt (1913-1967), Willem de Kooning (1904-1997) and Philip Guston (1913-1980), among others.  After a period of hard-edge painting based on geometric abstraction through the 1960s, Levee returned to his more spontaneous abstract expressionist style, often using collage elements with loose brush work typical of lyrical abstraction."
