TYPESET: "Pencil, color crayons and watercolor on paper.  360x282 mm; 14⅛x11¼ inches.  Signed in pencil, lower right recto.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection, New Jersey.<br><br>Rebay (1890-1967) was born into an aristocratic family in Strasbourg (at the time a part of Germany) and studied painting in Paris, Cologne and Munich.  In 1917, she moved to Berlin and was introduced to the avant-garde Galerie der Sturm, which was the center of the modern art scene in the city. While in Berlin, she also met Rudolf Bauer (1889-1953), with whom she had a lifelong relationship.<br><br>Rebay was interested in non-objective art, a form of abstraction that was rooted in esoteric religious beliefs and philosophical ideas of intuition. She believed this form of art was a cure for a world ravaged by war and the burgeoning technological innovations that fueled materialism.<br><br>In 1927, she moved to New York and was commissioned to paint Solomon Guggenheim's portrait. She took the opportunity to encourage him to collect non-objective art and became instrumental in guiding Guggenheim's collection. When he founded the Museum of Non-Objective Painting (now the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) in New York, she was the first curator and director of the museum and chose Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959) to design the now iconic building."
