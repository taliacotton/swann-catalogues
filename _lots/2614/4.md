Zabriskie.<br><br>Wyant (1836-1892) was an American landscape painter.  His early works belonged to the Hudson River School, with its direct pastoral narrative, but evolved into the moodier and more shadowy Tonalism.  After a stroke which paralyzed his right arm, he taught himself to paint with his left.  Born in Ohio, Wyant worked primarily in New York following his training, as well as several years in Cincinnati and Europe.  After his marriage in 1880, he began to spend most of his time in Keene Valley, New York.  He moved in 1889 to Arkville, New York (in the Catskills).  He frequently painted in the Adirondacks, which is likely represented in this view, as well as in the Catskills.  Wyant was only moderately appreciated during his lifetime, though after his death his works were eagerly sought for and are now in museums including the National Museum of American Art, Washington, D.C., the Brooklyn Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the Toledo Museum of Art, the Tennessee State Museum, Nashville and the Dayton Art Institute."
