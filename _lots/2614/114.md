TYPESET: "Silverpoint and color pencils on paper.  360x240 mm; 14⅛x9½ inches.  Signed in pencil, lower right recto. <br><br>Provenance: Private collection, South Carolina.<br><br>The technique of silverpoint drawing linked Stella (1877-1946) to the Old Masters and allowed him to attain thin, light capturing lines.  The medium was rarely used, as it requires precise handling (it cannot be erased) and an abrasive ground. Stella used zinc white gouache to prepare his paper which also gave the illusion that his subjects floated in space."
