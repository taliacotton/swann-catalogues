  September 15-November 30, 2006.<br><br>Demuth (1883-1935) was born in Lancaster,
  Pennsylvania and suffered an injury as a child that forced him to walk with a cane.  As
  he was unable to be as physically active as other children, his mother gave him
  crayons to draw with.  His parents supported his art from a young age and he attended
  Franklin and Marshall College, Drexel University and the Pennsylvania Academy of
  Fine Arts, Philadelphia.  After leaving school, he focused on his preferred medium
  of watercolor and found inspiration in flowers and plants in his mother''s garden,
  a subject that would preoccupy him throughout his life.<br><br>Demuth made his studio
  at his home in Lancaster, but traveled frequently and made many important friends
  in the artistic community.  He traveled three times to Paris where he studied at
  the Académie Colarossi and Académie Julian, joined the avant-garde artistic scene,
  and admired the work of European modernists, even spending time at Gertrude Stein''s
  salon.  He met Marsden Hartley while in Paris who later introduced him to Alfred
  Stieglitz and became part of his tightknit group of artists.<br><br>Demuth spent
  several summers at the artists'' colony at Provincetown, Massachusetts, during the
  mid-1910s and, in 1914, exhibited his watercolors in the Provincetown studio of
  modernist painter, E. Ambrose Webster.'
