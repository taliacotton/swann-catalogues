  Estate of Virginia M. Zabriskie.<br><br>Walkowitz (1878-1965) was born in Tyumen,
  Siberia to Jewish parents and immigrated to the Lower East Side of New York with
  his mother in 1889. He was trained in the academic style at the National Academy
  of Design, New York, and also at the Académie Julian in Paris, though his style
  was most influenced by his experiences outside of the studio.  In Paris, Walkowitz
  was also impressed by the landmark 1907 Paul Cézanne (1839-1906) retrospective exhibit
  at the Salon d''Automne and by his introduction to the work of Henri Matisse (1869-1954)
  and Henri Rousseau (1844-1910). By the time Walkowitz returned to New York, his
  style was heavily influenced by European Modernism, with emphasis on gestures, simplified
  forms and flat planes of bold color. His first solo exhibition was held at Haas
  Gallery, the back of a modest frame shop, in New York in 1908.<br><br>In 1912, Walkowitz
  met Albert Stieglitz (1864-1946) through Marsden Hartley (1877-1943) and became
  involved with 291, Stieglitz''s New York gallery, which served as a hub of American
  modernism. Stieglitz was so impressed by the young artist, that he sent him to study
  art in Greece, Italy and North Africa in 1914. His style became more abstract; its
  reduced linear forms lent themselves to the city''s rush skyward, prematurely anticipating
  the New York School and the Abstract Expressionists.<br><br>In 1913, Walkowitz was
  represented at the Armory Show and in the 1916 Forum exhibition. Walkowitz was concerned
  with politics and artists'' rights and was active in various artist''s groups, founding
  the People''s Art Guild and the Society of Independent Artists (he became director
  of the latter from 1918 to 1938). In 1920, he exhibited at the Société Anonyme alongside
  Hartley and Joseph Stella (1877-1946). Despite local and international recognition,
  Walkowitz was not nearly as well-known as his contemporaries. Walkowitz painted
  into the 1940s, when his eyesight began to fail.'
