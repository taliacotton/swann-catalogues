  William Vareika Fine Arts, Ltd., Newport, Rhode Island, August 28-November 30, 2009.<br><br>Published:
  Yarnall, "New Insights on John La Farge and Photography," The American Art Journal,
  volume XIX, number 2, 1987, page 73 (illustrated).<br><br>Many of the works in the
  Moore''s Art Gallery, New York, auction in 1885 were replicas of pictures that La
  Farge had sold the previous year in his forced sale at the auctioneers Ortgies &
  Co., New York.  The artist considered making copies both a substitute for keeping
  works that he did not really want to sell and as a potential future source of income.  The
  current work is based on a watercolor sold in 1884 at Ortgies & Co. (W. 1880.14)
  that dates from 1880 according to the auction catalogue.  Both are based on drawings
  executed around 1865 as La Farge worked on illustrations for Henry Wadsworth Longfellow''s
  The Skeleton in Armor, a ballad set in Newport, Rhode Island.  The backdrop represents
  Brenton''s Cove, Newport, prominently featured in the poem.  La Farge''s other drawings
  of the subject are now in the Bowdoin College Museum of Art, Brunswick, Maine, and
  the Addison Gallery of American Art, Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts.'
