Known for creating colorful works in a carefree, lighthearted manner and her strong personality, she thrived in the New York art scene of the 1940s. Toward the end of the decade, she decided to leave the city, which resulted in a period of seclusion.  After contracting polio in 1959, Blaine was told she would never paint again, but she managed to continue her creative output by drawing and painting with watercolors."
