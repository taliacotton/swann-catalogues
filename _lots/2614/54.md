  by Mary Ran Gallery, Cincinnati.<br><br>In November of 1910, in an effort to transform
  the image of the Santa Fe Railway and to stimulate tourism to the American Southwest,
  Cincinnati-born Potthast (1857-1927), along with four other prominent American artists
  (Thomas Moran, Elliott Daingerfield, Frederick B. Williams, De Witt Parshall), was
  invited by the Railway to journey to the Grand Canyon to recreate on canvas the
  unique experience of its landscape.  This was Potthast''s first visit to the Grand
  Canyon and of significant importance for the artist.  Potthast would go on to exhibit
  his depictions of the Grand Canyon at the National Academy of Design in New York
  in 1911, 1918 and 1920.  Potthast''s devotion to the Southwest would also lead him
  to become a founder of a group called the Society of Men Who Paint the Far West,
  which included several of the artists who accompanied Potthast on the 1910 painting
  excursion.'
