After her return to Chicago, Pryor studied architectural design with Louis J. Millet and specialized in stained glass.  Later, her career expanded to include jewelry and textile design.  She exhibited her paintings through the 1930s and 1940s, at the Art Institute of Chicago and Findlay Galleries, Chicago.
