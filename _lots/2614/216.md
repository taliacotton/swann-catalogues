  New York; thence by descent to the current owner, private collection, New Mexico.
  <br><br>Matthiasdottir (1917-2000) was born in Reykjavik, Iceland and studied in
  Copenhagen and Paris before moving to New York in 1942.  She likely met Nell Blaine
  while studying with Hans Hoffman alongside Larry Rivers, Robert De Niro, Sr. and
  Jane Freilicher. Jane Street Gallery hosted her first solo exhibition in 1948. During
  the 1960s she honed her characteristic manner of rendering landscapes, figures and
  interior scenes with broad bands of color and brushstrokes, paring the forms down
  to their elemental shapes. Her works are found in the collections of Reykjavík Municipal
  Art Museum, Kjarvalstaðir, Iceland, the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden,
  Smithsonian Institute, Washington, D.C., The National Museum of Women in the Arts,
  Washington, D.C. and the Portland Museum of Art, Maine.</p>"
