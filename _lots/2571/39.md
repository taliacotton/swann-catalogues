FOOTNOTE: "Rare color-printed kawaraban depicting Russian Admiral Yevfimiy Vasilyevich Putyatin's squadron entering Osaka Bay in late 1854. <br><br>In the wake of American Commodore Matthew Perry's successful opening of Japan in 1853, Putyatin sailed into Osaka attempting to gain an audience with Shogunate officials. After a brief stay, Putyatin found himself ushered from Osaka and was requested to continue to Shimoda where a meeting of diplomatic negotiations would be arranged. As the fleet sat anchored at Shimoda on December 23, 1854, a tremendous earthquake struck the area causing a tsunami which destroyed the fleet and damaged the flagship Diana's hull beyond repair. With a collaborative effort between the Russians and local Japanese carpenters a schooner was built in a matter of months that was large enough to carry Putyatin and his crew back to their homeland. This was the first western-style ship built in Japan and an early instance of Japanese learning western technology, models of which were quickly incorporated into their own naval fleets. <br><br>Before departing, Putyatin and Japanese officials negotiated the Treaty of Shimoda, ending Japan's centuries-long policy of international isolationism. The treaty opened Japan's ports to Russian commerce and defined the northern territorial borders between the two Empires. "
