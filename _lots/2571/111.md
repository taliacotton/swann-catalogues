FOOTNOTE: "Separately published first issue of a map which was subsequently re-engraved to be included in Melish's 1813 \"Military and Topographical Atlas of the United States\". <br><br><br><br>As Melish writes on page 3 of that work: \"The first map in the list is The Seat of War in North America. Previous to the declaration of war, the author had travelled extensively in the north and west parts of the United States, collecting authentic information regarding the present state of the country, and had moved to Philadelphia to put his travels to press. Knowing how unsatisfactory topographical and statistical information is without good maps, particular attention was paid to select the best and most authentic maps in the country, from which to construct those for the travels. While engaged in drawing them, a much valued friend [Henry Schenck Tanner] suggested the propriety of drawing a general map of the seat of war, and proffered the use of a very ample set of excellent maps in his possession. Of these, the author gladly availed himself; the map was produced, and immediately received the stamp of public approbation. It sold so rapidly, that the first plate was soon worn out, and a new one has since been brought forward, enlarged and much improved.\"<br><br><br><br>The present map is slightly smaller and significant differences of engraving can be seen when compared to that of the version found in the \"Atlas\". This edition not in Phillips. "
