FOOTNOTE: 'Two outstanding visual charts compiled by Roy Wenzlick, a prominent 20th-century
  real estate economist group. <br><br>"A Century of Real Estate Trends" - the central
  map illustrates Percentage Change in the Number of Dwelling Units by Counties: 1940
  to 1950; the panels at top and bottom chart Real Estate Activity and Business Activity
  from 1850 to 1950; a series of graphs at left center shows the Construction Cost
  of Six Standard Buildings (California bungalow, five-room brick house, six-room
  frame house, six-room brick house, 18-family brick apartment building, and a 30-unit
  concrete apartment building); at right center are shown Factors Affecting Real Estate
  Sales and Values from 1900 to 1950 (such as building material costs, mortgage activity,
  residential interest rates, etc.); Corporate Earnings, Dividends and Taxes from
  1940 to 1950; Trend in Farm Values from 1910 to 1950; and Shrinkage in the Purchasing
  Power of the Dollar from 1939 to 1950 (represented by stacks of pennies and value
  decreased by almost half in the short timeframe). <br><br>"Basic Barometers of Real
  Estate Trends" - main map presents Percentage of Change in Total Population by Counties:
  1940 to 1950; the upper panel delineates Real Estate and Business Activity from
  1850 to 1950; below that is Shrinkage in the Purchasing Power of the Dollar from
  1900 to 1950 (with an even more depressing decrease than the earlier pattern); at
  left are seen Construction Costs Continue to Climb; Factors Affecting New Building;
  Taxes, Savings and Expenditures; Farm Value, Taxes and Income; at lower right are
  six graphs showing Regional Patterns of Real Estate Activity from 1890 to 1950 (New
  England, East Central, West Central, South, South, Southwest and West Coast) with
  notations pointing out the model of an 18-year cycle of booms and depressions to
  the market. <br><br>OCLC locates no more than three examples of each sheet, with
  the Milwaukee County Public Library listed as the only institution owning both.'
