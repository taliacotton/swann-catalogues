FOOTNOTE: 'Russian Admiral Yevfimiy Vasilyevich Putyatin played an instrumental role
  in negotiating commercial relations between Japan and Russia. The Treaty of Shimoda,
  signed in 1855 between the two empires, opened Japan''s ports to Russian commerce.
  <br><br>In late 1854 Putyatin arrived with his squadron at Osaka Bay causing a great
  panic among the Shogunate, as related in this contemporary document. The Russians
  were shortly thereafter directed on to Shimoda for a more comfortable setting to
  hold diplomatic negotiations. On December 23, 1854, the day prior to a planned meeting
  with Shogunate officials, a massive earthquake hit the area causing a great tsunami
  which destroyed the Russian ships. Local Japanese tradesmen worked together with
  the Russians to build a new boat large enough to sail Putyatin and his crew back
  to their homeland. This was the first western-style ship built in Japan and an early
  instance of Japanese learning western technology. The vessel, dubbed "Heda", was
  completed in a matter of months and after finalizing the trade treaty in spring
  1855, the Russians dispatched for home. <br><br>together with: Woodblock report
  of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between Japan and Russia. 44 pages, 8vo format,
  9x6Â¼ inches, plain wrappers; small amount of worm track. [1858]. '
