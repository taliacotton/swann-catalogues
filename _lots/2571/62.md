DESCRIPT: "(NEW ORLEANS.) Benjamin Moore Norman."
CROSSHEAD: Norman’s Plan of New Orleans & Environs.
at-a-glance: 'New Orleans: B.M. Norman, 1845'
TYPESET: Hand-colored engraved pocket map of New Orleans with concentric distance
  circles at ¼-mile intervals and a 71-point keyed reference legend below. 18x24½
  inches overall, folding into publisher's 12mo format gilt-and-blind-stamped red
  roan case; modest strengthening to a few fold versos but on the whole exceptionally
  well preserved; publisher's printed shop ticket pasted to inside cover.
FOOTNOTE: 'A beautiful copy of an apparently unrecorded pocket map. <br><br>In 1845
  Benjamin Norman published his guidebook to New Orleans which included a very similar
  engraved plan of the city with credit given to Henry Mollhausen for the survey.
  That "first" edition is itself quite scarce however, no standard references we''ve
  consulted cite the variant pocket version seen here.<br><br>In the present plate
  quite a few engraved differences can be found when compared to the 1845 guide version:
  a different script is used at the title; Mollhausen''s name does not appear; our
  reference key notes 71 locations versus 80; a larger explanation and scale table
  is here; riverfront treatment differs; and frankly on closer inspection one realizes
  this is an altogether different plan covering less area and with less toponym detail,
  features which lead us to surmise it was separately published and pre-dates the
  "first" guidebook edition. <br><br>Jumonville, Bibliography of New Orleans Imprints
  1412; Charting Louisiana 180 - (both citing the 1845 guidebook edition).'
