pullquote: 'A Fine Early Seventeenth-Century Italian Celestial Globe '
DESCRIPT: "(GLOBES.) Giuseppe de Rossi; after Jodocus Hondius."
CROSSHEAD: 'Globus Coelest, in quo stellae fixæ omnes quæ a N. Viro Tychone Brahe
  suma cura observatæ sunt, accuratissime dessignantur: quibus adjuncte sunt circa
  Pol. Aust. stel: quæ a pertiss: nauclero Petro Theodori annotate sunt simul accomodate
  ad ann. 1614; æditus vero ann. 1615. '
at-a-glance: "[Milan or Rome], 1615"
TYPESET: "<p>8-inch celestial globe comprised of 12 hand-colored engraved gores, laid
  horizontally on steel axis pins within a modified turned mahogany stand; globe with
  only minor unobtrusive wear, green wash applied at original construction aged to
  an attractive patina, small previous owner's mark to the right of Sagittarius, base
  with repairs.</p>"
FOOTNOTE: The present astral sphere faithfully replicates a slightly earlier globe
  created by Jodocus Hondius in Amsterdam, 1601; our maker, de Rossi, excludes any
  acknowledgement to that original source. Whether Rossi used the original Hondius
  plates versus new gores engraved in Italy, the pert imagery of each emblematic constellation
  is crisp and dramatic - a delightful way to visualize the celestial skies; the unusual
  flat format makes for a pleasing overhead tabletop viewing experience.<br><br>Edward
