DESCRIPT: "(JAPAN -- WORLD WAR II.) Japanese Ministry of the Navy."
CROSSHEAD: Wagakuni Yushu Tsunyu Jokyo.
at-a-glance: Japan, Showa 3 (1928)
TYPESET: Enormous offset color-printed data visualization map of the world on 4 sheets
  joined. 58Â½x81 inches overall; folded, generally excellent with only minor scattered
  foxing.
FOOTNOTE: Oversized chart referencing trade goods, raw materials, and other economic
  resources around the world, but with particular concentration on the naval strengths
  of Great Britain (vertical bar graph at left), Japan (center), and the United States
  (right); a focused intelligence chart by the Japanese Naval Department demonstrating
  the Empire's vulnerability as compared to other world powers. The Washington Naval
  Treaty of 1922 limited the Allied nations of World War I from naval construction
  in the hopes of avoiding an international arms race; The London Naval Treaty of
  1930 (two years after this map was published) sought to further increase regulations.
  Within several years Japan had officially renounced these sanctions with an eye
  towards major naval expansion, a clear concern and goal illustrated by this map,
  and an obvious indication that conflict was brewing.
