CROSSHEAD: "GENERAL ATOMIC / TRIGA. 1958."
at-a-glance: "50¼x35¼ inches, 127½x89½ cm. R. Marsens, Lausanne."
TYPESET: "Nitsche followed the success of his first series with <i>Exploring the Universe</i> in 1958, which, like its predecessor, offers a modern, poetic and friendly approach to progress, but in more earthy and calm colors. This poster, however, seems to stand alone as the one image Nitsche designed for General Atomic, which was founded as a subsidiary of General Dynamics in 1955. \"Triga [is] a nuclear reactor whose unique uranium zirconium hydride fuel elements provide a self-regulating power level and, as a result, a guarantee that the reactor will not run wild as the consequence of some operating mishap\" (Dynamic America p. 374). In layman's terms, it was a meltdown-free reactor. It went into operation on May 3, 1958. Modern American 85, MoMA 515.1983."
FOOTNOTE: "Condition A- / A: minor creases and abrasions at edges; tape on verso at edges. Paper."
