TYPESET: "Late in 1922, Schwitters and van Doesburg planned a small tour around the Netherlands with a traveling Dada show in order to introduce local artists to their work. The initial evening had been scheduled for December 27, but Schwitters had problems with his passport and the first show was delayed until January 10. In all, there were 17 separate performances in 8 different locations. The first event was held at the Haagsche Kunstkring in The Hague. The address of the venue is included in the poster's upper right corner (\"Haagsche K.K. Binnenhof 8\"). For subsequent performances in other locations, the poster was slightly changed; this address was removed and a small plug for van Doesburg's Dada magazine, <i>Mécano</i>, was added that read, \"Abonnement Mécano F5 per Jaar.\" Otherwise, the two versions of the poster are identical. The poster has the event program and Dada slogans presented in sophisticated disorder, using different hand drawn typography and varying font sizes. \"The poster's discordant appearance reflects the tenor of many Dada evenings\" (moma.org/learn). Modern Poster p. 102 (var), Avant Garde p. 38, Berman p. 38, MoMA 178.1945 (var)."
