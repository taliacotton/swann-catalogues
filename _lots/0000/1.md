  href="https://google.com" title="link title">Commission</a>&lt;/a&gt; (American
  Revolution). Partly-printed Document Signed, as President of the Continental Congress,
  granting to John Ord, commander of the schooner Security, "Licence and Authority
  . . . to attack, seize, and take the Ships and other Vessels belonging to the Inhabitants
  of Great-Britain . . . to some convenient Ports in the . . . Colonies . . . ." Philadelphia,
  6 February 1777 </code></pre>
FOOTNOTE: 'At the start of the Revolution, the military might of the British Navy
  was unmatched, numbering at over 200 vessels, while the Continental Navy began with
  fewer than 30. To win victory at sea, the fledgling government commissioned over
  1,500 privateer vessels over the course of the War. A "letter of marque" issued
  by the Continental Congress, such as the one in this lot, offered a private ship
  owner the opportunity to simultaneously fulfill her duty to the new nation and exercise
  her enterprising spirit (since her crew often divided the spoils of seized enemy
  vessels). The life of a privateer, however, was dangerous: thousands were captured
  and neglected in prison ships anchored near the shores of New York City. Over 10,000
  privateers and other American patriots who died of starvation or disease aboard
  these ships were hastily buried on the shore of the present day Brooklyn Navy Yard.
  Today, these remains are located in a vault below the Prison Ship Martyrs Monument
  in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn.'
at-a-glance: 8x13 inches; encapsulated (but removable), few separations at folds repaired
