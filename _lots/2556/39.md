There, he meets The Missing Person and The Unknown Soldier, who lead him through a landscape inhabited by dinosaurs, lost pets, and misplaced keys, umbrellas, socks, and mittens.Pène du Bois' whimsical illustrations and beloved cast of characters made serious themes accessible and engaging for children. The American author and illustrator is among a select few who have been presented with both a Newbery Medal (for The Twenty-One Balloons, 1947) and Caldecott Honors (for Bear Party, 1951 and Lion, 1956).
