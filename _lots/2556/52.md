TYPESET: "LUDWIG BEMELMANS (1898-1962)\nCouple in Lamp Light. Watercolor on paper. 178x247 mm; 7x9¾ inches, on 8¼x10¼-inch sheet. Signed \"Ludwig Bemelmans\" and dated [19]33 in lower right image. Inscribed \"To Frank + Helen\" in graphite along lower center edge. Taped to window matte.A sweet and fairly early illustration by Bemelmans. The dog is quite similar to his pet dachshund, Waldl, and the man at the table resembles his famous cartoon strip character of the 1920s, Count Bric-a-Brac. The setting reflects his Austrian heritage, also typical of his work of that period."
