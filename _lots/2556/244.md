TYPESET: "JOSEPH CHRISTIAN LEYENDECKER (1874-1951)\nGolfer Lighting a Cigarette. Probable study for cigarette advertisement, possibly unpublished, circa 1920. Oil on canvas with graphite gridlines mounted to later board. 500x512 mm; 19½x20¾ inches. Unsigned; not dated. Framed. Provenance: Illustration House, November 4, 1995, lot 11, with their label on verso; thence to Dick McDonough.Leyendecker brought men's fashion into the spotlight through his famous advertisements for Arrow Collar, Kuppenheimer clothing, and in the dashing figures that graced the over 400 magazine covers he created during the first half of the 20th century. Clothing for sport was no exception and handsome, well-dressed men and women enjoying the game or posing with its paraphernalia were a major theme in his work. In this detailed study, a good example of his working style, we see the cool, laid-back player stopping to light a cigarette with inset studies of his clothing and hand positioning as he strikes the match. The vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines that Leyendecker employed to help him with his composition and proportionality can be traced back to his formal art training and are often found in such studies."
