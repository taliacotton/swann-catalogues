Yeager, the famous glamour photographer, and her close friend and creative partner, the commercial artist Tony Floreani, collaborated on this well-received book showing step-by-step instructions on how to draw the female figure. Yeager herself serves as the model for several of the designs, as does glamour girl Maria Stinger, and Yeager's best-known subject, Bettie Page (pictured in two of the larger scale drawings). The images show women in various poses, both clothed and nude, details of facial features, portraits, and several smaller, rough-cut diagrammatic sketches on tracing paper or onion skin. While Yeager and Floreani conceived and designed the full publication, the drawings are all by Floreani."
