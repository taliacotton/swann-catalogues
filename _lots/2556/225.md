TYPESET: "ANTON OTTO FISCHER (1882-1962)\nGolf outing. Oil on canvas, 1948. 381x508 mm; 15x20 inches, framed to 20¼x25¼ inches. Signed \"Anton Otto Fischer\" and dated \"[19]48\" lower right.Provenance: Private collection; Shannon's Fine Art, October 26, 2017, lot 25; thence to Dick McDonough.Very likely a scene from the hills of the Woodstock Country Club, located in New York's Hudson Valley. Fischer, the celebrated illustrator of books and magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post, Moby-Dick and Treasure Island, was also a passionate golfer and original member of the country club (later renamed the Woodstock Golf Club), founded in 1929. The area was home to notable artists' guilds and colonies since the 19th century, so it is not surprising that several of his fellow charter members were artists as well. Among them were landscape painter John F. Carlson, who was a founder of the Woodstock Artists Association, the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Rube Goldberg, and painter Charles Rosen."
