CROSSHEAD: THE ARCHITECT & THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS / 11TH EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN
  DESIGN. 1928.
TYPESET: <p>This exhibition, which originally ran from February 12 to March 24, 1929,
  was so successful that it stayed up through September. Although not stated in as
  many words, the exhibition was a showcase of American Art Deco interior design and
  architecture. Considered to be the American response to the 1925 Art Deco Exhibition
  in Paris, the interiors were designed by Joseph Urban, Ely Jacques Kahn, Ralph T.
  Walker, Eugene Schoen, John Wellborn Root, Eliel Saarinen, Raymond Hood and Armistead
  Fitzhugh.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Writing in the March 9, 1919 issue of<em> The
  New Yorker Magazine</em>, the architect critic George S. Chappell wrote, “The show
  … should not be missed. From the poster [Dwiggins’] on the outside to the entrance
  of the exhibition gallery inside one is guided by colorful signposts … ”</p><p class="MsoNormal">“W.A.
  Dwiggins was responsible for the graphics for <em>The Architect and the Industrial
  Arts</em> exhibition. He designed the poster, the exhibition labels, and contributed
  a cover design and ornaments to the catalogue. His work was thoroughly in keeping
  with the Art Deco aesthetics of the designs created by the Cooperating Committee
  members” (<a href="https://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2018/03/the-definitive-dwiggins-no-30-the-architect-and-the-industrial-arts/"
  title="">Paul Shaw Letter Design</a>).</p><p class="MsoNormal">“The poster for <em>The
  Architect and the Industrial Arts</em> was designed in late 1928. It is set in Futura
  Medium, which had reached the American market earlier that year. The typography,
  with the text letterspaced, justified (except for the top line which is centered)
  and placed within rules, is typical of Art Deco in its emphasis on symmetry. Dwiggins’
  “concrete-mixer” abstract stencil ornaments — actually one design and a variant
  — in blue, orange and olive complete the <em>moderne</em> look. Dwiggins rarely
  designed posters and the few of them that he did, including this one for <em>The
  Architect and the Industrial Arts</em>, are all relatively small. It is unclear
  if the poster was distributed in the city or if it was only used internally at the
  museum.” (ibid)</p><p class="MsoNormal">Though not widely known by name, Dwiggins
  literally coined the term "Graphic Design" in 1922 to describe his process of book
  design as a melding of typesetting, illustration and design. A creative virtuoso,
  Dwiggins worked on projects ranging from typography, painting, puppetry and furniture
  to kite design, but was most prominent in the publishing and print world. Known
  in close circles as "WAD," he established the style of publisher Alfred A. Knopf's
  books, and developed at least a dozen typefaces including Caledonia and Electra.
  Dwiggins created the original logotype for General Motors, and worked for publications
  such as <em>Life</em> and <em>Harper's</em>. He also served as director of the Harvard
  University Press, and founded the Society of Calligraphers in Boston. This is one
  of the very few posters he designed. <em>Rare</em>. The Met 1928.2.</p>
