TYPESET: "Though not widely known by name, Dwiggins literally coined the term \"Graphic Design\" in 1922 to describe his process of book design as a melding of typesetting, illustration and design. A creative virtuoso, Dwiggins worked on projects ranging from typography, painting, puppetry and furniture to kite design, but was most prominent in the publishing and print world. Known in close circles as \"WAD,\" he established the style of publisher Alfred A. Knopf's books, and developed at least a dozen typefaces including Caledonia and Electra. Dwiggins created the original logotype for General Motors, and worked for publications such as <i>Life</i> and <i>Harper's</i>. He also served as director of the Harvard University Press, and founded the Society of Calligraphers in Boston.
