TYPESET: "To promote the opening of the American room in the Musée de l'Homme (the Parisian Ethnological Museum), Falck uses an adept and striking graphic tactic. Utilizing a modern approach to highlight an ancient art form, he employs a photograph (taken by H.P. Herdeg) of a Central American clay sculpture, against a background of Native American frescos. The typography is cleverly arranged  around the image, helping to create an interesting document from the days when ethnology and the exhibition of primitive art were still fairly new."
