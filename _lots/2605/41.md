TYPESET: "The emigrant Russian artistic community in Montparnasse became very active in the years before World War I and the large ball they hosted every year in order to raise money for their association was one of the highlights of the Parisian avant-garde season. Gontcharova was the very rich, eccentric granddaughter of Alexander Pushkin, who lived her extravagant life with her partner Mikhail Larianov. A Diaghilev devotee, she dedicated most of her considerable artistic talents to stage and costume design. She worked for the most prestigious theaters, operas, and ballet companies, from Rimsky-Korsakov's revolutionary <i>Coq d'Or</i>, to her final creations for the Marquis de Cuevas Ballet, in 1948. Like avant-garde painter Mikhail Larionov in 1923, Gontcharova designed the poster for the artists' ball at Bullier in 1926. Using black, brown, and orange cut-outs, she built a graphically-complex, cubist-inspired design of what looks like two figures crouched under a tree. This is the version before letters. Weill 322, Le Peintre et L'Affiche, Union des Arts Decoratifs, Paris, 1988, p. 69, Plakat Kunst p. 94, Kunstler Plakate p. 9."
