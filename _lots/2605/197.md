CROSSHEAD: RAYMOND CHANDLER / FILM NOIR. 1979.
TYPESET: "<p>After studying in Switzerland, Brühwiler spent five years in Paris and
  then moved to Los Angeles where he worked with Saul Bass. He then returned to Switzerland,
  working in Zurich before settling in Luzern, where he taught and painted. Among
  the many posters he did for Swiss cultural institutions, the series he did for the
  Film Podium in Zurich, which span over twenty years, is by far his most famous.
  In an ever-changing style, he advertised films from all areas of movie history.
  Here, in a gritty, hard-boiled film-noir manner he graphically portrays a villainous
  image from a Raymond Chandler film. (<em>Pabru Plakate Bilder</em>, Benteli, Wabern
