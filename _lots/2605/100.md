DESCRIPT: "CHARLES LOUPOT (1892-1962)"
CROSSHEAD: "CAILLER / CHOCOLAT AU LAIT. 1921."
TYPESET: "After studying in Lyon, Loupot fought in the First World War and was wounded. He returned from the front and settled in Lausanne, where his parents were living, and quickly began his successful career as a poster designer. Most of his work was for the fashion and luxury goods industries. His style, a combination of the high-profile Swiss School and his own light French touch, worked very well for the products he was asked to advertise. This poster epitomizes the sophistication that was his visual calling card. The elegant young woman, who has pulled a chocolate bar out of her bag, almost appears to be guiltily sneaking her indulgence. She is dressed in warm colors against a dark background, and through Loupot's unique handling of lithography, he has made the image and the typography appear to vibrate. Loupot / Zagrodzki 44, Loupot / Musee de l'Affiche 10, Chocolate p. 60, L'Affiche Art Deco p. 27."
