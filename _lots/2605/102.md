TYPESET: "As Zagrodski notes in his book, Loupot's work for St. Raphaël \"can be qualified as the work of his life.\" From 1937-1960 Loupot worked hand in hand with Max Augier, the advertising director of St. Raphaël, creating a series of posters that tell of a unique saga in the story of advertising. Working with the stylization of red and white-clad waiters, Loupot gradually moved towards creating more and more abstracted images. This is one of the earliest posters he designed for the company. It is also one of the first appearances of the company's name in a cursive script rather than block letters. Loupot 86, Loupot / Zagrodski 106, Reina Sofia p. 134."
