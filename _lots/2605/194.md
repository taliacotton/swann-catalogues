TYPESET: "Steven Heller, writing in the catalogue of the artist's work for the Zürich Museum, states that Hofmann's posters \"collectively epitomize mid-century modernism . . . [in his poster for] <i>William Tell</i>, he used the typically sonorous economy of his resources to show what a fundamental change applied art was undergoing. The Tell play is firmly established in popular Swiss culture . . . Hofmann takes up the indispensable symbols of the Tell legend, the apple and the arrow, but uses typeface and image to condense them into a symbolic abstraction of an elegance unparalleled for this subject matter.\" Hofmann p. 65, Muller-Brockmann 113, The Poster p. 333, Modern Poster 229, Swiss Poster Art 63.2, Margadant 118, Encyclopedie de l'Affiche p. 242, MoMA 618.1981."
