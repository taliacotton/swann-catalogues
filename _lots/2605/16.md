CROSSHEAD: DAS PLAKAT. Set of 10 hardcover volumes. 1912-1921.
TYPESET: Founded in 1905 by Hans Sachs (a dentist in Berlin), the Verein der Plakat
  Freunde (Association of Friends of the Poster) began publishing <i>Das Plakat</i>
  (The Poster) in 1910. The publication, printed in German, ran through 1922 and its
  influence cannot be understated. Each issue is a treasure trove of information,
  and includes many color reproductions and tipped-in illustrations. Its publication
  was not continuous, and was slightly irregular, interrupted by the First World War,
  but we believe this to be one of the most complete sets of this leading and important
  journal.  Images available upon request.
at-a-glance: Sizes vary, each approximately 11½x9½ inches, 29¼x24 cm.
FOOTNOTE: 'Condition varies, generally B+ / A-: some pages and tip-ins missing or
  loose; certain volumes with edge-wear and staining. Each bound, some in Lucian Bernhard
  covers.'
