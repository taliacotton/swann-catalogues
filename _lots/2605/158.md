CROSSHEAD: "ROLEX OYSTER PERPETUAL / RADIUM DIALS. Circa 1942."
TYPESET: "Rolex's original patent for their \"Error Proof Radium dials,\" which became known (in the 1980s) as the 'California Dial,' was granted on June 15, 1942. Ironically their proof-reading was not error-proof, as the word 'Radium' is misspelled here where it first appears. The design of the face of the bubble-back watch features a combination of bold Arabic and Roman numerals. The patent states, \"that this particular arrangement will give a clear view of the hours, will be easy to create with luminous materials, and will allow easy reading of the time – especially within wristwatch cases, where the dials are relatively small.\" The dial is a significant milestone in Rolex history, as it became the basis for the dials on the company's Submariner, SEA-DWELLER and GMT Master watches. Rolex purists have also pointed out the unusual crown logo on this poster. Rolex ceased use of radium in 1963, due to the cancer-causing nature of the element. <i>Rare.</i>"
