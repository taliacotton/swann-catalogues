TYPESET: "Rössler, primarily a Leipzig and Dresden-based specialist in decorative painting, and Klemm who worked in the same field, joined forces to create this Jugendstil image with Secessionist accents. The swirly border and typography are clearly Jugendstil. The central figure, although academically rendered and highly symbolic, is treated in a modern and daring way - in flashy orange, with a boldness and simplicity that bespeak Secessionist themes. DFP-III 2720, Kunst-Ereignisse cover and plate 20, Wember, p. 108."
