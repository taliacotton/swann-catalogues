DESCRIPT: ADOLPHE MOURON CASSANDRE (1901-1968)
CROSSHEAD: TRIPLEX. Pencil and gouache maquette. 1930.
TYPESET: '<p>To promote this shatterproof safety glass, Cassandre designed one of
  his strongest images - a nearly monochromatic poster. Every detail of this stylized
  driver - his wide eyes fixed on the road ahead and his hands tightly grasping the
  steering wheel - helps to evoke his complete concentration. The only barrier between
  the driver and the potential dangers of the road is a rectangle of Triplex glass.
  This drawing, with text that does not appear in the poster, preceded Cassandre''s
  full-size color maquette for the poster, also dated 1930. (The<em> </em><a href="https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/Lots/auction-lot/ADOLPHE-MOURON-CASSANDRE-(1901-1968)-TRIPLEX-1931-47x31-inch?saleno=2510&amp;lotNo=106&amp;refNo=759177"
