DESCRIPT: "ADOLPHE MOURON CASSANDRE (1901-1968)"
CROSSHEAD: "NEW STATENDAM / HOLLAND - AMERICA LINE. 1928."
TYPESET: "Launched in 1924, construction problems delayed the maiden voyage of the <i>Statendam</i> until April 11, 1929. Known as the \"Queen of the Spotless Fleet,\" she served the Holland-America Line until 1940, when she was destroyed during World War II. To promote her first crossing, Cassandre developed this compelling close-up view of funnels and ventilation cowls, with stylized waves of smoke billowing out overhead. Cassandre's love of sea travel found him \"constantly renewing himself, constantly varying not only his point of view and angle but also his style\" (Mouron p. 64). This poster not only represents another unique vantage point from which to view technology, but is \"a prime example of Cassandre's attention to tonal values. The color scheme . . . brings a wonderfully sober equilibrium to the composition\" (ibid. p.66).
