TYPESET: '<p>Perhaps the most famous image in Nitsche''s General Dynamics series,
  this depicts the <em>USS Nautilus</em>, one of the country''s first nuclear powered
  submarines. "It was an indelible logo in its day. Set against a graduated gray background,
  the shell was a virtual cornucopia of progress. The submarine was not seen as a
  killing machine, but rather the offspring of progress poised to help the world"
  (<a href="https://www.typotheque.com/articles/erik_nitsche_the_reluctant_modernist"
  title=""><em>Eric Nitsche: The Reluctant Modernist</em></a>). It should be noted
  that the ongoing project to construct the <em>Nautilus</em> was so top secret that
  Nitsche was only provided a basic idea of what the submarine would ultimately look
  like. This is the English version from the initial Atoms for Peace series. Dynamic
