DESCRIPT: "THOMAS THEODOR HEINE (1867-1948)"
CROSSHEAD: "WEITE WELT. 1901."
TYPESET: "Professor Joseph Popp, writing about <i>Pioneers of German Poster Art</i> for <i>Das Plakat's</i> September 1917 issue, explains that while Heine's style draws from \"both Japanese art and the work of Aubrey Beardsley, that he developed his own style, which goes back and forth between naive and refined simplicity, while occasionally taking other directions, without having any specific role model\" (<i>Das Plakat</i>, September 1, 1917 p. 265). This pose of a reclining woman reading a magazine was somewhat of a graphic meme at the time, with similar tableaux appearing in <i>Pel & Ploma</i>, by Ramon Casas in 1899, and <i>Lesen Sie</i>, by Kolomon Moser in 1900. DFP-III 1217, Kunst im Alltag 201, Chemnitz 51."
