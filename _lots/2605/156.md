TYPESET: "Not much biographical information is known about Hierl, a German artist from Munich. He designed several posters for car and motorcycle races and in 1936, he won a silver medal in the art competitions of the Berlin Olympic Games for his poster <i>Internationales Avusrennen</i> (\"International Avus Race\"). He was an official war artist during World War II. The artist's design choice to extend the flag pole past the image, through to the bottom of the poster, sets the viewer right next to the track, with just a slightly obscured view of the race. The Nürburgring, constructed in 1927, is one of the most famous racetracks in the world."
