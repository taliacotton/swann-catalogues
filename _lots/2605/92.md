DESCRIPT: BERNARD BÉCAN (1890-1943)
CROSSHEAD: FIÈVRE DE LOUIS DELLUC. Circa 1921.
TYPESET: '<p>Bécan was an illustrator, painter and poster designer with a handful
  of impressive Art Deco posters to his credit. This exceptional, atmospheric image
  captures all of the romance, intrigue, sleaze, debauchery, flavor and lust of the
  dirty Marseille bar where this story takes place. The film, directed by Louis Delluc,
  is the story of a brutish owner of a bar, his wife and her former lover who has
  sailed into port from the Orient with a new young woman by his side. Pictured are
  the sailor and Sarah (the wife of the owner) dancing, with her husband looking on
  with an unpleasant countenance. The tulip, pictured prominently, also plays an important,
  symbolic role in the story. Rather ironically, the movie being promoted by this
  enormous poster was a short film. An excellent review of the film and the director
  can be found here: <a href="http://www.frenchfilms.org/review/fievre-1921.html."
