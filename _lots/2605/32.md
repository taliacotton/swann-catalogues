TYPESET: "One of the founding fathers of the Swiss poster school, Stoecklin played with geometry, surrealism and hyper-surrealism throughout his career, always with great success. This exemplary 1928 poster for a construction exhibition plays with the letter Z (as in Zurich), turning it into a row of buildings with the title cleverly arranged on the blue rooftops. This strict geometric approach parallels the subject, making for a bold and powerful image. <i>Rare.</i> We could find only two other examples at auction in the last 20 years. Stoecklin p. 56, Zeitzieger p. 202."
