TYPESET: "Austin Cooper was a stylistic virtuoso and a prolific artist, whose first commercial venture was a graphic design studio in his native Canada. His highly-pictorial, Art Deco style received widespread public acclaim and he quickly found work with many of Britain's most important poster-commissioning companies, such as the London Underground, the LNER and the Empire Marketing Board. \"The EMB included representations of this world-leading industry in its posters, showing it to be mighty, masterful and technologically advanced\" (EMB Posters, np). Cooper's dramtically-lit manufacturing scene, with a glimpse of a factory worker, was designed to illustrate the \"economic ties that connected industrial workers in Britain with the rest of the Empire\" (ibid.). B.O.5. Issued by the Empire Marketing Board."
