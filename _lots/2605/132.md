CROSSHEAD: GENERAL MOTOR AT THE NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR. 1939.
TYPESET: '<p>A <em>rare</em> poster for the most popular exhibit at the New York World''s
  Fair in 1939: General Motors'' Futurama. The entire General Motors "Highways and
  Horizons exhibit occupied a seven-acre site on the Avenue of Transportation" (World
  of Tomorrow p. 108). The Futurama itself was a detailed model of America in the
  future (the world in 1960, a distant 20 years from the time of the fair), over and
  around which visitors were whisked while sitting in sound chairs on a carry-go-round.
  Looking down on the model, visitors listened to a narrator explain all that they
  were seeing. </p><p>The exhibition, "designed by Norman Bel Geddes, covers more
  than 35,000 square feet and contains 500,000 individually designed houses and buildings
  and over 1,000,000 trees and shrubs of 18 species and 50,000 scale model vehicles"
  (General Motors Exhibit Building / New York World''s Fair, 1939, brochure). The
  ride, which covered countryside, highways and future cities, ended up with visitors
  actually standing in a full-scale street intersection of the future. "It was all
  brilliantly conceived-a magnificently entertaining journey into the future by hundreds
  of thousands of consumers-only to be dropped off onto a ''1960'' stage set filled
  with the gleaming, streamlined [General Motors] products of 1939 just waiting to
  be bought" (World of Tomorrow p. 111).</p>'
