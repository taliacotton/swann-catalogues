TYPESET: "Born in Germany, Reiss and his family emigrated to Britain in 1937, where he went on to become a prominent graphic designer. By the late-1940s and early-1950s, he was one of the most prolific British poster designers. His major clients were the General Post Office and the Post Office Savings Bank, but he also worked for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. Reiss' posters are always cleanly designed and easy to understand, often composed of simple drawings with a photomontage or photographed elements, plus a touch of humor. In that humorous vein, comes his image, where a traveler has a propellor for a hat and his body is a contorted route map, visually suggesting that with air travel, distant parts of the world get closer."
