TYPESET: "Fix-Masseau spent some time working as an assistant to Cassandre. It is unclear whether the young artist got the commission to design this poster through Cassandre's atelier, or after he left and opened his own studio. In the latter case, this poster would be Fix-Masseau's first personal commission. The Chemins de Fer du Nord, for whom Cassandre designed his best railway posters, also had a network of buses connected to their train routes to reach smaller towns. Conceptually, Fix-Masseau designed this poster following Cassandre's guidelines, apparent in the grouping of the typography at the top and bottom of the image, and the perspective of the vehicles. Stylistically, Fix-Masseau clearly differs from Cassandre, in that his machines are less geometric and bear a more delicate illustrator's touch. Railway Posters 141."
