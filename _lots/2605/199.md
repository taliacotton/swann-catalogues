Among their groundbreaking hallmarks were handwritten typography and a mixture of mediums including photography and drawing. Early on, their work had a political leaning, in that they worked for municipal (Communist) governments, the public theater and other social institutions. As their fame grew, they progressively took on more mainstream commissions. Images available upon request."
