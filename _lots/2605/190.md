TYPESET: "Heiniger was an accomplished artist, designer, photographer and cinematographer. Here, introducing the new technology of telephones to the general Swiss public, he accomplishes efficient information delivery by using a photomontage and an arrow to delineate where a person should speak so they can be heard clearly on the other end. He designed a number of posters, including several others promoting the use of telephones, each with a pronounced photographic element. \"The large lettering is hand drawn, the telephone set and the face are separate photographs montaged together. This technique was the forerunner of Müller-Brockmann's photographic road safety posters who owes a great deal to Heiniger\" (Swiss Graphic Design p. 192). This is the German version. Swiss Graphic Design p. 192 (var)."
