TYPESET: "The Shamir brothers were born in Latvia, then studied graphics and design in Berlin, and in 1935, set up a studio, the \"Shamir Brothers,\" in Tel Aviv.  One of their most iconic commissions was the design of the State of Israel Coat of Arms in 1949. This psychedelic blacklight poster was clearly influenced by the design aesthetic of the American rock and roll posters of the era, but the prominent \"Lee\" label on the Grandson's jeans suggests that this may be an advertisement for the clothing company."
