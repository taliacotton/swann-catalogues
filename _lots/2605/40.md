CROSSHEAD: "[MEYERHOLD THEATER / THE FOREST]. Circa 1925."
TYPESET: '<p>Vsevolod Meyerhold was known as a prominent actor and director at his
  self-named theater in Moscow between 1923 and 1938. A visionary director who was
  revolutionary in his style, Meyerhold pioneered the concept of biomechanics: "Its
  purpose was to widen the emotional potential of a theater piece and express thoughts
  and ideas that could not be easily presented through the naturalistic theater of
  the period" (Wikipedia). </p><p>In a collection of articles published in 1926 by
  the Meyerhold Theatre, Alexander Slonimsky wrote: "<em>The Forest</em> reflects
  the revolutionary upsurge at the beginning of the 1870s, and it is for this reason
  that Meyerhold chose to stage this play in particular. In it, the object of the
  satire is not the mercantile middle class as is usually the case with Ostrovsky,
  but the landowning gentry in decline after the abolition of serfdom" <a href="(https://monoskop.org/images/8/88/Braun_Edward_Meyerhold_A_Revolution_in_Theatre.pdf"
  title="A Revolution in Theatre">(</a><a href="(https://monoskop.org/images/8/88/Braun_Edward_Meyerhold_A_Revolution_in_Theatre.pdf"
  title="">A Revolution in Theatre</a>). Receiving much critical response and inspiring
  over 50 articles over the following months, "<em>The Forest</em> remained permanently
  in Meyerhold''s repertoire for the next fourteen years, being performed over 1700
  times" (ibid). </p><p>Many of the broadsides used to promote plays at the theatre
  reflect avant-garde typographic influences which were prevalent in the Soviet Union
  during the 1920s and 30s. These posters were often designed by the same person who
  designed the sets and costumes for specific productions. The designs of these letterpress
  posters are consistent with the constructivist ideals of the theatre; they feature
  letter forms without adornment and through letterpress printing emphasize the importance
  of each small piece of type. <em>Rare</em>.</p>'
