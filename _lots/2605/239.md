DESCRIPT: GÜNTHER KIESER (1930- )
CROSSHEAD: AMERICAN FOLK BLUES FESTIVAL. Group of 5 posters.
TYPESET: Kieser essentially dedicated his entire career to posters promoting jazz
  and blues concerts. He has designed hundreds of posters, the most memorable of which
  are images of three-dimensional tableaux that he constructed using diverse objects
  that caught his inspirational attention. He was also a major proponent of graphic
  découpage, in which he brought various images together to help form a cohesive message.
  The first image he designed for the Hamburg Folk Blues Festival was in 1968; the
  guitar at the center of the image is covered with "American" objects and photographs.
  He would continue to use the guitar in his subsequent posters for the event (in
  each case adorned differently), so much so that it became an immediately recognizable
  logo. Includes one duplicate. Images available upon request.

FOOTNOTE: Condition varies, generally A. Two large posters hand-signed in pencil.
