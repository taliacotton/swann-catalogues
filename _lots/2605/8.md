TYPESET: "In 1906, at the age of 23, Lucian Bernhard won a poster design competition sponsored by Priester matches. Ernst Growald, the director of the Berlin printing establishment Hollerbaum & Schmidt, recognized his talent and immediately hired Bernhard. The young artist quickly developed a graphic design system that proved to be revolutionary in the advertising world. Bernhard was the father of the Sachsplakat (Object Poster), a style in which the object is depicted in flat colors, with no ornamentation and no shadow, against a monochromatic background with very large, bold typography. This <i>rare</i> design for A.W. Faber pencils (the first brand name pencil) epitomizes this style."
