DESCRIPT: "ERNST BÖHM (1890-1963)"
CROSSHEAD: "EDITH HEINEMANN IM HOTEL STADT WIEN. 1935."
TYPESET: "While Böhm is known to have designed at least six posters, all of which were made during the 1930s, he looms even larger in the world of Arts and Crafts design. A professor in the field during the Weimar period, Böhm traveled as a lecturer and produced designs for wallpaper, fabrics, pottery, typography and most notably, stamps. Although this poster for a Carnival evening promotes an appearance by Edith Heinemann, the master violinist, Böhm instead chose to illustrate a stylized masked harlequin. Heinemann, more widely known by her maiden name Lorand, was a Berlin-based violin virtuoso from a Hungarian-Jewish family, whose 20-year career on the Viennese stage endeared her with the titles of \"Queen of the Waltz\" and the \"Female John Strauss\" prior to her flight from Nazi Germany in 1937."
