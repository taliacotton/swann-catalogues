CROSSHEAD: "GIACOMETTI / KUNSTHALLE BASEL. 1966."
TYPESET: "Despite being based in the United States as a design consultant for the Guggenheim Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, as well as teaching at Yale, Matter accepted a few European commissions, such as this poster he designed for the Kunsthalle Basel. The strict layout lends itself well to Giacometti's elongated figure, which runs straight up through the center of the image. The use of non-Helvetica typography seems to be an intentional departure for Matter, in contrast to what his Swiss colleagues would have done. MoMA 797.1983."
