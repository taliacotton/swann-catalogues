CROSSHEAD: "INTERNATIONALE TENTOONSTELLING / KLANK EN BEELD. 1932."
TYPESET: "This poster created for \"a 1932 international sound and image exhibition in Amsterdam, captures the essence of the subject matter with a powerful, stylized, red art deco bust, which has sound waves and visual projections emanating from its ear and eye. The exhibition covered all the bases - radio, television, sound recordings, music, photography, and even the latest craze, talking pictures, even though the first Dutch-language sound film wouldn't be released until the following year\" (Crouse p. 110). This is a very early, if not the first poster to mention television; TVs weren't widely used in European homes until the 1950s. This image was also used on a postage stamp, and there is a smaller version in black, blue and red, on a white background, by a different printer. Crouse p. 110."
