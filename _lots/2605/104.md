TYPESET: "Duncan yo-yos hit the market in 1929 and quickly became an international sensation. Gid's design, using only two colors, encapsulates the sheer joy of the toy through three intricate characters that are not only playing with yo-yos, but are embodiments of the toy itself. Their heads, each with one large eye, resemble yo-yos, and even the letters seem to dance. A clever mixture of Art Deco and humor. Raymond Gid 24, Encyclopedie de l'Affiche p. 86, L'Affiche Art Deco p. 187."
