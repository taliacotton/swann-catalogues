TYPESET: "Sutnar, as Artistic Director of <i>Druzstevni Prace</i>, was responsible for the artistic design of this periodical, the covers of which are all like mini posters. Following Karel Teige's belief that \"the cover was an advertisement for the book . . . and to make this desirable poster-like balance as strong an impact as possible [the artist must choose] primary colors and geometric shapes,\" Sutnar added his own elements of photomontage and typography to Teige's concept of cover design (Oxford, p. 59). His aesthetic helped to further promote Functionalist design into mainstream society. Among the artists whose work is featured in this lifestyle magazine, both written and visual, are Josef Sudek, Jaromir Funke, Alexander Hackenschmied, Karel Teige, Vladimir Krejcar, Le Corbusier, Man Ray, Max Ernst and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. These issues frequently appear bound together; it is <i>rare</i> to find them loose, as issued. This group includes eight issues from 1931, ten from 1932, and two from 1933. Berman / Juan March p. 144, Page Design p. 189, Modernism p. 274, Witkovsky pl. 42, Sutnar p. 64. Images available upon request."
