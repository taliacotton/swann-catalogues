TYPESET: "Falcucci's career spanned multiple decades and several thematic milieus. He began designing car racing posters for the Monaco Grand Prix in 1930, and went on to design travel posters and images for Air France. His later work is punctuated by bright, near fluorescent colors. Here, he uses a simple primary color scheme and stylized map to show the many routes by which Algeria is accessible from France and other parts of Europe. To emphasize the speed used to make the trip, he portrays two steaming vehicles cruising powerfully toward their destinations."
