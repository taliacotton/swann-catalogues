CROSSHEAD: FILM FESTIVAL - LINCOLN CENTER. 1967.
TYPESET: <p>This is a proof, aside from the signed and numbered edition of 200. Published
  by Leo Castelli Gallery, New York, to commemorate the Fifth New York Film Festival
  at Lincoln Center. The difference between this edition and the edition of 500 is
  that the black graphic text "FIFTH NEW YORK" is placed directly over the text "Film
  Festival of Lincoln Center;" in the edition of 500, the text black text "FIFTH NEW
  YORK" is placed on top of the white text. An innovative feature that appears in
  this special edition is a perforated line running across the surface of the print,
  at its triangular cut out sides, mimicking the tear line present in real commercial
  movie admissions tickets. Chiron Press, commissioned by Lincoln Center, devised
  a special process expressly to imprint the edition with this perforation using a
  die cut stamp. </p><p>Images of an Era 72 and cover, Modern Poster 255, Modern American
