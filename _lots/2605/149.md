DESCRIPT: PAOLO FEDERICO GARRETTO (1903-1991)
CROSSHEAD: AMILCAR / ELLE EST PASSÉE! 1929.
TYPESET: "<p>Garretto employs two established visual techniques to help convey his
  message; the advertised car has passed out of the frame, leaving only tire tracks
  and a plume of smoke behind. Yet, clearly it was such a car that it caught the eye
  and the attention of a trendy and handsomely dressed couple, who stand on the street
  corner looking after it. For the rest of us who were too slow to see it, there happens
  to be a poster within the poster depicting the car (ingeniously posted over other
  posters, whose corners are visible). Garretto was primarily a political cartoonist
  who became an international artistic star in the 1920s. He also received large commissions
  from American magazines like <em>Vanity Fair</em>, and began spending three or four
  months every year in the States. Auto s'Affiche p. 66.</p>"
