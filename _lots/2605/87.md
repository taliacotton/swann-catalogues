The retailer of upmarket clothing, known for its menswear, was founded in 1900 and had seventy outlets throughout Britain . . . With superb simplicity and just two colors - black and white - Purvis creates a classic vision of formal wear: gloves, top hat, overcoat, striped scarf, bow tie, trousers, and vest\" (Crouse p. 153). He designed a number of posters for the retailer during the 1920s, and \"these works created in the 'flat method' with vivid contrasting colors are amongst Purvis's most well known and respected\" (Purvis p. 20). Purvis p. 48,  Crouse p. 152."
