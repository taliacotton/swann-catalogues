TYPESET: This portfolio of playful typographic designs features the award-winning
  typefaces of the 1966 International Typeface Design Competition. Best known for
  his illustrative typography - and his work with the magazines <i>Avant Garde</i>,
  <i>Fact</i> and <i>Eros</i>, Lubalin was a prolific designer of advertisements,
  typeface, posters, logos and more. His trademark for <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>
  was used for several years, and also designed the trademark for the World Trade
  Center when it was founded. Not satisfied with the prevailing “Swiss Style” of design,
  he was keen to create a style that Americans would react to, called “graphic expressionism”
  – using typography to illustrate ideas. Typefaces created by Lubalin include ITC
  Avant Garde, Pistilli Roman, Lubalin Graph and Ronda. Includes duplicates. Images
  available upon request.
