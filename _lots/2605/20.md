DESCRIPT: ADOLFO HOHENSTEIN (1854-1928)
CROSSHEAD: ESPOSIZIONE D'IGIENE / NAPOLI. 1900.
TYPESET: <p>Hohenstein designed this monumental and beautifully ornate poster for
  the <em>National Hygiene Exhibition</em> in Naples. Touting the benefits of fresh
  air and water, Hohenstein illustrates a "Fountain of Life," being enjoyed by a Classically-styled
  nude family, with a peacock at their side. Set off by gold ink background, florals
  and undulating decorative frames, the rich blue ink of the poster further emphasizes
  the element of water. The swirling lines separating the text from image are reminiscent
  of the artist's poster of the same year for <em>Monte Carlo / Tir Aux Pigeons</em>
