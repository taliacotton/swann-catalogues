TYPESET: "Although he was active as a poster designer throughout his life, Gid is best known as a book designer and a master French typographer. In 1930, he wound up in North America on an ethnographic mission to study Canadian Indians. Through the connection he established with the Ethnographic Museum, he was asked to design this poster. The museum, located at the Trocadero, was closed for renovations in 1930, in order to refurbish it before a grand reopening a year later for a major colonial exhibition. Paul Colin designed a famous image to announce the event (see Swann Sale 2079, lot 37). This poster by Gid is for the first exhibition dedicated to the French colonies. The Oceanian idol and the typography are cleverly tilted to catch the eye in a pure Art Deco layout. This poster is a rare and early document pertaining to tribal arts exhibitions, a field that reached its pinnacle 75 years after this poster was designed with the opening of Paris' Quai Branly Museum. Gid p. 100, Fornay 16."
