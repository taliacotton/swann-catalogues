CROSSHEAD: NO VIETNAMESE EVER CALLED ME NIGGER. 1968.
TYPESET: A striking poster created to promote David Loeb Weiss' film <i>No Vietnamese
  Ever Called Me Nigger</i>, which won the award for Best Documentary at the Mannheim
  Film Festival in 1968. The title refers to a quote often misattributed to Muhammad
  Ali. It was a popular rallying cry during anti-Vietnam War demonstrations at the
  time, and can be seen in the film on the placards carried by protesters in the 1967
  Harlem Fall Mobilization March. This event was the racially and politically-charged
  focus of the documentary, composed of footage of the march itself interspersed with
  interviews from protesters and Black Vietnam veterans. The result was a shockingly
  frank firsthand report, which a review in Open City called "the strongest statement
  yet from the Black community . . . a startling cry of rage and despair . . . As
  a study on why there is rebellion in the streets of Black America it is more succinct
  and illuminating than any government report can ever be." Glaser p. 95.
