Mathematical, but still feeling\" (Graphis 135, vol 24, p. 10). \"It was after a trip to Europe on which he had been impressed by the civic graphics of Zurich and other cities that John Massey conceived the idea of a planned civic graphics programme for Chicago . . . America's first civic cultural communications programme seeks to express through graphic design the virtues and diversity of the city's cultural life\" (ibid. p. 14).
