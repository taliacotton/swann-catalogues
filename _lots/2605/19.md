CROSSHEAD: '"PRIMAVERA" VEGLIONE DELLA FAMIGLIA ARTISTICA. 1898.'
TYPESET: <p>Born in Russia to German parents, Hohenstein studied art in Vienna before
  settling in Milan. He began working with Ricordi, the great Italian publishing company
  in 1889, designing sheet music covers for operas. Shortly thereafter, he became
  Art Director of the firm and began to design posters himself. Working for him at
  Ricordi were among the most famous Italian poster artists of the era, such as Dudovich,
  Mauzan and Metlicovitz, whose posters reflect Hohenstein's influence as one of the
  masters of the Golden Age of Italian posters, "from obvious stylistic floral influences
  of French Art Nouveau and the German Jugendstil" (Manifesti Italiano, p. 114). </p><p>Hohenstein
  was invited to work outside of Italy, in France as well as Belgium, where he designed
  at least two posters printed by the Belgian printing house J.L. Goffart. The Liberty
  Style at the turn of the century was triumphant in Italy, while the fascination
  for posters had begun to wane in France. This playful image advertises one of the
  Milan Carnivals that were fashionable in the late nineteenth and first half of the
  twentieth century, usually a week or so after the Venice Carnival in February or
  March. Many of these balls and celebrations were organized by municipal organizations
  or the "Milanese artistic family" - this one at the Teatro Lirico. A <em>rare</em>
  poster, in an unusual narrow format; another copy can be found in the Collezione
  Salce of the Museo Nationale in Treviso. Not in Ricordi.</p>
