LOT: "66"
LOW: "1200"
HIGH: "1800"
DESCRIPT: "WILLEM FREDERICK TEN BROEK (1905-1993)"
CROSSHEAD: "HOLLAND - AMERIKA LINIE. 1936."
TYPESET: "By employing a dramatic, Cassandre-esque, low-angle perspective of a sleek ocean liner, twisting it a little to the side and adding an Art Deco curve to its profile, Ten Broek creates a powerful, sweeping image. Unlike Cassandre's ship posters, which feature specific vessels, Ten Broek is not heralding the launch of a new liner, but rather glorifying the company and the concept of sea travel as a whole. This is the German version. Poster Progress p. 104, Modern Dutch 101, Schipp & Affiche 27, Art Deco Graphics p. 73, Encyclopedie de l'Affiche p. 207, Weallans p. 157, Crouse p. 228 (var), L'Affiche Art Deco p. 70."
