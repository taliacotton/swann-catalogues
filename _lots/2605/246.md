As a master of photomontage and collage, in 1968 he was called upon to create the visuals for <i>Opus International</i>, an avant-garde art magazine. He wound up designing a series of highly stylized pop images for the publication. This one, which was used as the cover for issue 4, was also published as a poster. With its simple, garish colors and cartoon-style image, it remains today a classic of the Pop Era. Cieslewicz p. 34."
