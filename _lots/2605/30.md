TYPESET: "Peter Birkhäuser studied at the Decorative Arts School in Basel and apprenticed in Stoecklin's studio before setting out on his own as a poster designer. He became one of Switzerland's most accomplished \"New Objectivity\" artists, designing posters for brands such as PKZ, Globus, Rheinbrucke and Bata. In a twist of irony and shift in mid-life creative interests, Birkauser moved on from his signature realistic object design to a new fascination with illustrating images from thousands of his dreams. His friendship and mentorship with Carl Jung led to a less popularly-received late-career oeuvre of psychoanalyzed dreamscape paintings."
