TYPESET: <p>One of the greatest American posters of the 20th Century, Beall's optimistic,
  patriotic and progressive image is a monumental work whose aesthetic simplicity
  masks a complex design that reveals "the artist's distinctly American counterpart
  to European modernism" (Mechanical Age p. 174). In fact, in many ways this image
  can be seen as the American version of El Lissitsky's <em>Russische Ausstellung</em>
  (see Swann Sale 2039, lot 77), with the boy and the girl gazing hopefully and happily
  into their future. "The image speaks for itself in this almost-textless photomontage,
  a brilliant combination of realism and abstraction. These are 'poster children'
  for the REA - happy beneficiaries of the program, in the present and the future
  . . . The flag motif serves several purposes. It signifies the overarching protection
  of the New Deal; the 'matched' white stripes and fence rails subtly reinforce the
  connection between America and the farm; and it provides further visual interest,
  as the band of blue below the stripes somehow still functions as sky."</p><p>Beall
