  <br><br>In this portrait caricature based on a photograph by Mitchell''s wife, Therese,
  DeGroff remembers the famous literary chronicler of New York City''s underbelly,
  gritty characters, and waterways at his favorite eatery. Beloved by dock workers
  and white collar workers alike, the legendary South Street Seaport fish restaurant
  was located in the former Fulton Ferry Hotel. Mitchell immortalized Sloppy Louie''s
  and its owner, his friend Louis Morini, in his famous work <em>Up in the Old Hotel</em>
  (1952). In the artist''s words: "To better understand the world, Joe followed the
  working hands; the folks who were an integral part of the sea''s after-life, be
  it working the Fulton Fish Market, preparing food from it, or just being in it day
  after day, year after year . . . he needed to stay connected to this rapidly disappearing
  world. His glory was to get up close to humanity, to `Get in the habit of looking
  at people'', he said; ''that''s the sum of it, really.''" <br><br>See artist''s
  bio above lot 87.</p>'
