  and silver metal frame measuring 27x24-inch frame. Signed and dated a year after
  creation "Braldt Bralds `01." <br><br>For the magazine's emotionally charged cover
  story concerning the demise of the biological family that is closer to Homo sapiens
  than any other form of life and whose diminishing population levels threaten them
  with extinction, Bralds portrayed “Bruder AFFE” cleverly and adeptly, as a cross
  between the sculptor Rodin’s famous “Thinker” and Shakespeare’s Hamlet, contemplating
  mortality as he considers his late friend Yorick’s skull. <br><br>Bralds, a mostly
  self-taught artist from the Netherlands, has been a prolific and sought-after illustrator
  for several decades. He was launched into fame beginning in 1978 when he received
  his first commission with a cover for <i>TIME</i> magazine soon followed by his
  indelible image of the proud Morgaine on horseback gracing the cover of <i>The Mists
  of Avalon,</i> Marion Zimmer Bradley's 1983 women-focused historical fiction bestseller
  about Arthurian legends. Bralds' impressive client list includes such notable publications
  as <i>Newsweek, Omni Magazine, The Washington Post, Rolling Stone, Atlantic Monthly,
  Esquire, Playboy, Penthouse, National Geographic,</i> and more. His work has been
  featured in ad campaigns for Alfa Romeo, Atlantic Records, Grand Marnier, Gucci,
  IBM International, Kahlua, Levi-Strauss, Pirelli Brazil, among others. <br>He has
  designed three stamp issues for the United Nations Postal Service and the United
  States Postal Service. In the late 1990s, Bralds transitioned to a fine art career,
  displaying his work in exhibits and galleries throughout the world. <br> A long
  list of awards includes a Hall of Fame recognition from the Dutch Society of Illustrators,
  an Andy Award, and a Clio Award. From The Society of Illustrators, he has won several
  medals, the coveted Hamilton King Award in 1984 and, just this spring of 2021, was
  inducted into their prestigious Hall of Fame.
