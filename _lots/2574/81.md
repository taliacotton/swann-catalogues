TYPESET: <p>Illustration for the cover of <em>Der Spiegel,</em> August 28, 2000. Oil
  on wood panel. 15x12¾ inches; 381x323 mm. Archivally float-mounted in archival matte
  and silver metal frame measuring 27x24-inch frame. Signed and dated a year after
  creation "Braldt Bralds `01." <br><br>For the magazine's emotionally charged cover
  story concerning the demise of the biological family that is closer to Homo sapiens
  than any other form of life and whose diminishing population levels threaten them
  with extinction, Bralds portrayed “Bruder AFFE” cleverly and adeptly, as a cross
  between the sculptor Rodin’s famous “Thinker” and Shakespeare’s Hamlet, contemplating
  mortality as he considers his late friend Yorick’s skull. <br><br>See artist's bio
