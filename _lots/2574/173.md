  showing disgust as they enter a woman's foul-smelling home. Once the woman cures
  her "house-i-tosis" with the pleasant scent of Wizard Air Freshener, a group of
  men throw off their hats in excitement as they rush into the woman's home and lay
  at her feet, eagerly sniffing the air near a can of Wizard.
