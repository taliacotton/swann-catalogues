TYPESET: 'for the work published by The Fantod Press, New York, 1971. Three separate
  sheets. Ink on paper. The first sheet measures 215x280 mm;  8½x11 inches and contains
  a detailed drawing of the book cover plus 6 smaller sketches for the layouts of
  the final 6 illustrative panels and a list of titles to potential stories, including
  "The Loathsome Couple," drawn on yellow paper. Signed "Edward Gorey" somewhat hastily
  on the base of the urn in the main image. Tipped to floating window matte and framed.<br>Matted
  together are two additional 8½x11-inch sheets containing numerous character and
  panel composition sketches along with some trial title and lettering designs. Ink
  and graphite on paper. Signed three times by way of Gorey''s titling.  Mounted along
  verso to double vertical window matte measuring 26¼x17¾ inches. <br><br>Provenance:
  Aleph-Bet Books, 2011; private collection. <br><br>The devil depicted in the sketches
  is strikingly similar to 17th century woodcut images of the Pendle Witches, a group
  of women accused of witchcraft in Lanscashire, England in 1612. These images were
  circulated in America, especially around Gorey''s New England, and he would likely
  have been familiar with them, especially given his voracious curiosity for visual
  ephemera.'
