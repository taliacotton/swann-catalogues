TYPESET: <p>Includes costume designs for New York City Ballet productions "Dances
  at a Gathering" and "The Goldberg Variations" 1969-1971. The group comprises over
  60 illustrations, from rough to finished, many with his manuscript notes, in a number
  of media including graphite, ink, watercolor, chalk, and color pencil. Some contain
  fabric swatches pinned to production notes and sketches. Sizes vary, but many most
  on 8x10-inch or 9x12-inch sheets or larger, many are cut from those or larger sheets;
  the majority (roughly 40) are laid into the sleeves of a ring binder; 13 are mounted
  to display boards and shrink-wrapped with display mounting hooks on verso.<br><br>Eula's
  long and prolific career in fashion and performing arts began in the 1950s where,
  after serving in the Italian Campaign in World War II and completing studies at
  The Art Students League on the GI Bill, he was launched into the fashion world as
  the head illustrator for <em>The New York Herald Tribune</em> under Eugenia Sheppard.
  Soon to follow were positions at <em>The London Sunday Times, American Vogue, The
  New York Times,</em> and Italian <em>Harper's Bazaar</em> where he famously covered
  Yves Saint Laurent's first and last collections (1958 and 2002). However, it is
  as Halston's Creative Director throughout the 1970s that he is best remembered.
  That time was recently chronicled in the popular Netflix series "Halston" in which
  Eula is skillfully portrayed by actor David Pittu.<br></p><p>Eula made considerable
  contributions to the world of dance and theater; these detailed, thoughtful designs
  for Robbins' masterworks, for which he designed both sets and costumes, exemplify
  his genius for line, color, and form.</p>
