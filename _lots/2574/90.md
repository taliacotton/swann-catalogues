TYPESET: "Group of 44 original drawings, sketches, studies and notes for the book by Walter Hoving (New York: Washburn, 1961) illustrated by Eula. Pen, ink, graphite, and wash on rectangular white paper and onion skin. Includes both unused studies and published images. Sizes vary, mostly 380x254 mm; 15x10 inches. One 19x16-inch captioned illustration (not in book) is framed. A 1979 Japanese edition of the book accompanies the lot. <br><br>Celebrating its sixtieth anniversary this year, this charming and wry etiquette guide for adolescents shows Eula's playful side. It was reprinted for its 50th anniversary and remains collectible. <br><br>Eula's long and prolific career in fashion and performing arts began in the 1950s where, after serving in the Italian Campaign in World War II, and completing studies at The Art Students League on the GI Bill, he was launched into the fashion world as the head illustrator for <i>The New York Herald Tribune</i> under Eugenia Sheppard. Soon to follow were positions at <i>The London Sunday Times, American Vogue, The New York Times,</i> and Italian <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> where he famously covered Yves Saint Laurent's first and last collections (1958 and 2002). However, it is as Halston's Creative Director throughout the 1970s that he is best remembered. That time was recently chronicled in the popular Netflix series \"Halston\" in which Eula is skilfully portrayed by actor David Pittu who was nominated for a Tony Award for the role."
