TYPESET: '<p>Cover illustration for the first paperback edition of <em>The Dark Half</em>
  by Stephen King (New York: Signet, 1990). Primarily airbrush with liquid acrylic
  finished with Krylon artist spray fixative on board. 505x405 mm; 20x16 inches. Signed
  "D. Brautigam" in lower left image. <br><br>Provenance: Estate of the artist. <br><br>One
  of Brautigam''s most recognized Stephen King covers. Applying intense red paint
  to two birds whose profiles form a pair of seeking eyes, he perfectly depicts the
  book''s ominous premonition "The sparrows are flying again" for the tale which plays
  with the concept of two halves forming a whole. <br><br>Brautigam was a highly skilled
  illustrator who pioneered the use of black paint against striking colors to create
  some of the most iconic heavy metal album covers and thriller/horror genre book
  covers throughout the 1980s and 90s. Among his most famous are the 1986 Metallica
  album <em>Master of Puppets</em>, Mötley Crüe''s 1989 album <em>Dr. Feelgood,</em>
  and numerous covers for the wildly popular Signet paperbacks of Stephen King novels
  including <em>The Stand</em> and <em>The Dark Half.</em></p>'
