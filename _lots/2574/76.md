TYPESET: "Cover illustration for the first paperback edition of <i>The Dark Half</i> by Stephen King (New York: Signet, 1990). Primarily airbrush with liquid acrylic finished with Krylon artist spray fixative on board. 505x405 mm; 20x16 inches. Signed \"D. Brautigam\" in lower left image. <br><br>Provenance: Estate of the artist. <br><br>One of Brautigam's most recognized Stephen King covers. Applying intense red paint to two birds whose profiles form a pair of seeking eyes, he perfectly depicts the book's ominous premonition \"The sparrows are flying again\" for the tale which plays with the concept of two halves forming a whole. <br><br>Brautigam was a highly skilled illustrator who pioneered the use of black paint against striking colors to create some of the most iconic heavy metal album covers and thriller/horror genre book covers throughout the 1980s and 90s. Among his most famous are the1986 Metallica album <i>Master of Puppets</i>, Mötley Crüe's 1989 album <i>Dr. Feelgood,</i> and numerous covers for the wildly popular Signet paperbacks of Stephen King novels including <i>The Stand</i> and <i>The Dark Half.</i>"
