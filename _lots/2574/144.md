  of the charitable association founded in 1926 and still active today. The group’s
  name serves as a metaphor, with the members, due to their human imperfections, representing
  “sinners,” who strive to be “saints” of mercy by helping those in need. The club’s
  origins date back to 1926 when a small group of circus enthusiasts in New York City
  founded the Circus Fans Association of America, providing aid to retired circus
  performers in need of financial assistance. In 1929, several members resigned and
  formed the Circus Saints and Sinners Club of America. Over the decades, they have
  evolved into a modern, nonprofit philanthropic organization. <br><br>Steinke was
  an accomplished American painter, portraitist, illustrator, graphic designer and
  muralist. Early in her career, she worked for the National Broadcasting Company
  where she painted portraits of the NBC Orchestra including Arturo Toscanini and
  Ignace Paderewski, now both in the permanent collection of the National Portrait
  Gallery in Washington, D.C.. During World War II, she worked for the U.S. War Department,
  painting the portraits of major American figures such as Franklin D. Roosevelt,
  Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Generals Henry "Hap" Arnold and Douglas MacArthur. She
  was given the John Singer Sargent Award for Lifetime Achievement by the Society
  of Portrait Artists and honored by the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and National
  Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum for her work featuring American Indians and the
  West to which she devoted the later decades of her life.
