  was created in the late 1970s or early `80s. Sharing a background in newspapers
  and a penchant for colorful characters, Hirschfeld and Runyon occupied the same
  world. Over the decades, he created several drawings based on his literary and film
  works including <i>Guys and Dolls, A Pocketful of Miracles</i> and <i>Little Miss
  Marker.</i>
