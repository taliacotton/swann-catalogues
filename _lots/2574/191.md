LOT: "191"

REFNO: "783209"
TYPESET: 26 original scenic concept designs for the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical
  that premiered at The St. James Theatre May 1, 1983.  Collage, colorade paper, and
  photographic reproduction. 216x254 mm; 8½x10 inches, mounted to 14x17-inch sheets.
  Laid into artist's signed board portfolio case. <br><br><i>My One and Only</i> was
  the breakthrough production for Lobel, the award-winning American scenic designer
  and producer for theatre, opera, and dance, and a fine artist. <br>Her bright, graphic
  sets based upon Russian Constructivist art perfectly set the stage for the hit musical
  starring Tommy Tune and Twiggy, based on the book by Peter Stone and Timothy S.
  Mayer and featuring music and lyrics by the Gershwin brothers. <br>The show's road
  to success was fraught with controversy, having suffered difficult out-of-town tryouts
  in Boston which resulted in most of the original creative team being fired, including
  its original director, Peter Sellars, along with Tim Mayer, the musical director
  and arranger, and Lobel. While Tommy Tune nominally took over the direction with
  his co-director / -choreographer Thommie Walsh, Lobel's contribution was deemed
  too integral to the production and her work was kept largely unaltered. The show
  became one of the most celebrated musicals of the decade and ran for 767 performances
  through March 3, 1985. <br><br>Lobel has designed sets for Broadway, off-Broadway,
  and metropolitan and regional theater productions worldwide, including the Metropolitan
  Opera, Le Chatelet, The Royal National Theater, BAM, the Yale Repertory Theatre,
  Théatre Royal de la Monnai, New York City Opera, SUNY Purchase, and Central Park's
  Delacorte Theater.  Her prolific work for the Mark Morris Dance Group is widely
  acclaimed. Many of her stage maquettes and designs are housed in the permanent collection
  of the McNay Art Museum, San Antonio, Texas, including those for the Houston Grand
  Opera productions of "Nixon in China" and "Street Scene." In 2002 she produced and
  was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical for "A Year With Frog and Toad"
  based upon the famous children's books by her late father, Arnold Lobel, whom she
  credits for instilling much of her work ethic and love of art.
