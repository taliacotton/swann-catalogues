TYPESET: 'Postcard design created by Gorey for the purpose of replying to fan mail,
  1979. Pen and ink with dashes of correction fluid on paper. 158x108 mm; 6¼x4¼ inches,
  on 11½x7¼-inch sheet. Unsigned (as Gorey would sign his name across the diagonal
  band before sending), but measurement, trim marks, and dated "?ix.79 - I.c.79" inked
  in lower right corner. <br><br>Provenance: Archives of the printer, Oliphant Press.
  <br><br>Gorey was slightly reluctant about his popularity which was already growing
  steadily by the 1980s. To assuage his guilt at not being able to answer the growing
  influx of fan mail, he created this response postcard which he had printed, would
  hand sign within its fancy banner, and mail back to the sender. It contained his
  favorite tropes: a languid cat sitting upon a Japanese urn of letters overflowing
  onto a patterned carpet (both camouflaged by the elaborate wallpaper), and drapery
  with tassels. A voice bubble above the cat delivers the contrite-yet-candid message:
  “You’ve written me to no avail, Because I never read my mail.”<br><br>As part of
  the Edward Gorey Documentary Project directed by Christopher Seufert, the artist
  himself was interviewed on the subject of fan mail. '
