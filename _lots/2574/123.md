  <br><br>Provenance: Kenneth Marshall; gift of the artist to friend Kenneth Maples;
  private collection, San Antonio, Texas. <br><br>A thoroughly charming sketchbook
  by beloved children''s book author and creator of the famous "George and Martha"
  series of books about the friendship and adventures of a witty hippopotamus couple.
  <br><br>Created for a close friend from his early years in San Antonio, presumably
  before Marshall planned a trip to Europe, the humorous drawings feature scenes in
  classic Boston area locations including the MFA, New England Conservatory, Locke-Ober,
  Gainsboro Street, The Bar of the Other Side on Charles Street, Hayes-Bickford''s,
  The English Tea Room, Newbury Street, and Aladdin''s Cave. Some drawings include
  his bulldog Irene (whom he often featured in his books), two self-portraits, and
  other curious animals and characters whose physical details nod to the style and
  types he would develop in his later work. <br>Marshall attended The New England
  Conservatory of Music where he studied viola until a nerve damage in his hand caused
  him to leave. Not long after switching studies and graduating from Southern Connecticut
  State College in 1967, he began working as a freelance author and illustrator, and
  his first book for children, "Plink, Plink, Plink" by Byrd Baylor was published
  in 1970. Although he had no formal art training, Marshall illustrated more than
  70 books before he died at the early age of 50 from AIDS-related causes. In 2007
  the American Library Association posthumously awarded him the Laura Ingalls Wilder
  Medal for a "substantial and lasting contribution" to American children''s literature.</p>'
