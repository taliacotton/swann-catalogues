  December 23, 1968, where it was originally titled "Beat the Queen." <em>Sports Illustrated</em>
  began publication in 1954, but the nascent magazine struggled to find an audience
  and operated at a loss for several years. In order to attract broader readership
  in the early days, the magazine reported on non-mainstream sports and occasionally
  ran a work of fiction. "Beat the Queen" is likely one of the only stories for children
  to be published in <em>Sports Illustrated</em>. <br><br>See artist''s bio above
