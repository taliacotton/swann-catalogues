  the lot. <br><br>A selection of these illustrations by Pène du Bois first appeared
  in the story''s initial publication in <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, December 23, 1968,
  where it was originally titled "Beat the Queen." <i>Sports Illustrated</i> began
  publication in 1954, but the nascent magazine struggled to find an audience and
  operated at a loss for several years. In order to attract broader readership in
  the early days, the magazine reported on non-mainstream sports and occasionally
  ran a work of fiction. "Beat the Queen" is likely one of the only stories for children
  to be published in <i>Sports Illustrated</i>. <br><br>Pène du Bois'' whimsical illustrations
  and beloved cast of characters made serious themes accessible and engaging for children.
  The American author and illustrator is among a select few who have been presented
  with both a Newbery Medal (for <i>The Twenty-One Balloons</i>, 1947) and Caldecott
  Honors (for <i>Bear Party</i>, 1951 and <i>Lion</i>, 1956). As both artist and author,
  Pène du Bois captivated generations of readers with his unique combination of humor
  and imagination.'
