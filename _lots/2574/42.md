  current owner from Storyopolis, April 2006. <br><br>In his third children''s book,
  award-winning actor and best-selling author John Lithgow tells the tale of Micawber,
  a creative squirrel who lives in the Central Park Carousel and is a frequent visitor
  to the neighboring Metropolitan Museum of Art. One day as he peers through the window,
  he observes an artist in the gallery copying the old masters. Inspired and eager
  to try it himself, Micawber leaps into the artist''s paint box as she leaves the
  Museum and hides in the apartment until she falls asleep. Borrowing the paints and
  using the tip of his bushy tail as a brush, Micawber surreptitiously discovers the
  joy of painting his own masterpieces. </p><p>Night after night, he returns to the
  artist''s apartment to paint. At dawn, he rolls up his canvas, ties it with a shoelace,
  and heads home to the park. Eventually, he has enough of his own paintings to open
  "Micawber''s Museum of Art" in his living room at the top of the carousel, where
  he invites his fellow creatures of Central Park to admire his creations. In this
  illustration, Micawber imitates Norman Rockwell''s iconic <em>Triple self-portrait</em>.<br><br>C.
  F. Payne illustrated Lithgow''s <em>The Remarkable Farkle McBride</em> in addition
  to other books for children. His illustrations have regularly appeared in <em>The
  Atlantic Monthly</em> and <em>Time</em>.</p>'
