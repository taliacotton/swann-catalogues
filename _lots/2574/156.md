TYPESET: 'Together, group of 15 possible poster maquettes, circa 1950. Acrylic on
  board, some with added metallic paint. Most are 306x152 mm; 12x6 inches. <i>"Chief
  Short Horn"</i> is 285x213 mm; 11¼x8¼ inches, on 12x9-inch board. <i>"The Marvelous
  Pig Lady of London" is</i> initialed "S. H." (or possibly "S. K.") in graphite on
  verso; the remaining are unsigned. <br><br>The exact purpose of these illustrations
  is unknown, as some represent real acts in circuses and sideshows at various points
  in history. They are executed in the vibrant cartoonish style of the famed banner
  artist David C. "Snapp" Wyatt who painted advertisements for circus and sideshow
  acts in the mid-twentieth century. The grouping features typical acts like sword-swallowers
  and lion tamers often found in modern circuses, as well as so-called attractions
  that are now considered taboo for the entertainment industry, but which once formed
  the basis of "freak shows," such as humans with physical aberrations and cultural
  groups once considered to be exotic in their appearance. <br><br>The group includes:
  "La Tena''s Trained Wild Animals," "The Lion King," "Unis," "Capt. Cutter Knife
  Artiste/Zarov Fire Eater," "El''Toro Crocodile Wrestler/Bingo the Human Chimp,"
  "Lentini 3-Legged Man," "The Siamese Twins Chang and Eng," "The Albino Family,"
  "The Marvelous Pig Lady of London," "Fiji Island Mermaid: Captured Alive," "Malaka
  and her Serpents/Two-Headed Girl," "Pygmy Tribe/Zelda the Half Girl," "Giraffe-Neck
  Women from Burma," "Ubangi Savages: Africa/Capture of the Horned Men," and "Chief
  Short Horn: Terror of the West."'
