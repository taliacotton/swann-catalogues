  childhood, encouraged by his grandmother, who fashioned an indoor hockey goal beneath
  the basement steps of their Minnesota home and offered Charles a broom to serve
  as a stick. </p><p>From the Schulz Museum website: "After Charles Schulz moved to
  sunny California in 1958, he began to miss his time on the ice. While there were
  several ice rinks in Northern California at the time, there was only one in Sonoma
  County. By the end of the 1960s, that rink had to be closed due to structural issues
  and so Schulz and his family had a new ice rink built in the newly developed northwest
  neighborhood of Santa Rosa. They opened the rink to the public in 1969 and called
  it the Redwood Empire Ice Arena, designing it with a Swiss Alps village theme to
  make it one of the prettiest ice rinks in the world.</p><p>At the Redwood Empire
  Ice Arena, Schulz would play in a “pick-up” game each Tuesday night with his sons,
  Monte and Craig, and hockey players from the local community. Charles Schulz supported
  the growth of youth hockey groups and local figure skating clubs, served as a referee,
  and in 1975 he established Snoopy’s Senior Hockey Tournament. This tournament allowed
  players aged 40 and over to come to Santa Rosa each summer and play others in their
  age groups. Schulz belonged to the Diamond Icers team, wearing jersey number 9.
  &lt;QL&gt;&lt;QL&gt;The Redwood Empire Ice Arena or `Snoopy’s Home Ice'' is still
  going strong and Snoopy’s Senior Hockey Tournament is still held every July. It
  continues to be a favorite with participants, and those observing from the stands,
  attracting many former National Hockey League players and teams from around the
  world including Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and
  even Australia."</p><p>Skating-themed Peanuts cartoons remain among the most desirable
  for collectors.</p>'
