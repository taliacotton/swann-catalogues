  <br><br>Jill DeGroff is a fine artist and sought-after caricaturist of the craft
  cocktail era with a passionate cult following. Inspired by Al Hirschfeldâ€™s illustrations
  of speakeasies in his 1932 book <em>Manhattan Oases,</em> she began painting and
  sketching in bars and jazz clubs over two decades ago, often accompanying her husband,
  Dale DeGroff, the James Beard award-winning mixologist and author of <em>The Craft
  of the Cocktail</em> (and its recent update <em>The New Craft of the Cocktail</em>)
  and with whom she co-founded the Museum of the American Cocktail in New Orleans
  in 2004. Her book, <em>Lush Life Portraits from the Bar,</em> (New York, 2009) is
  an anthology of the colorful characters she met in bars around the world and the
  tales they told. <br><br>This painting captures the spirit of the legendary speakeasy-turned-landmark
  restaurant that opened its doors at 21 West 52nd Street in 1929 and was famous for
  its 35 colorful jockey sculptures that lined its entrance. One of the city's most
  celebrated hot spots of the pre- and post-Prohibition eras, its regulars included
  Ernest Hemingway, Mae West, Mayor Jimmy Walker, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Crawford,
  and was a must-visit stop for every presidential candidate beginning with FDR. <br>
  During Prohibition, it was equipped with an elaborate system of levers that were
  used to tip the shelves of the bar, sweeping the liquor bottles through a chute
  leading into the city's sewers and reserved a private bar in the basement for Mayor
  Walker that included a secret wine cellar accessible only through a hidden door
  disguised as a brick wall that opened into the basement of the adjacent building.
  Though closed indefinitely during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, its current owners,
  the French luxury firm conglomerate LVMH, announced they are planning to reopen
  "21" at some point in a new, reimagined form with a nod to its distinctive past.</p>
