  <br><br>See artist's bio above.<br><br>This painting captures the spirit of the
  legendary speakeasy-turned-landmark restaurant that opened its doors at 21 West
  52nd Street in 1929 and was famous for its 35 colorful jockey sculptures that lined
  its entrance. One of the city's most celebrated hot spots of the pre- and post-Prohibition
  eras, its regulars included Ernest Hemingway, Mae West, Mayor Jimmy Walker, Elizabeth
  Taylor, Joan Crawford, and was a must-visit stop for every presidential candidate
  beginning with FDR. <br> During Prohibition, it was equipped with an elaborate system
  of levers that were used to tip the shelves of the bar, sweeping the liquor bottles
  through a chute leading into the city's sewers and reserved a private bar in the
  basement for Mayor Walker that included a secret wine cellar accessible only through
  a hidden door disguised as a brick wall that opened into the basement of the adjacent
  building. Though closed indefinitely during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, its current
  owners, the French luxury firm conglomerate LVMH, announced they are planning to
  reopen "21" at some point in a new, reimagined form with a nod to its distinctive
  past.</p>
