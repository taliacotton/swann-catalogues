  County/for Meritorious Service in the War Bond Program."<br><br>Exhibited: ACA Galleries
  and Associated American Artists.</p><p>Born in New York City into a family of Jewish
  immigrants, Gropper is best known for satirical cartoons and images about war, politics,
  and social injustice. He began his career with the <em>New York Tribune</em> and
  published in mainstream magazines like <em>Vanity Fair</em>, but he also contributed
  to more radical left-wing magazines, including <em>The Masses</em> and <em>Liberator</em>,
  and Communist publications, such as <em>Freiheit</em> and the <em>Daily Worker</em>.
  Though Gropper was later branded a Communist and was blacklisted in the post-war
  McCarthy era, this did not deter the artist from continuing to create satirical
  images that revealed his political and social views which conservatives deemed radical.</p><p>This
  large maquette for a well-known Liberty Loan poster reflects Gropper''s dedication
  to raising opposition to fascism in Europe in the late 1930s and early 1940s.</p>'
