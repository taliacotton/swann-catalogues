FOOTNOTE: "These seven men went to England as part of a travelling show managed by the firm of Storrs & Co. of Buffalo, NY. They were all Senecas from Buffalo Creek, and arrived in Liverpool in January 1818, and toured at least through may--one of the first such Indian shows to hit Europe. Pictured are: Beaver, I Like Her, Two Guns, Steep Rock, Black Squirrel, Long Horns, and Little Bear. See the Hampshire Telegraph, 4 May 1818; and \"The Indian Show of Storrs & Co.\" in Publications of the Buffalo Historical Society IV (1896), pages 415-6. The artist was a favorite of the Prince of Wales and was best known for his views of the Waterloo battlefield. <br><br>One listed in OCLC, at Yale. Another uncolored copy held by the Six Nations Public Library in Ontario names the printer and date in pencil. One traced at auction, in 2015."
