FOOTNOTE: "An allegorical celebration of the treaty which ended the War of 1812. A lengthy caption explains that \"Minerva represents the wisdom of the United States\" and \"dictates the conditions of peace.\" An obelisk bears the names of the nation's principal military leaders (including future presidents Jackson and Harrison) and the key battles of the war. The ruins of the Capitol can be seen in the background. The artist Julia Plantou (1778-1853) was a French-born woman described here as \"Citizen of the United Stades, pinxit.\" She exhibited the original canvas at her home in 1818, a date which accords with a caption inset listing of the first 20 states through Mississippi (admitted late in 1817) One in OCLC (Library of Congress), and just one other traced at auction since 1912."
