FOOTNOTE: "You may have read the poignant farewell orders of General Grant or Lee to their troops at the conclusion of the war. Here is a much more obscure farewell order, issued by the commander of Battery D of the 1st New York Artillery, James B. Hazelton. It is numbered as Company Order No. 19, but is manuscript rather than printed. Were these hand-copied for each battery member by the adjutant, or was this a transcript made shortly after the war? In either case, we find no other example, in manuscript or print. <br><br>\"By your conduct upon many hard-fought fields, you have won for yourselves a reputation which will live in history. You will ever receive from our people constant esteem and gratitude. . . . As happiness attends each one of you in life, do not forget to at times devote a few moments and water afresh with sacred tears the memory of those who have so nobly fallen from your midst.\""
