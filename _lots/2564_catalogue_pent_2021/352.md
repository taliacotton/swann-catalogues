This second edition is substantially expanded and revised, representing the final and most complete edition issued during Heredia's short lifetime. <br><br>This volume collates with the copy at the Biblioteca Nacional de España; we find no other collations. Palau 113262n. 4 institutional holdings in OCLC. We trace no other examples of the first or second editions at auction since Swann's Hispanic Society sale on 30 November 1961, lot 230.
