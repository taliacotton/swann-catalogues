FOOTNOTE: "A committee composed mostly of Confederate enlisted men drafted these resolutions of patriotism in the wake of the failed Hampton Roads peace conference of 3 February 1865. They resolve to continue \"the maintenance of this struggle for independence, . . . determined to contest until the bitter end.\" They describe the Union army as \"a crafty, cruel and merciless foe . . . were he to come with the Bible in one hand, we would look for the dagger in the other.\" They join with President Davis in rejection of the peace terms, and place their faith in \"the great and glorious Lee--the Christian gentleman and chivalrous soldier\" to \"eventually lead us forth to victory, honor and liberty.\" The resolutions close with a postscript which urges that they be published--\"when you present them to Congress, please say that they were adopted near a month ago.\" The minutes of the Confederate House of Representatives for 28 February 1865 note the receipt of \"certain patriotic resolutions, adopted some time since by Forsberg's Brigade, of Wharton's Division. Laid upon the table and ordered to be printed.\" Parrish & Willingham 1598."
