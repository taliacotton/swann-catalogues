FOOTNOTE: 12 of these images are albumen photographs credited to the well-known Mexican
  photographer Abel Briquet, either in the printed caption slip, signed in the negative,
  or both. Briquet was born in France and became one of Mexico's first well-known
  commercial photographers. Most of these images are landscapes from his "Vistas,
  Mexicanas" series including the cathedral and national palace in Mexico City, the
  tomb of Juarez, three of the Chapultepec castle and its forest, and two ranch scenes
  from the scenic mountain town of Amecameca. Also included are two figures in traditional
  dress headed "Tipos, Mexicanos, Estado de Mexico" and another headed "Antiguedades,
  Mexicanas, Piedra de los Sacrificios, Museo Nacional de Mexico." One final uncredited
  Mexican photograph shows the city of Zacatecas from a distance. Finally, at the
  end of the volume is a cyanotype photograph of an imposing urban residence--we suspect
  the compiler's home in Memphis. <br><br>The compiler was William Horatio Bates (1841-1918)
  of Memphis, TN, president of S.C. Toof & Company, Printers, Lithographers, and Binders,
  the firm which not coincidentally also produced this handsome custom binding. The
  Memphis Daily Commercial of 31 March 1890 reports on the return of Bates from a
  business trip to Mexico, where he attended a bullfight and was "treated to all interesting
  sights peculiar to the region and the mercurial people of their tropical land, exotic
  vegetation and erotic individuality."
