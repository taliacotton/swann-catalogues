FOOTNOTE: "First edition of a colorful classic biography of the Texas frontiersman, written by a close lifelong friend. The first 158 pages are devoted to hunting and Indian fighting. Pages 159-228 describe his role in the 1842 Mier Expedition by a Texas militia against Mexico, including his capture, survival of the Black Bean episode, and long imprisonment at Perote. The final 7 chapters are an uproarious and perhaps not 100% reliable account of Wallace's trip to Virginia via New Orleans. \"His narrative . . . is the rollickiest and most flavorsome that any American frontiersman has yet inspired\"--Dobie, page 55. Clark, New South I-65; Graff 1187; Howes D602 (\"aa\"); Jenkins, Basic Texas Books 50."
