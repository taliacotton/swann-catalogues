FOOTNOTE: "Clarence David Mackenzie (1849-1861) of Brooklyn enlisted in the 13th New York Infantry as a drummer at the tender age of 12. While the regiment was still in training in Annapolis, MD, he was killed in his tent by a stray practice bullet--Brooklyn's first casualty of the war. A poignant zinc sculptural monument of him can still be seen in Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery, bearing the title \"Our Drummer Boy.\" <br><br>This studio photograph shows Mackenzie beside his \"13th\" drum, in uniform with his Company D belt buckle. At least two period engravings were made from this photograph, including as a frontispiece to an 1861 chapbook, \"The Little Drummer Boy, Clarence D. McKenzie\"; an undated magazine clipping of the other engraving is included with the lot."
