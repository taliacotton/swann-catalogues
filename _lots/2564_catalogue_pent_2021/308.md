FOOTNOTE: "In 1887, the Glens Falls Breeders Association began harness racing on a half-mile track in Glens Falls, NY. The Northern New York Trotting Horse Breeders Association was formed in 1889 and took over the operation. A new full mile track was opened in 1893. For several years it was very prominent on the national racing Grand Circuit. A speed record was set there on 10 September 1896 between the horses John R. Gentry and Star Pointer. <br>This lot includes some or all of the N.N.Y.T.H.B.A.'s race records for each year of its existence from 1889 through October 1902, as recorded in pre-printed log books of the National Trotting Association. These are the \"Member's Books,\" manuscript copies of the official judge's books, transcribed at year's end for each of the association's members. John R. Gentry's record-setting 2:01½-minute performance, national news for racing fans at the time, is recorded on page 24 of the 1896 volume. Not included is the association's aborted 1903 season, which was postponed until 20 July. The track was sold at a foreclosure sale two days later, bringing its racing to a close."
