FOOTNOTE: "Some or all of these photographs show soldiers and scenery at Fort D.A. Russell in southeastern Wyoming (now Warren Air Force Base). One shows a soldier standing by a bicycle with a mail bag attached--possibly a member of the 25th Infantry Bicycle Corps, a short-lived Buffalo Soldier unit which experimented with mail delivery across great distances from 1896 to 1898. Other photographs show military wagon trains, two soldiers holding freshly killed rabbit and turkeys, and views of military tent encampments. <br><br>4 of the photographs have manuscript captions on verso, 3 of them identifying the scene as Fort D.A. Russell, and the other reading \"Officer's Quarters . . . Ft. D.A. Russell, Wyo. Photo taken by Mr. Henry C. Langdon, Sept. 18 1897. Prof. J.O. Churchill of Cheyenne and his two children are standing on the sidewalk, Lieut. R.C. Langdon, 8th Inf. standing on their right. They are all in front of Quarters No. 27 occupied by Lt. Langdon.\" Russell Creamer Langdon (1873-1962) was a recent West Point graduate who eventually gained the rank of Brigadier General. The photographer is credited twice in manuscript as Henry C. Langdon (1847-1930), a Nebraska railroad engineer and uncle of the young Lieutenant Langdon."
