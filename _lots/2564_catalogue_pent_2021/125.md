FOOTNOTE: "Robert H. Pettigrew (1788-1841) of Savannah discusses the unsettled situation in Alabama as the local Creeks faced removal in the Creek War of 1836: \"I am very desirous to visit you . . . but the unsettled state of the Indian country rather deters me. . . . I wrote to father & mother some weeks since but have received no answer. This renews my apprehension that the intercourse is not free or safe. I conversed with some wagoners from the Chattahoochee & they said travellers through the Creek country was not safe.\" <br><br>Pettigrew also announces with relief that he has \"lost no lives among my negroes\" during a recent hurricane. He considers selling his plantation and moving west: \"Your land and Negroes must follow the price of cotton, that is very low. The papers give frequently an account of Negroes selling for 300 dollars. . . . I could put fifteen or twenty hands in the field and a certainty of revenue . . . would make me very comfortable.\""
