FOOTNOTE: "The Clinton Light Guards were a militia unit in Clinton, MA near Worcester. In early March, the town was the first in the state to make an appropriation to send them to the front, in expectation of war. However, the company languished in training camp before being allowed to join the 15th Massachusetts Infantry as Company C. Offered here is the speaking program for their departure ceremony, featuring hymns and sermons by 4 local ministers. Although the Light Guards missed the disaster at Bull Run, the regiment suffered heavy losses at Antietam and Gettysburg, and is credited with the 10th-highest fatality rate among all Union regiments. No other examples of this program are traced at auction or in OCLC."
