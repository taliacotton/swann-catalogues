FOOTNOTE: "The composition was likely inspired by Benjamin West's much-loved 1770 painting \"The Death of General Wolfe,\" set at the 1759 Battle of Quebec. Wolfe's French counterpart Montcalm also suffered a mortal injury that day. While West's painting took a few liberties with the historical facts, this one goes a bit farther, as Montcalm had been badly wounded on the retreat from the Plains of Abraham, but made it back within the city walls on horseback and did not die until the next morning. Palm trees are also notably in short supply in Quebec."
