FOOTNOTE: "The pages of this notebook are filled with art, which grows increasingly bizarre: a pentagrammed hat over a broom titled \"Witchcraft\" (page 81); Jesus on the cross captioned \"Names, Magii, Magic, wisdom or wisemen, the same who found Christ\" (106); a suite of drawings of circus freaks including Siamese twins, Elephant Boy, a legless horse and a sword swallower (pages 110-119); gartered legs and women's heads which appear to be intended as tattoo art (129); the psychedelic masterwork, \"Ancient Mode of Worship\" (134); a virgin having her heart ripped out with a sword in a Mexican occult ceremony (136); dozens of souls being burned inside a demonic creature called \"Wicker Man . . . in time of druids in England\" (137); and finally two pages of tortures inspired by the Spanish Inquisition (138-9). <br><br>The drawings are interspersed with occasional textual passages. An incoherent manuscript note reads \"What has and does rule the world: mesmerism, clariavoiancy, hynatism, fire, fear, farce, and the mighty gold dollar.\" 6 pages are devoted to horoscopes (122-6). Among the more staid artistic compositions (most of them earlier in the volume) are a sign for the artist's father's (imaginary?) business, \"Deerfield Farm, O.D. Philbrick & Sons\"; a full-page landscape featuring the school in Hudson, NH; three fire engines titled \"Philbrick Fire Co.\"; a crowded car on the Nashua & Lowell Rail Road; a Jewish junk dealer; men in military uniforms; an \"American school teacher\"; a naval vessel titled the USS Maybrick; Masonic emblems; Black Heart, chief of the Apaches; and a whaling scene. <br><br>Two names appear repeatedly throughout this album. The main artist appears to be Ren W. Philbrick (1888-1953). Philbrick was aged about 16 when he made these drawings. His father Orrin D. Philbrick was a teamster and farm laborer. Ren would be married by 1910 and never had children, working on odd jobs ranging from farm laborer to railroad shop repairman to brush burner on a reforestation project. The other name which appears repeatedly in the album is Charles H.F. Daigneault, which appears completely untraceable, though Daigneault is a fairly common French-Canadian surname in northern New England. It may well have been a fictional persona adopted by Philbrick."
