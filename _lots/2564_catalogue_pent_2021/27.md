FOOTNOTE: "While a distraught Englishman wrings his hands and a British lion sleeps, a cow representing British commerce is being exploited by its enemies. An American saws off one of its horns, it is milked by a Dutchman, and a Frenchman and a Spaniard stand by with bowls of milk. Philadelphia looms in the background. This composition initially appeared in Westminster Magazine in February 1778, and was frequently re-engraved in this period. The present version was issued without a date or credit line, but has a lengthy caption in French beginning \"La Vache a Lait, Représente le Commerce de la Grande-Bretagne.\" It can be distinguished by other versions by the tears in the Englishman's eyes. Cresswell 781a."
