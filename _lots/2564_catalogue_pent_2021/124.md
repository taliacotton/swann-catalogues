FOOTNOTE: "A previously unknown printing of the disastrous Treaty of New Echota of 29 December 1835, in which an unauthorized minority faction of the Cherokee Nation agreed upon removal west to Indian Territory and cleared the path for the Trail of Tears. The treaty was signed in northwestern Georgia, but it also affected Cherokees living in Tennessee and Alabama. This copy was printed by order of the Tennessee House of Representatives. It includes the supplementary articles signed into law by Andrew Jackson on 23 May 1836. We trace no other existing copies of this printing in OCLC or elsewhere; it is not recorded in the 1942 Checklist of Tennessee Imprints. <br><br>Provenance: issued to Thomas Kennedy Gordon (1792-1880), then serving in the Tennessee House of Representatives for Giles County, who had served as captain under Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812 and became a life-long friend; consigned by Gordon's great-great-granddaughter."
