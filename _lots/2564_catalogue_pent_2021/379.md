FOOTNOTE: "The English titles are \"Mexico: Bird's Eye View Looking Towards the West\" and \"Mexico: View of the Great Square and Cathedral,\" with alternate titles in Spanish. These prints were issued as a pair. They are discussed in the October 1826 issue of La Belle Assembl√©e Magazine, page 183: \"The idea which they convey is very fresh and vivid; they have all the appearance of accuracy.\" We trace no other examples at auction, although Maggs offered the Great Square view at retail in 1939. OCLC lists only one example of the bird's eye view, at the British Library, and none of the Great Square."
