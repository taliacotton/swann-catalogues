FOOTNOTE: "This document was issued just 4 days after the Continental Army left Valley Forge in pursuit of the British toward Manhattan. Just 6 days later, the two armies met in the Battle of Monmouth. It lists 16 \"Brigades of the Grand Army\" plus the \"Staff Department,\" and the appointed \"Receivers of Cattle\" for each brigade. After a lean six months in camp, they may have encountered improved forage opportunities on the march, and welcomed a fresh supply of beef in their provisions. The 16 brigades listed here were all among the 18 which spent the spring at Valley Forge. Maxwell's New Jersey Brigade had left Valley Forge the previous month and is not listed here. The 3rd Pennsylvania Brigade is not listed here for some reason, and the 1st and 2nd Pennsylvania Brigades had no appointed receiver of cattle--no beef for them. Among the listed brigade commanders are Varnum, Muhlenberg, Varnum and Knox."
