FOOTNOTE: "This scarce print was lithographed and \"printed in oil colors\" by P.S. Duval & Son, \"from the original in the possession of J.P. McKean\" of Washington, DC, who is also credited as the publisher and copyright holder. The original painting is described in Morgan & Fielding's \"Life Portraits of Washington\" as #7 by Joseph Wright (page 78 and plate facing page 80), which was purchased at auction in Alexandria, VA in 1815 by Thomas Shields. James P. McKean (1805-1882), listed here as the owner of the painting, was the son-in-law of Shields. The painting was later sold by the McKeans to the Cleveland Museum of Art. This print is not in Hart or in OCLC; we trace only one other at auction since 1910."
