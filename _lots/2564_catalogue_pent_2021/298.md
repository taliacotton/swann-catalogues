FOOTNOTE: "The 1876 election in South Carolina was marked by widespread violence and voter intimidation by white supremacist \"rifle clubs\" and resulted in two governors claiming victory: the incumbent Republican Daniel Chamberlain, backed by the federal government and its military, and Democrat Wade Hampton III, an ex-Confederate Lieutenant General. The contested presidential election was decided in favor of Republicans, but with a compromise agreement to withdraw federal troops from the South. When the troops left, Governor Chamberlain left, and General Hampton was free to start planning his inauguration. This invitation lists the dozens of managers on his inauguration committee."
