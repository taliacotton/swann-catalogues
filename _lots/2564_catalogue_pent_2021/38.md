FOOTNOTE: "One of the first engraved portraits of Washington ever produced, said to be after the wholly imaginary artist \"Alex'r Campbell of Williamsburgh in Virginia,\" for a European audience eager to see the face of the new revolution. It depicts him on horseback with a drawn sword as his troops repel a British charge in the background. A copy of this print was sent to the Washingtons a few months later. General Washington replied politely, describing the subject of this print in the third person: \"Mr. Campbell, whom I never saw to my knowledge, has made a very formidable figure of the Commander-in-Chief, giving him a sufficient portion of terror in his countenance\"--Morgan & Fielding 53. Fowble 75; Hart 721."
