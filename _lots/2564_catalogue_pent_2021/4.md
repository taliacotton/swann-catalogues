Other important American trade products such as palm trees, hammocks and crocodiles are depicted. It is captioned with an original bit of verse: \"America! of Wealth thou modern Mine / What if by conquest we possess thy Shore / Thy Savages reveng'd should less repine / Since we're the Slaves of thy corrupting Ore.\" Sayer issued other prints with the \"Fetter Lane, opposite Fleet Street\" imprint from at least 1748 onward; this series was listed in his 1766 sale catalog."
