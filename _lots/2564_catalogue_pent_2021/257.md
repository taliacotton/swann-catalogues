FOOTNOTE: "In 1836, Joseph Smith decided that the Saints required knowledge of Hebrew to advance their theological studies. They brought the Hebrew scholar Joshua Seixas to Kirtland to give daily lessons to a group of more than thirty, including Smith. Seixas had written a Hebrew grammar, and provided Smith with a copy of the 1834 second edition for his studies. The lessons continued for more than two months, and had some influence on the further development of the faith--most notably in the word Nau-Voo, which appears on page 50 of the Seixas grammar. See Louis C. Zucker, \"Joseph Smith as a Student of Hebrew,\" in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 3 (Summer 1968), pages 41-55. The grammar offered here is not the one used in Kirtland--that remains among Smith's papers in Salt Lake City--but it retains the same binding and printed label as Smith's copy. Goldman 183n; Rosenbach 381; Singerman 0590; not in Flake although an 1836 supplement is noted (7619)."
