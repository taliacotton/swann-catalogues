FOOTNOTE: "The privately printed memoir of a Detroit tannery magnate who went on a vacation in Yellowstone Park and Utah with his daughter and two friends. The 12 larger photographs are photochromes by the Detroit Publishing Company from negatives by William Henry Jackson, while the smaller photographs were taken by Schmidt's party. The leather for the binding was done at Schmidt's own tannery. In addition to the entertaining account of Yellowstone, Schmidt describes a visit to Salt Lake City, where he attends a memorial service for President McKinley at the Tabernacle. The book closes with a long description of the characters at Ophir Mine at Stateline in southwestern Utah, replete with tales of gunfights. Streeter sale VII:4123.<br><br>This copy was a gift from the author to Detroit building contractor Albert Albrecht (1853-1936). Schmidt's 21 December 1904 presentation letter reads in part \"I compelled some of my friends to work their way through the manuscript.
