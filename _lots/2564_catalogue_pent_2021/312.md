FOOTNOTE: "Jackson Edwin Guernsey (1910-1998) was raised in Shavertown, PA and graduated from Williams College in 1931, embarking on a career as a science teacher. On his summer breaks in 1933 and 1935, he undertook impressive cross-country trips, both documented here with photographs and meticulously presented itineraries. In the first, he took a bus from Pennsylvania to Portland, OR, bicycled across to eastern Montana, took another bus to Chicago, and bicycled home. The photographs show the Grand Canyon, redwoods, Crater Lake, Yellowstone Park, and the Century of Progress World's Fair in Chicago--95 snapshots in all. His 1935 trip took him southward through Kentucky (Mammoth Cave is represented), Alabama, and into Florida, circling around Lake Okeechobee before skirting along the coast to Charleston, SC and cutting inland via Virginia's Natural Bridge toward home--52 snapshots. Interspersed between and after the bicycle trips are shots of his work at the Wilkes-Barre Academy, including sporting events and a massive flood in March 1936, as well as a few family snapshots (81 non-bicycling shots in total)."
