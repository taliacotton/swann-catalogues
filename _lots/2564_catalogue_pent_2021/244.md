FOOTNOTE: "The last known photograph of Lincoln, taken two days after his \"With malice toward none\" second inaugural speech. Lincoln's full beard has here been trimmed to a rather imposingly severe goatee. According to one story, photographer Henry Warren had no appointment with the president for this sitting, but tricked young Tad Lincoln into bringing his father to the balcony. \"Posing just to please his son, Lincoln appears preoccupied and perhaps a little annoyed\"--Hamilton and Ostendorf, Lincoln in Photographs, O-112 and pages 213-4. After the assassination, the image was re-issued with the caption \"The Last Photograph of President Lincoln,\" but this is the first edition. It is usually seen in a much smaller format, about half this size."
