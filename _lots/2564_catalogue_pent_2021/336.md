FOOTNOTE: "An unusual piece of western ephemera: a volume of blank prisoner receipts to be used by a United States Deputy Marshal. Each receipt has blanks to record a prisoner's name, how many days the deputy had guard over him, and a certification that the lack of a nearby jail made this custody \"absolutely necessary for the safe custody of the prisoner herein named.\" The original owner was William S. Duncan (1866-1943) of Ada and Hickory, OK, who became a deputy in 1904. A 1937 interview with him in the Indian Pioneer History Collection recounts his exploits as a deputy."
