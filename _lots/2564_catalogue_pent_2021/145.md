FOOTNOTE: "\"I am informed, sir, that you offered the major's place in the army to two of your captains before Major Mitchell was appointed. . . . How they could be cal'd major and bare the same rank they now do is a thing I cannot solve by rule or grammar. . . . I realy conceive of your conduct to be degraiding of that set of officers, and as one of them I very modestly and calmly resent your conduct.\" Quite a cheeky letter to write to your commanding officer. <br><br>The damaged signature reads only \"Jo---,\" but the docketing reads \"Maj'r Hathaway's reflecting letter to G. Godfrey.\" Godfrey served as Brigadier General from January 1776 to July 1781. He appointed Abiel Mitchell as Major in February 1776, about the same time as John Hathaway was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel."
