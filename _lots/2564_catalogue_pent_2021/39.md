FOOTNOTE: "A dramatic ¾-length portrait of the general standing confidently as a battle rages behind him. Printseller C. Shepherd, responding to a great European demand for images of the American Revolution, issued a series of portraits during the war's first months, including 3 poses of General Washington. However, Washington had never crossed the Atlantic and no other Washington images were available on the British market until 1781, so these portraits were apparently created from Shepherd's imagination. No other record has been found of an actual artist named Alexander Campbell working in Virginia during this period. \"If the publishers assumed that priority alone would make these . . . likenesses popular, they were right . . . Within only a few years these fictitious images of Washington had spread through Europe\"--Wick, Washington pages 18-22. \"These Shepherd prints alone furnished to Europe a representation of Washington's appearance, and for that reason they have considerable importance\"--Morgan & Fielding, Life Portraits of Washington, page 53. Cresswell, American Revolution 206 (different state); Hart, Portraits of Washington 730."
