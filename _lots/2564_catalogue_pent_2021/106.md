FOOTNOTE: "This sweeping Mexican War view is credited to \"a sketch taken on the spot by Major Eaton, aid de camp to Gen'l Taylor.\" Among the junior officers who distinguished themselves that day were Braxton Bragg, William T. Sherman, and Jefferson Davis. The artist, Major Joseph Henry Eaton, was an accomplished amateur who left no other known works. Much of the credit for the quality of this print is surely due to the lithographer, Frances Flora Bond \"Fanny\" Palmer (1812-1876), who was foremost among the very few women in her field during that period. She began her career in England, emigrated to New York circa 1843, and did freelance work for a variety of publishers through 1849. She is best known for her prolific work for Currier & Ives through 1868. <br><br>American Battle Art 57. Not found in OCLC (although the Library of Congress holds a worn copy), and none traced at auction since 1924."
