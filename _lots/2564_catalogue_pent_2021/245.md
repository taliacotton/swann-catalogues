FOOTNOTE: "The Rev. Horace Carter Hovey (1833-1914) of the United States Christian Commission was visiting troops at City Point, VA: \"At the close of my discourse, a chaplain startled us by announcing the news which had just arrived of Pres. Lincoln's assassination. . . . On Tuesday, I reached Washington just in time to accompany some sixty delegates on a visit to the remains of our beloved president, whose horrible death has thrown the whole country into a state of astonishment & grief from which it has by no means as yet recovered.\" <br><br>He also describes an encouraging visit to Lincoln's successor: \"We called to pay our respects to Pres. Johnson. He made a fine speech to us, full of emotion & good sense, making a most favorable impression on every one of us. At its conclusion, we exclaimed with one voice, 'Pres. Johnson! We can trust you!' This interview went far to remove in my own mind the strong prejudice created by his disgraceful conduct on Inauguration Day.\""
