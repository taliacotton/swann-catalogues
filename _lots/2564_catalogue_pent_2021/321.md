FOOTNOTE: "\"On the Bridge at Hook-Eye Curve, C.M.R.R., Chief Engineer Wigglesworth Going to the Front.\" A bit faded with light soiling; caption partly illegible, transcribed from copy at Amon Carter Museum. Signed on verso by an early owner in July 1887. Colorado Springs, CO: George E. Mellen, Rocky Mountain View Company, circa 1887. <br><br>\"Black Canon at Curecanti Needle, D. & R.G.R.R. / Up Black Canon.\" Moderate dampstaining and minor wear to image. A striking view of the Curecanti Needle rock formation on the Gunnison River in western Colorado, with several cars of a freight train in the foreground. It apparently dates to shortly before the Denver & Rio Grande Rail Road became the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railway in mid-1881. The view is similar to the stylized view which formed part of the railroad's distinctive logo as the \"Scenic Line of the World.\" We trace no other examples of this view. Colorado Springs, CO; Mellen's Views, circa 1880."
