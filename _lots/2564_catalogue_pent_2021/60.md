FOOTNOTE: "Dozens of printings of the Declaration of Independence were produced through the 19th century, but we see very few broadside Constitutions. The present one appears to be unknown. It is embellished with a woodcut portrait of Washington, a decorative border and columns, and a list of \"Members of the Convention for Framing the Constitution.\" Thomas Morrison is named as publisher, and C.A. Elliott of Philadelphia as the printer. We find Thomas Morrison at this 47 South 3rd Street address in October 1830 and February 1832, but he had moved elsewhere by July 1833. He issued a very similar Declaration of Independence broadside from this same address, with the same printer, in December 1832. Not found in Hart, OCLC, at auction, or elsewhere."
