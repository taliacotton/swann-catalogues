FOOTNOTE: "Thomas W. Kizer (1824-1901) was a farmer from Winchester, IN who was active in the Indiana Sanitary Commission, providing aid to Union soldiers on the front. This letter is written from his expedition down to Vicksburg, MS, which had recently been surrendered by the Confederacy: \"We will start down the river to Natchez this afternoon at 5 o'clock to distribute the stores and to get a lot of sick men.\" <br><br>Kizer also describes a visit to the camp of the 1st Arkansas Infantry Regiment (African Descent): \"We stoped at Goodriches Landing last evening to see the nigger regments . It was a fine sight to see the niggers with new yankee harness and they was glad to see us. E. Sucker, James M'quis & Mrs. Thomas made them short addresses, for which they gave them three harty cheers. They sung Old John Brown and sevral other hymns &c. One of their captains made me a present of a cane.\"<br><br>Kizer's account is corroborated by the \"Report of the Indiana Sanitary Commission,\" which states \"Ran down to Goodrich's Landing, where the first Arkansas (colored) Regiment were, officered by Indiana men; gave them some vegetables, which they needed badly\" (page 129). \"Mrs. Thomas\" who lectured to the troops was very likely the famed Indiana physician and women's rights activist Mary Frame Thomas, who was also active in the Indiana Sanitary Commission."
