FOOTNOTE: "The 22nd Regiment of the National Guard of New York saw several short stints of active duty during the Civil War. Before they were called up, they wore gray uniforms trimmed in red, with a small \"22\" on their hats and the company letter on their belt buckle. They did garrison duty at Harper's Ferry in May 1862, during which many of them were photographed. Shortly after their return to New York, in September 1862, they switched to a more standard blue Union uniform for obvious reasons. This photograph shows 3 privates of the regiment's Company G, said to be brothers from the Hyde family. Edwin Francis Hyde (1842-1933) mustered in with Company G in May 1862; later photographs bear an unmistakable similarity to the soldier on the right in this photograph. His brother Augustus Lord Hyde also served in the regiment. For discussion of the uniform, see Michael J. McAfee, \"Uniforms & History: 22nd Regiment, National Guard, State of New York,\" in Military Images 10:3 (November 1988), page 28, which shows an example of another soldier in this uniform."
