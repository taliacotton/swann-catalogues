FOOTNOTE: "While other similar satires were published about \"Abraham of the House of Lincoln\" from 1865 through the early 20th century, we have found no close match for this one. It begins \"Now it came to pass in the year 1860 that Abraham of the House of Lincoln was chosen ruler over the land of Columbia,\" and concludes \"Are they not written in the second Book of Chronicles?\" (the biblical text which deals with the divided Kingdom of Judah). <br><br>The manuscript is unsigned, but was addressed to Lieutenant Jay Wilcox of the 6th Connecticut Infantry, a distinguished regiment best known for charging up the beach behind the 54th Massachusetts at the Battle of Fort Wagner (the climactic scene of the film Glory). Its envelope is postmarked 11 December 1863, just 5 months after that battle. Wilcox was then on leave in Waterbury, CT."
