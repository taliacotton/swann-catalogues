FOOTNOTE: This pair of representations of the four major continents apparently takes
  inspiration from Stampa's 4-print Emblems series, released 4 years earlier. Once
  again, the allegorical "America" wears a feathered headdress, holds an American
  flag, and stands aside a small monument to George Washington. In this one, her American
  Indian (or enslaved?) sidekick sits behind her, apparently learning to read; a rattlesnake
  slithers on the ground at her feet (a symbol of the betrayal of England?). Hart
  83.
