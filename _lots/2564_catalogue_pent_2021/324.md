FOOTNOTE: "Frank Jay Haynes (1853-1921) was the official photographer for the Northern Pacific Railroad and Yellowstone National Park, in addition to his own projects. He operated a studio out of a specially outfitted railway car which was carried from town to town. One of these photographs has a manuscript caption on verso: \"Cowboys Branding on the Range,\" dated by the negative at the Montana Historical Society to a ranch near Billings, MT on 25 October 1885. The other photographs are uncaptioned, but each has been matched to a corresponding captioned negative in the same collection: \"A Montana Cowboy, E. H. Brewster, Mingusville, Montana, June 23, 1890\"; \"Captain of the Roundup, F. P. Love and Horse, Mingusville, Montana, June 23, 1890\"; and \"Isadore Nollet House, The Home of the Cowboy, Mingusville, Montana, June 23, 1890.” Numerous Montana newspapers from June 1890 discuss the arrival of Haynes Palace Studio Car's first visit to the state (see the ad in the Yellowstone Journal of 19 June 1890, for example)."
