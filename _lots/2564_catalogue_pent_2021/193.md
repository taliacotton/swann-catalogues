Charles Sumner Cotter (1828-1886), author of this letter, was the captain of the battery. He writes: \"We are at Green River, where Buckner (the rebel genl) blew up the RR bridge. It was a beautiful structure of iron, one thousand yards from bank to bank. . . . He blew up one pier and destroyed two spands of the bridge and took all the track from the rest. . . . We have had several skirmishes with our picketts but have never come in range of my peices untill last Tuesday. They came up in force to attack us and prevent us from repairing rail road bridge. We had one regt of infantry acrost the river. They charged on them with the Texan Rangers but they were repulsed and I opened two of my peices on them with shell. . . . Their was fifty-four of the rebels killed and left on the field. . . . We lost sixteen killed.\" He also describes the battery's new flag given by the ladies of Louisville.
