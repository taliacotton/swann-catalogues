FOOTNOTE: 'When Joseph Smith set out to create a new translation of the Bible in 1830,
  he began with a copy of Phinney''s 1828 quarto edition. Changes were written in
  the margins by a series of assistants; the Joseph Smith Translation was then published
  from the annotated Bible in 1867. The original annotated Bible is still in the possession
  of the Community of Christ (RLDS). This Phinney Bible is not annotated by Joseph
  Smith, but it is from the same edition. We notice one other unusual quirk in this
  Bible: a faint diamond pattern impressed across the length of each sheet, presumably
  to flatten the leaves as they came off the press. Only one other book comes to mind
  which is often seen with a similar pattern, the 1830 first edition of the Book of
  Mormon. <br><br>This copy is the discount issue, published without plates or the
  99-page Apocrypha. Hills 618.'
