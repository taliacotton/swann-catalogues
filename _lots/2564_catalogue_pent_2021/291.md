FOOTNOTE: "A speech given in the weeks before the racially charged 1868 election, in which Reconstruction stood on trial. This unidentified Democratic speaker in Trumbull County, eastern Ohio, was not a fan of Reconstruction: \"Grant in his letter of acceptance says 'Let us have peace!' What intelligent mind can expect peace in a country where intelligence is disenfranchised and ignorant, idle and semi-barbarous Negroes have the governing power? Radicalism desires peace on those terms. It is the object of all their machinations to settle a peace upon the country with white men as slaves and serfs. . . . I understand that Mr. Garfield stated in a speech delivered in Warren on last Saturday night that the election of Seymour & Blair would bring war. We say let it come--the sooner the better. When it does come it will not be on the broad savannahs of the south, but in the hills of New England\" (14-15). Republican congressman (and future president) James A. Garfield addressed a massive Trumbull County Republican convention on Saturday 10 October 1868 in Warren, OH. This speech apparently shares a common provenance with the Proceedings of the National Convention of Union Soldiers and Sailors (preceding lot)."
