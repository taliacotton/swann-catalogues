FOOTNOTE: "The National Convention of Union Soldiers and Sailors was a Civil War veterans association which was formed in 1866 to support the Democratic Party, as a counter-balance to the Republican-leaning Grand Army of the Republic. The 1868 convention described here was held in conjunction with the Democratic Party convention being held in New York at the same time. These minutes were apparently compiled for publication a few weeks after the event. A few of the speeches and resolutions had been published in newspapers, and these are clipped and pasted in rather than transcribed. The keynote address by Major General Thomas Ewing is inserted in printed pamphlet form, with a copy stamped \"Sep 4 1868.\" As the organization seems to have lost momentum and disappeared shortly after this convention, these \"Proceedings\" were apparently never published."
