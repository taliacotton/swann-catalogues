A realistic dog turns tail, afraid of the guns, and three boys are to be made out in the grandstand seats, high in the branches of the big stage-set tree at the right. Warfare, Reinagle and Tanner believe, can be fun, especially if our side wins\"--American Battle Art 44. Offered without the scarce accompanying key. Stauffer 3134."
