FOOTNOTE: "Oliver Hazard Perry (1817-1864) of Cleveland, OH was not a close relative of the War of 1812 naval hero of the same name, but was certainly named in his honor. He kept detailed diaries of his hunting trips for deer and elk in the woods of Ohio and Michigan from 1836 to 1855. <br><br>Perry died in a railroad accident in 1864, and this finely printed volume was produced as a tribute \"for distribution among his personal friends\" 35 years later. It is illustrated throughout with tailpieces printed from original circa 1800 woodblocks by Alexander Anderson and others. The bookplate of distinguished collector Paul Lemperly (1858-1939) of Cleveland graces the front pastedown. Lemperly was too young to have been among Perry's friends, but he was certainly known to the proprietors of Marion Press, who produced this volume--they had printed his study of bookplates earlier that year. See \"A List of Books Printed at the Marion Press,\" 38 and 41. Both the book's editor Charles W. Bingham and Lemperly were active in the Rowfant Club, Cleveland's bibliophilic society, which would have been the natural constituency for this production.
