FOOTNOTE: "The full title reads \"Libro de Cosina para el buen uso de los S'ors y S'ras es muy util y en el se allan diversos pasteles, estofados, postres, chanfainas, sopas &c.\" A few clues point to a possible origin in the culinary hotspot of Oaxaca, including a partial recipe on the front endpaper for \"tortitas de huebo oajaqueña,\" and several recipes (pages 20, 39, 87 etc.) featuring the chilguacle [chilhuacle] chile, grown only in Oaxaca. Other Mexican dishes include \"vaca beracrusana\" (23) and \"guiso beracrusano\" (35), the stew called manchamanteles (57), tortillas reyenas (67), and in the dessert realm, torta de mamey (78). A small diagram for serving salad can be seen on page 56. Another unusual feature is a pair of chanfainas (Francesa and Española), a type of offal stew which originated in Extremadura, Spain and made its way to Mexico, pages 60-61."
