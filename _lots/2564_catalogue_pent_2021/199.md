FOOTNOTE: "A seating chart for the 31st Congress, 1st Session, which ran from December 1849 to September 1850. This diagram shows Vice President Millard Fillmore with a central seat as president of the Senate; he rose to the presidency of the United States after Zachary Taylor's death in July. Among the better-known senators shown are Stephen Douglas, Sam Houston, William Seward, Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun. The future war vice president Hannibal Hamlin is seated directly behind future Confederate president Jefferson Davis. It would be difficult to find a Senate with 8 more historically significant members than these. Below the seating plan is a directory showing the hotel or boarding house in which each senator resided. This session of Congress passed, in its waning days, the Fugitive Slave Act and the Compromise of 1850. 2 in OCLC."
