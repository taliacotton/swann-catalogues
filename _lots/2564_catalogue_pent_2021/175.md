FOOTNOTE: "First edition, with at least one other issued later in Virginia. The land agent Cornelius Boyle was a Confederate officer who, like many others, crossed the border at the conclusion of the war and tried to start over as a Mexican land speculator. The land he promotes here covered 575,640 acres on Mexico's Pacific coast in the state of Nayarit, about 50 miles north of Puerto Vallarta. Testimonial letters assert that the land is well suited for cotton cultivation, and that \"nature has done its utmost to make of this country a paradise, and only the hands of an industrious Anglo-Saxon population is required to develop it.\" We are assured repeatedly, however, that those industrious Anglo-Saxon hands will not be required to do any actual work, as the low cost of farm labor is emphasized: \"Cheap and reliable labour can be obtained on the Hacienda, and coolies can be introduced when they are needed.\" <br><br>Agent Boyle's most recent experience had been commanding a small Confederate prison camp at Gordonsville, VA, which might not be a strong credential for someone offering accommodations. One in OCLC, and none traced at auction."
