FOOTNOTE: 'Charles Albert Varnum (1849-1936) was Custer''s commander of scouts at
  Little Bighorn, surviving the fight alongside the Reno-Benteen detachment. He remained
  in the army and retired as a colonel at the end of World War One. By the time of
  his death, he was the last surviving officer from Little Bighorn. He wrote this
  letter in response to Frederic F. Van de Water''s book "Glory-Hunter: A Life of
  General Custer" (see above), the first to examine Custer critically. <br><br>"I
  received the copy of ''Glory Hunter'' in due time. . . . At my eighty-five years
  of age I am not always in condition to think or write. I . . . have read it & enjoyed
  it. I agree with the author''s comments on the General''s actions & his dividing
  his command. Had the Indians captured the pack train we would all have lost our
  lives. Saving that & uniting with Benteen saved us. What might have happened if
  Terry with Gibbon''s command had not arrived on the scene, the good Lord only knows."'
