FOOTNOTE: "This device was patented in New York in 1837, and if it worked as advertised, it would have been a gold mine. It could allegedly both sharpen a fence post AND dig the post hole. Wandle Mace discussed his invention in his autobiography; he sold the patent and erased a substantial debt, enabling him to emigrate to Illinois. There he became a prominent early Mormon who also helped build the Nauvoo Temple in 1846. None traced in OCLC, though Rutgers University holds an identically titled broadside which credits the printers as Craighead and Allen of New York, 1845."
