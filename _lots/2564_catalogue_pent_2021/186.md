FOOTNOTE: "A group portrait of members of the famed 7th New York Militia Regiment in full dress uniforms. The regiment was often known as the Silk Stocking Regiment because of the lofty social station of many of its members. They had helped quell many local disturbances in New York such as the Astor Place Riot and the Dead Rabbit Riot, and would soon be called into action for the New York Draft Riots in 1863. Their commander at this time was Alexander Shaler (1827-1911), seventh from the left, who would soon render distinguished service in the Civil War as a brigadier general at Fredericksburg and Gettysburg. On the pillar in the left frame is a hat bearing the 7th Regiment unit designation. Some of the men wear \"NY Second\" belt buckles. The man standing fifth from left is fainter, wearing a Union Army uniform, is slightly retouched in the negative, and may be slightly out of scale--he would appear to have been added later to the negative."
