FOOTNOTE: 'The first piece is a deathbed scene, with one of the two physicians checking
  Washington''s pulse and Martha Washington weeping at the foot of the bed. A bottle
  of medicinal port sits on the bedside table. Below are four lines of verse: "Americans
  behold & shed a grateful Tear / For a man who has gained yo''r freedom most dear
  / And now is departing unto the realms above / Where he may ever rest in lasting
  peace & love." This print was not issued with an imprint line, but was issued as
  a companion piece with "Lived Respected and Fear''d." "Its stark and unadorned simplicity
  . . . is truly a prototype for that favorite of lithographic images in the nineteenth
  century, the deathbed scene"--Wick 73. <br><br>The companion print shows Washington''s
  portrait atop a funeral urn. Above him flies the angel Fame bearing a scroll titled
  "Tears of America." The mourners are allegorical figures of Columbia (bearing an
  uncanny resemblance to Martha Washington in the earlier print) and Justice (holding
  her scales). This also has four verses below: "Columbia lamenting the loss of her
  Son / Who redeem''d her from Slav''ry & Liberty won / While Fame is directed by
  Justice spread / The sad tidings afar that Washington''s dead." This is the second
  of 3 states of this engraving. The first, identified by Hart as 644a, had a portrait
  after Wright. This second state replaces the portrait with one after Stuart. The
  more commonly seen third state erases the final words "& Luzarder 1800" from the
  imprint line. <br><br>Provenance: sold as a pair at Sloan''s Auction Galleries circa
  1985 to Alexandria, VA dealer Sumpter Priddy; "Lived Respected and Fear''d" sold
  shortly thereafter to the consignor; "Last Illness" spotted in a 2001 auction, withdrawn,
  and sold to the consignor to reunite the pair. One other traced at auction since
  1929, a "Last Illness" at a 2011 auction. 3 in OCLC. Deutsch, "Washington Memorial
  Prints," in Antiques, February 1977, pages 326 and 329, figures 5 and 13; Fowble
  205-6; Hart 644 (Lived Respected only); Wick 72-73.'
