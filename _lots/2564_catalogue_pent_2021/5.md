FOOTNOTE: "This view had a long history. The proprietor of Pennsylvania, Thomas Penn, wanted an engraved view of his bustling young city. Several artists tried and failed to capture the scene from across the river before mapmaker George Heap completed his 7-foot drawing in 1752. The resulting engraving was majestically detailed but too large to be conveniently displayed. A 3-foot version was engraved in 1756, followed by this unofficial adaptation of the second version which was issued as a plate in the London Magazine in October 1761. It features insets of the State House and battery. Snyder, City of Independence, 25 and pages 42-47, 57-58."
