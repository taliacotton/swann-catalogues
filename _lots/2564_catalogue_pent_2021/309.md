FOOTNOTE: "Christy's Minstrels were founded in 1843, and soon became the nation's leading blackface minstrel performers, helping to define the standard form of a minstrel show. This program is from early in their 7-year residency at Mechanics' Hall in New York, which began in March 1847. This program contains an unusual footnote: \"Gentlemen are requested not to beat time with their feet, as it is annoying to the audience generally, and confuses the Performers.\" Founder Edwin Christy and his stepson George disbanded the group by 1855, although other performers toured on the Christy's name for many years after."
