FOOTNOTE: "A thinly veiled reactionary commentary on the Georgia constitutional convention which had recently been held in Atlanta by delegates of all races. The illustration shows clothed dogs and monkeys running wild at a dinner table and a race track. The text professes not to understand the meaning to the picture, but hints broadly that \"it looks like a Scallawag Convention of the Sons of Harmony, and we can almost fancy, as we never looked in on the respectability of the Atlanta Convention, that it was designed as a pictorial of that exhibition.\" No other examples traced."
DESCRIPT: "(RECONSTRUCTION.)"
