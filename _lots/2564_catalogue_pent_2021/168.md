FOOTNOTE: "Probably the most notable photograph in this volume is a Mathew Brady studio portrait of the shadowy United States military intelligence leader, Colonel Lafayette Curry Baker (1826-1868). It is inscribed on verso \"Presented me by Mrs. Col. L.C. Baker, June 8 / 65.\" Soon after the war, Baker became enmeshed in a variety of scandals and was fired for spying on President Johnson. A conspiracy theory alleges that he was then poisoned for his inside knowledge of the Lincoln assassination. <br><br>The volume was kept by John Augustine Stambach (1840-1916), a Philadelphia hatter and furrier who served as a private in a Pennsylvania regiment. One photograph, captioned \"Ida,\" is likely his sister Ida Valerie Stambach (1853-1926), an early female medical school graduate who later practiced in California. Among the 7 photographs of uniformed soldiers in the album, one is inscribed by \"Capt. S.J. Kiffer\"[?] on recto. Notable figures include Samuel Morse, Horace Greeley, and Abraham Lincoln (a photograph of an engraving)."
