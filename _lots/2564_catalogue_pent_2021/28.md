FOOTNOTE: The first of these paired prints, issued in the same format and on the same
  date, is "The Memorable Engagement of Captn. Pearson of the Serapis, with Paul Jones
  of the Bon Homme Richard & his Squadron, Sep. 23 1779." It is a British depiction
  of one of the Battle of Flamborough Head, one of the great American naval victories
  of the war, spinning the defeated HMS Serapis as having "saved the Baltic fleet
  under his convoy, tho' obliged to submit to a much superior force." It was this
  battle in which John Paul Jones is said to have uttered the immortal words "I have
  not yet begun to fight." This print shows the battered Serapis near the end of the
  fight, with its mast blown off and two crew members clinging to it in the water.
  <br><br>Also included is the "The Distressed Situation of the Quebec & the Surveillante,
  a French Ship of War . . . 6th of October 1779.” This lesser-known battle between
  the British ship Quebec and a French naval vessel attempting to break blockade.
  The scene depicted is yet more dramatic than the Flamborough Head view, with the
  ruins of the Quebec in flames as the desperate crew takes to the water.
