FOOTNOTE: "\"Valued by collectors, as its illustrations give excellent examples of the work done by several American engravers of that time\"--Wright page 325. Among the engravers represented are Alexander Anderson (two maps of the Holy Land, and a view of Solomon's Temple) and Amos Doolittle (Triumph of David, and Judas Maccabeus defeating the Samarian army). Evans 30065; Hills 53. <br><br>This Bible has two pages of records from the family of Samuel Paynter (1736-1814) of Delaware. It was presented shortly after his death by his son Samuel Paynter Jr. (1768-1845), later the governor of Delaware, to St. Paul's Church in Georgetown, DE, as seen by the binding. The inscription explains that several decades later, after the church obtained a new Bible, this one was then repatriated to Gov. Painter's son Edwin R. Paynter (1839-1910)."
