FOOTNOTE: "This view was done shortly after the Uruguayan Civil War, in which Montevideo lay under siege for 8 years through 1851. The city had a large Italian population, and prominent among its defenders was an Italian legion led by Giuseppe Garibaldi. With peace, the city grew quickly as a mercantile port. This view shows a harbor packed with vessels bearing the flags of the United States, Italy, France, and more. A rowboat in the lower right bears the flag of Uruguay. An elaborately stylized version of the coat of arms of Uruguay appears in the lower margin."
