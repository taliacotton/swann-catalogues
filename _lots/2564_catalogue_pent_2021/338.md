FOOTNOTE: "Seth Bullock (1849-1919) was the first sheriff of Deadwood in 1876, and spent the remainder of his life there. This photograph is uncaptioned, but was taken by a Deadwood photographer, and Bullock was probably the only man in the Black Hills with a nose, ears, and moustache this large. He appears in military uniform, dating the scene to shortly after his return from the Spanish-American War as an Army captain. A likely date: Deadwood's 25th annual Independence Day parade, which featured \"the Grand Marshal, Captain Seth Bullock, in his uniform as a captain of United States Volunteers; mounted Indians from the Pine Ridge Reservation; aides to the grand marshal, D.F. Connor, G.P. Mills, and Henry Wyttenbach\" (Daily Deadwood Pioneer Times, 5 July 1901). <br><br>The stamp on verso reads \"C.B. Horton, Jr., Developing, Printing and Viewing, Deadwood St.\" This would very likely be Charles Bela Horton Jr. (1876-1944), then resident in Deadwood as telegraph manager, following in his father's footsteps, though we find nothing else connecting him to the photography business."
