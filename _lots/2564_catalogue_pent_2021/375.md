FOOTNOTE: "First edition of \"the earliest publication concerned solely with chocolate\"--Tigner & Carruth, Literature and Food Studies. Written by a Spanish physician, it was later translated into English, French, Latin, and Italian. Chocolate is here presented as a medicinal drink, to be prepared with red peppers, anise and vanilla, with a logwood husk, sugar, cinnamon, and almonds as options. That does not sound half-bad, with the caveat that we have no idea how the logwood would taste. He also notes that the chocolate is sometimes molded into tablets with sugar, and sold to the ladies of Mexico as a delicacy. European Americana 631/31; Medina BHA II:889 (calls for only one preliminary leaf); Palau 56904; Sabin 14542; Vicaire, page 190. None traced at auction since 1949."
