FOOTNOTE: "First edition in English, with extensive text also in Hebrew. The 1858 first edition, Gebetbuch f√ºr Israelitische Reform-Gemeinden, was \"the first prayer book in America published for general use that radically deviated from the traditional liturgy\" (Goldman 45). Einhorn was the leader of American Reform Judaism in his day, and his Olath Tamid went through numerous editions in both English and German. Einhorn fled Baltimore in 1861 because of his antislavery views, and this edition was translated for his new Congregation Adath Jeshurun on 39th Street in New York. Goldman 91n; Singerman 2340 (records just two copies)."
