FOOTNOTE: 'John Toan Mills (1821-1910) ran the Bull''s Head stagecoach line along
  Third Avenue up to 42nd Street in Manhattan, which was being driven out of business
  by a horse-drawn rail line along the same route. Starting in 1859, Mills began petitioning
  to be allowed to run his own horse-drawn cars along a portion of the same rails,
  on the principle that the rails were a public utility. This was granted in December
  1863, which brought him into conflict with the Third Avenue Railroad Company, a
  fast-growing company in the process of becoming the dominant streetcar operator
  in the city. This battle, which had a David vs. Goliath tone, continued in one form
  or another though at least 1886. Offered here are the files kept by Mills relating
  to this fight: correspondence, petitions, drafts of legislation, resolutions. Mills
  wrote constantly to governors, mayors, and state legislators in an effort to get
  formal support for his claim. One side battle was over construction costs due to
  his son-in-law John L. Brown; another was a battle with one Henry Hart, who had
  apparently welched on an offer to buy out the stage line. <br><br>One interesting
  file contains 11 long petitions circa 1861 filled with names and addresses of "property
  owners and residents," urging the state legis;lature to grant Mills rail access,
  "as a relief against the inconvenience and suffering we have been obliged to submit
  to for a number of years, by riding in crammed, over-crowded and ill-ventilated
  cars." Another file contains printed handbills, court cases, and legislative speeches
  on the case; other files include many manuscript drafts of legislation. Mills was
  continually writing and re-writing the history of the case. One result is a heavily
  annotated manuscript draft timeline history of the railway by Mills, starting in
  1830 ("Since 1830 stage lines existed on 3rd Ave & the Bowery & Chatham St. The
  first established was known as the Bulls Head Line"), and continues over 6 closely
  written pages through 1868, plus 4 pages of appended documents. Similarly, slips
  of paper contain extracts from his diary dated 1866 to 1872. His correspondence
  file includes retained drafts of letters to Governor Fenton, Mayor A. Oakey Hall,
  state senator Charles Folger (later Secretary of Treasury), and many others. Most
  of the papers relate to the Third Avenue Railway case, but also included are a file
  on construction work done for the Croton Aqueduct in 1868; and a battered but heavily
  annotated album of cartes-de-visite--family, friends, and Ulysses S. Grant. This
  archive is more than just a legal case--it is a twisted corner of New York life
  in the mid-19th century.'
