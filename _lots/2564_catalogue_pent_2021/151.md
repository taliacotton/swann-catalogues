FOOTNOTE: "Following his service at Saratoga in the fall of 1777, Van Cortlandt was temporarily detached from his command to help supervise the encampment at Valley Forge before returning to his regiment that summer. In this account, Van Cortlandt is registered for reimbursement for six separate expenses incurred during the Continental Army's final months at Valley Forge. He had paid Samuel Loudon of Fishkill, NY for military printing; Lawrence Fledetner for repairing drums; and Sergeant Thomas Bunting for an expedition in pursuit of deserters. In May he claimed \"expences of Several Officers from Valey Forge to Easton on command to receive recruits.\" The account concludes with a claim for \"expences on com'd by order of Genl. Washington from Valey Forge to White Plains.\""
