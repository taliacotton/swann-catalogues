CROSSHEAD: Les Amours d'Anne d'Autriche, Epouse de Louis 13, avec le Cardinal Richelieu,

TYPESET: 'Paris: Manuscript on Paper, circa 1700.<br><br>Quarto, seventy-nine inscribed
  pages, bound with four printed portrait engravings, text in a single column, eighteen
  lines per page in a professional italic hand, each within a thin red border; with
  eighteen blank leaves at the end; bound in full contemporary sponge-decorated calf,
  gilt-ruled boards, gilt-tooled spine, internally very fresh, 8 3/4 x 6 3/4 in.<br><br>This
  manuscript was made after the third printed edition of Eustache Le Noble''s work.
  The scribe has transcribed the complete title with printing place (Cologne) and
  date of imprint (1696). Anne of Austria (1601-1666) was queen consort to King Louis
  XIII of France and took up an opposing political position to Cardinal Richelieu
  (as she does in Dumas'' novel The Three Musketeers). Despite opposition she seized
  the reins of power as regent on behalf of their son after Louis'' death. She attracted
  enemies, and this work is the chief witness to them, alleging numerous sexual indiscretions,
  one with her enemy Richelieu, resulting in the apparent royal heir. The book was
  printed in Norwich and in Cologne. Ownership of a copy in France would have been
  quite dangerous in this period, but some person of means commissioned this fine
  copy.'
