  1 in.<br><br>Harriet (Hattie) Griggs (1845-1918) enrolled as a freshman in the inaugural
  Vassar College class for its first school year in 1865. She was born in Roxbury,
  Massachusetts to parents from the East coast. The family was living in Ohio when
  her younger brother was born, and then moved to Minnesota in the 1860s. She lists
  Faribault, Minnesota as her hometown at the time of her college enrollment and is
  recorded living at the same location on the census of 1870. Although she did not
  graduate, she did go on to marry Civil War veteran Elmer John Barker of the 5th
  New York cavalry in McHenry, in Illinois in 1876. She had three sons who lived to
  adulthood and a daughter who passed away in her first year. The details of Griggs's
  life seem to indicate that her parents explored an adventurous lifestyle in the
  middle part of the 19th century. She eventually settled in Crown Point, New York,
  on the west shore of Lake Champlain. Although Griggs herself never graduated, her
  daughter-in-law, Harriet Provost Fisher (1886-1974) successfully completed her Vassar
  degree in 1907, and her granddaughter, Janet Barker (1916-1973) was in the graduating
  class of the college in 1937. (cf. Vassar College. <i>Alumnae Biographical Register
  Issue</i>, page 438; Poughkeepsie, N. Y., 1939.)
