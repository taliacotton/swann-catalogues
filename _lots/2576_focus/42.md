TYPESET: "Boston: Warren's, [1870s].<br><br>CDV on a standard mount, not creased or trimmed, some discoloration to photo background, 4 1/4 x 2 1/2 in.<br><br>Stone was one of the early female graduates of Oberlin College, finishing her bachelor's degree there in 1847. She had a long career as an advocate of the suffragist movement, the abolition of slavery, and lived a life that exemplified female liberation. When she married a man, she kept her own name, and they split household expenses evenly. Stone was also involved in dress reform, the sometimes-controversial process by which women of this period cast off whalebone corsets and dresses that dragged on the ground, opting instead for bloomers under shorter skirts paired with tops and jackets."
