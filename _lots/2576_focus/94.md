In this work, Bocker recounts the results of a study she had just finished. \"Since January 1, 1923, the full-time efforts of a physician have been devoted to testing various devices, methods, and procedures. Work has been done with 1,208 patients, aggregating 1,558 cases, strictly within the legal boundaries set forth by Judge Frederick Crane of the New York Court of Appeals.\" Of the 1,208 patients in the study, 800 used some method of contraception. Bocker's conclusions are stark. Nursing baby, failure 100 percent; \"holding back,\" failure 100%; condom, failure 100%; douche, failure 100%; sponge, failure 100%; and so on. She does offer some successful alternatives. Along with the helpful image gallery, she includes brand names, descriptions of various devices, pharmaceutical preparations, and the names of pharmacies and manufacturers where doctors could obtain such products for their female patients."
