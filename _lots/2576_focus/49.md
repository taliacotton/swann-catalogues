  time is, <i>Little Women</i>, the story of four young girls, --Meg, Jo, Beth, and
  Amy. This is a thoroughly natural and charming book, fresh and full of life, and
  we heartily recommend it to all young people, big or little. We gave it to a little
  girl of twelve to read, for whose opinion we have great respect, and she pronounced
  it just the <i>nicest</i> book. ''I could read it right through three times, and
  it would be nicer and funnier every time.'' And, to our certain knowledge, she read
  it twice in one week, and would have read it again had not the book been carried
  off."-- Putnam''s Magazine'
