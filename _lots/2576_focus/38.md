TYPESET: "New York: Carleton, 1864.<br><br>First edition in English, octavo, xiv, [17]-317 pages, 6 pages of publisher's ads bound after the text; bound in brown publisher's cloth with an allover honeycomb pattern, stamped in blind, gilt-lettered spine (sunned), some light foxing to contents, 7 1/4 x 5 in.<br><br>D'Héricourt was a physician-midwife and feminist activist. She took misogyny head on, writing directly to writers who published their denigrating assessments of women. In the second section of this work, d'Héricourt is concerned with the following topics: the modern communist's take on women, objections to the emancipation of women, nature and functions of woman, love: its function in humanity, and marriage, ending with a summary of proposed reforms, and an appeal to women. \"How will [woman] become the equal of man in civil dignity? When she shall hold a place on the jury and by the side of all civil functionaries; shall be a member of boards of trade and mercantile associations; and shall be a witness in all cases in which the testimony of man is required. [...] Why ought every field of occupation to be accessible to woman? Because woman is a free being, whose vocation no one has a right to contest or to restrict.\""
