  contributed the Joan of Arc portrait to the Sister Chapel project. "The Sister Chapel
  (1974-78) was an important collaborative installation that materialized at the height
  of the womenâ€™s art movement. Conceived as a nonhierarchical, secular commemoration
  of female role models, The Sister Chapel consisted of an eighteen-foot abstract
  ceiling that hung above a circular arrangement of eleven monumental canvases, each
  depicting the standing figure of a heroic woman." It was created by a collaborative
  group of women artists in 1974. As a feminist conscious-raising experience, this
  project sought to create an alternative to the patriarchy. It is on display at Rowan
  University in Glassboro, New Jersey. (cf. Andrew D. Hottle''s <i>The Art of the
  Sister Chapel</i>, New York: Routledge, 2016.)<br><br>Russian-born industrial designer
  Belle Kogan (1902-2000) is considered the Godmother of Industrial Design and one
  of the founders of the profession itself. She founded her eponymous design studio
  in New York after attending Pratt, the Art Students League of Manhattan, RISD (where
  she studied silver design), and NYU. She employed female designers like Goldsmith
  at her firm throughout its history from 1932 through 1970.'
