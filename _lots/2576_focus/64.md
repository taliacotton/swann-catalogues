DESCRIPT: Demmer, Margaret (1865-1924)
year: 1865
CROSSHEAD: Two Journals Recording Details of her Daughter's and Granddaughter's Births
  and Childhoods.
TYPESET: '<br><br>Belmont, Allegany County, New York, circa 1886-1911.<br><br>Two
  folio-format ledger books from the period, one in half red morocco with marbled
  paper boards, the other in blind-stamped buckram; containing birth information about
  both children, beginning with Demmer''s own daughter, Margaret Anderson (d. 1973),
  with her birth in 1886, recording the child''s height and weight for her first fifteen
  years, vaccinations, school details, childish drawings, social events, gifts, lists
  of friends, a large hair lock, flowers from MA''s wedding, swatches of clothes (perhaps
  made by MD), and wedding ephemera, including a few dried flowers.<br><br>The granddaughter,
  Lucy Emma Barnfield''s (1906-1955) album is more detailed, dedicated by MD on first
  leaf, "To the child whose baby days go all too quickly," including newspaper clippings
  on baby care, LB''s published birth announcement, lists of gifts and givers, and
  extensive notes taken almost daily and quite factual at first: "Born Oct. 22nd,
  1906, Monday 7:15 am, 8 lbs. undressed. We all went to see the baby, a little worried
  about her feet at first, but Dr. B. said they would be all right," "Nov. 10, I changed
  L. first time," "Nov. 17, Mar. not so well, Dr. says not get up yet," "Nov. 24,
  Mar walked from couch to bed first time and came to table for first time," with
  MD''s own personal social notes mixed in.<br><br>By February, as the baby starts
  to engage with her grandmother, the details become more interesting, "Lucy doesn''t
  sleep quite as well toward a.m. Her face is quite broken out [eczema]. She laughs
  out loud, reaches out her hands & knows people, began 3rd big bottle malted milk,"
  other important milestones are recorded in July, when LB can stand alone, walk by
  holding onto furniture, play peek-a-boo and pattycake; the grandmother also notes
  her own emotions, "I wish they would give her to me, it seems as though she must
  be mine!" "She does so many cunning things, I don''t know how to write them. For
  instance, she doesn''t care for graham crackers, the one thing she could eat. She
  will feed them to Roxy and she has found out she can tease him by keeping them back
  & I will say, give it to Roxy, & she will shake her head for no, & when we ask her
  if she has any teeth she shakes her head & she waves her arms and legs for everything,
  and waves her hand bye-bye."<br><br>In all nearly 200 pages are meticulously filled
  with very detailed notes covering LB''s first five years, as well as several family
  photographs, LB''s early childish scrawls, followed by drawings, and some of her
  first letters; in addition to being an exhaustive history of this child, MD''s journal
  is also a document of attitudes and practices surrounding children and child-rearing
  in rural America at the beginning of the 20th century, sizes vary, content is extensive.
