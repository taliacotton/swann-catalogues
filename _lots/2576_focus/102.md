CROSSHEAD: Photo Album, circa 1929-1939.
TYPESET: 'Three-ring binder containing approximately 400 photographs depicting an
  approximate decade in the life of Dr. Clayton; all are small-format, black-and-white
  images, beginning with her time at Mount Holyoke College, where she was an assistant
  professor in the physiology department, many showing her colleagues, including the
  founder of that department, Professor Abby Howe Turner (1875-1957), and the other
  physiology adjuncts: Dorothy Elizabeth Williams, Mary Isabel Newton, and Helen McGregor
  TeWinkel; in addition to images of Clayton''s recreational activities, which include
  a trip to Europe with friends, day tripping in coastal Maine, hiking, and photos
  of family, snapshots of other medical professionals, such as obstetrics and gynecological
  physician Dr. Katherine Kuder and her sister, the researcher Alberta Kuder, and
  many other women working in the medical and scientific fields; photos in a good
  state of preservation.<br><br>Clayton was born in Shelbyville, Indiana. She graduated
  from Bucknell Institute in 1912, and earned a bachelor''s degree at Barnard, through
  the Columbia Teacher''s College in 1918. She subsequently entered the University
  of Rochester, where she earned her master''s degree and Ph.D. in vital economics.
  Clayton taught at Mount Holyoke for six years in the physiology department under
  Professor Turner, specializing in nutrition studies. In 1934, she moved to Maine
  to take a position as nutritionist at the university in Orono. This album covers
  the period at Holyoke, and the move to Maine. It illustrates Clayton''s life brimming
  with travel, social activities, and adventure, surrounded by a network of other
  women with careers and education similar to her own. When this album arrived at
  Swann, Clayton was unidentified. She had only written "self," "myself," or nothing
  at all on her own pictures. The cataloger is gratified to attach Clayton''s name
  and biography to the stories told by these photos.'
