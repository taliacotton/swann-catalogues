  are siblings who participated in the University of Minnesota’s “Transsexual Research
  Project," undergoing gender reassignment surgeries in 1967. "After being female
  for 48 years I will tell you that my sister and I have not regretted one moment
  of that 48 years. Would I go through numerous surgeries, and endure all that pain
  and tears again? You ‘betcha’, as life as a male would be unendurable and life would
  not be worth living." (Lauraine Lee, 22 March 2015; http://transascity.org/lenette-and-lauraine-lee-1970/)<br><br>April
  Ashley, born in Liverpool in 1935, was outed by the <i>Sunday People</i> newspaper
  in 1961. The British courts found that she was not entitled to support following
  her divorce because she was a legal man and therefore could not legally wed "another"
  man. Her autobiography, <i>The First Lady</i>, came out in 2006.<br><br>Christine
  Jorgensen (1926-1989) grew up in the Bronx and served in the army during World War
  II. Because her transition was highly publicized, and she was a proficient communicator,
  and wonderful public presence, she contributed greatly to the general public''s
  awareness of trans issues and trans rights, in addition to supporting other trans
  people.'
