LOT: "99"
LOW: "700"
HIGH: "900"
DESCRIPT: Gray, Bonnie Jean (1891-1988)
year: 1891
CROSSHEAD: Archive of Photos and Papers of the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame Inductee
  and Trick Rider.
TYPESET: Approximately twenty black-and-white photographs from Gray's personal collection,
  most showing Gray or her friends and colleagues in action, trick riding in arenas,
  or posing for promotional shots; including a group of ten photos taken during the
  production of a lost and seemingly undocumented western identified by Gray as <i>The
  Scorpion</i>, shooting in Los Angeles in November of 1920; each photo from the production
  carefully annotated by Gray on the verso, several signed; [together with] a collection
  of Gray's personal paperwork, including property tax receipts, Steinway piano receipt,
  blank contracts, advertising ephemera from the 1920s and 1930s pertaining to her
  shows, and correspondence from show promoters; approximately thirty documents; [and]
  a photo of Gray with the Spirit of St. Louis taken at a celebration for Lindbergh
  in Cheyenne, Wyoming on Labor Day, September 2, 1927; her retained, typed, and signed
  copy of an extremely laudatory, if not downright flirty letter to Lindbergh, and
  other related ephemera.<br><br>Gray studied music at the University of Idaho and
  completed graduate work at the University of Chicago. Her focus was the piano, but
  she also was a tri-state tennis champion in college, trained as a nurse, and cared
  for members of the Apache tribe during the 1918 flu pandemic in Arizona. Her real
  love was trick riding. She rode horses and bulls (in Mexican bullfights). She claimed
  to be the first female rider to successfully perform the "under the belly crawl,"
  and was famous for jumping her horse King Tut over an open car complete with passengers,
  a trick she performed on her wedding day, with her groom in the car. She also worked
  as a stunt rider in films, often riding for male actors, including Tim McCoy, Tom
  Mix, Hoot Gibson, and Ken Maynard. The production stills in this lot show a lost
  western which included Gray in the cast, not as a stunt double. She was inducted
  into the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame in 1981, at the age of 90.
