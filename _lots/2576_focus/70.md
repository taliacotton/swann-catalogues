TYPESET: 'Large black-and-white photographic portraits of Juliana R. Force (1876-1948),
  Anne Goldthwaite (1869-1944), and Elisabeth Weber-Fulop (1886-1966), all images
  produced by Peter A. Juley & Son of New York, each mounted on album pages, each
  measuring approximately 7 x 9 1/2 in. on 11 x 14 in. mounts. (3)<br><br>Force served
  as Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney''s private secretary, eventually becoming the first
  director of the Whitney Museum. She also actively promoted the artistic legitimacy
  of American folk-art beginning with a Whitney show in February of 1924.<br><br>Goldthwaite
  exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show. An activist and vocal supporter of the woman''s
  suffrage movement, she observed, "that women have a valid place as women artists
  is both obvious and logical. We want to speak to an audience that asks simply, ''Is
  it good?'' not, ''Was it done by a woman?''" (Lynne Blackman, <i>Central to their
  Lives: Southern Women Artists in the Johnson Collection</i>, Columbia, South Carolina,
  University of SC Press.)<br><br>Weber-Fulop had her first solo show in Vienna when
  she was eighteen years old. In New York, she painted interiors and cityscapes, like
  her painting of the Essex House seen in this portrait.'
