Juley & Son of New York, each mounted on album pages, each measuring approximately 7 x 9 1/2 in. on 11 x 14 in. mounts. (3)<br><br>Buller was a Canadian artist who emigrated to New York in the early decades of the 20th century to study at the Arts League. She painted in a hyper-realistic style, often uniting objects in a still life tableau suggestive of a dreamscape, hinting at hidden meaning while simultaneously resisting obvious narrative interpretation. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Whitney and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<br><br>When Paeff was a young teenager, she left her family in Minsk to study art in Boston. Her public sculptures dot New England. In Boston's Public Garden, her fountain sculpture of a small boy holding a bid is a stop on the Women's Heritage Trail. The original 1934 casting was stolen decades ago.<br><br>Schulte was a New Yorker that spent a significant part of her career working and painting in Paris. Another product of the Art Students' League, she was known for still-lifes and cityscapes, and her canvases are held by the Smithsonian, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and MoMa."
