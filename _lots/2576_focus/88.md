TYPESET: 'London: Leonard & Virginia Woolf, Hogarth Press, 1929.<br><br>First edition,
  octavo, bound in publisher''s terracotta cloth, in a very good dust jacket, with
  cover art by Vanessa Stephen Bell (1879-1961); contemporary label of the Gotham
  Book Mart at 51 West 47th street pasted inside back board, very good, 7 x 4 1/4
  in.<br><br>Woolf''s important contribution to feminist literature is a contemplation
  on women''s social treatment (compared to men''s), and how it affects their creation
  of art. "This leads to a sketch of women''s circumstances in the past, and the effect
  of those circumstances upon their writing. The conditions that are favourable to
  imaginative work are discussed, including the right relation of the sexes." (Quoted
  from the dust jacket blurb.)<br><br>Vanessa Bell, Woolf''s older sister, and also
  a member of the Bloomsbury Group, studied painting at the Royal Academy. She painted,
  illustrated dust jackets for her sister''s work, and produced the Famous Women Dinner
  Service: fifty hand-painted plates celebrating important women throughout history,
  from Catherine the Great and Pocahontas, to Charlotte Brontë, Greta Garbo, herself,
  and her sister.<br><br>The Gotham Book Mart was established and run by Frances Steloff
  (1887-1989) from 1920 until her death at the age of 101. Steloff''s iconic book
  shop was a hub of literary society in the city for more than eight decades. She
  hosted author readings, art shows, and meetings of literary clubs, including the
  James Joyce Society, which held its first meeting there in 1947. A champion of literature
  under siege, Steloff sold banned titles like <i>Lady Chatterley''s Lover</i>; <i>the
  Tropic of Cancer</i>; and Joyce''s <i>Ulysses</i>. When Anaïs Nin was forced out
  of Paris, she sent her books to Steloff for safekeeping. (cf. <i>Frances Steloff:
  Memoirs of a Bookseller</i>, a short documentary by Deborah Dickson, 1987)'
