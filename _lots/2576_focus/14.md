  notorious and extremely popular collection of stories quickly found its way to the
  Catholic church''s index of prohibited books. The author was a physician, writer,
  a member of the Accademia dei Filarmonici of Verona, and of the Incogniti of Venice.
  "The Lamp of the novel has in many other previous existences experienced innumerable
  reincarnations: as an innocent girl; a prostitute; historical characters such as
  Sulla, Cleopatra, and Ravaillac; animals such as a flea, a mouse, a horse, a bee,
  or a cricket. On four consecutive evening, the Lamp instructs its current owner
  and interlocutor [...] with fantastic tales inspired by Boccaccio, Aretino, Bandell,
  Barclay, and others. The <em>Lucerna</em> is a collection of novelistic narratives
  focusing for the most part on the dark, even pathological, sides of human ethos
  and behavior." (cf. Bondanella &amp; Cicarelli''s Cambridge Companion to the Italian
  Novel, 2003, page 32.)</p>'
