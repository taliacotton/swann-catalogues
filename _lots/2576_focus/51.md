DESCRIPT: Woodhull, Victoria (1838-1927) & Tennessee Claflin (1844-1923)
year: 1838
CROSSHEAD: Five Cartes-de-visite, circa 1870.
TYPESET: 'Three cards of Woodhull, two images of the same pose, one printed by Geo.
  Stinson & Co., in Portland, Maine, one unmarked, the third New York: G.W. Thorne;
  and two images of Claflin in which she is identified as "Broker" on both; some toning,
  other slight defects, each 4 x 2 1/2 in. (5)<br><br>In 1870, Woodhull and Claflin
  were the first women to open a Wall Street stock brokerage. Their father was a snake
  oil salesman and occasional sham attorney or physician. The two girls were exploited
  for profit by their father who promoted them as psychic mediums in their early years,
  a career they continued to cultivate in young adulthood.<br><br>The brokerage was
  very successful, and the profits enabled Woodhull and Claflin to publish their own
  eponymous weekly radical newspaper. Advocates of the Free Love movement (which pushed
  for women''s right to marry, divorce, and have children without social or state
  restrictions), their paper was also the first in the U.S. to publish Marx''s <i>Communist
  Manifesto</i> in English.  Woodhull and Claflin ran for President and Vice President
  of the United States in the 1872 election, nominated by the Equal Rights Party.
  They faced stiff disapproval and opposition and were often simply ignored. Anthony
  Comstock jailed both sisters for publishing an obscene newspaper at the time of
  the 1872 election, making it impossible for them to attempt to vote or promote their
  feminist and suffragist causes. Both women left New York for Great Britain in 1877.'
