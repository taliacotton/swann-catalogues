year: "1907"
CROSSHEAD: "Portrait, 1933."
TYPESET: "Black-and-white photograph bearing Bloch's label on the verso, \"Lucienne Bloch Dimitroff\" inscribed in ink, \"Lenin Panel, New Workers School NYC Nov. 1933\" (it is more likely that the photograph was taken in April or May of 1933); showing Kahlo before Diego Rivera's mural, <i>Man at the Crossroads</i>, standing, leaning on one elbow, gazing at the camera; (corners slightly bumped), 5 x 7 in.<br><br>Bloch and Kahlo formed a close friendship in the early 1930s while the former apprenticed with Diego Rivera. Bloch's are the only photographs of this particular work of Rivera's, as it was destroyed by John D. Rockefeller, by whom it was originally commissioned. Bloch was also part of Rivera's crew on the project, one of a six-person team employed in scaling up the mural from the artist's smaller paper sketch to full-sized format on tracing paper, destined for the wall, and later, destruction. In this portrait, Lenin looms over Kahlo's head, with Marx at his right shoulder, sketchy areas fringe the bottom sections of the painting."
