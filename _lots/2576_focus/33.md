TYPESET: 'Assisi: [Si vende nella Stamperia Taglioretti al Cordusio in Milano], 1794.<br><br>First
  edition, octavo, A-G8, bound in contemporary decorated limp paper wrappers, 6 1/8
  x 4 1/8 in.<br><br>This proto-feminist work represents a milestone in the Early
  Modern Italian conversation on gender. Califronia refutes the scornful polemic treatises
  on "female nature" written in her day. She argues that human rights should apply
  to women as well, since they possess mental capacities equal to men. She also maintains
  that education should be provided equally to both women and men, since women in
  their intellectual abilities are as reasonable and capable as men.<br><br>This work
  reflects a certain conservative spirit but reiterates the refusal to reduce the
  characteristics of women to their physical and biological conformation (a tendency
  shared by some French Ideologists), and the injustice of morally judging women based
  on their condition.<br><br>Rare.'
