TYPESET: "Oblong folio album with embossed art nouveau cover featuring a mermaid; consisting of thirty-two black album pages mounted with 126 original black-and-white photos depicting the young women's activities at school; front cover and some pages detached, single signature of sixteen leaves, indicating that all original pages are present, 14 x 9 in.<br><br>The undergraduates in these pictures seem to be having a wonderful time at college. They dress up in a variety of ways, in formal dress, as men, in casual garb in their dorm rooms. They are seen boarding a steamship, bathing at the beach, dancing, acting out a mock wedding, fording a stream, dressing as soldiers, picnicking. Multiple dorm interiors are also photographed. Their everyday style is that of the prototypical Gibson girl, and their very long hair is almost always worn up, in the fashion of the day. In one shot, a group of more than a dozen girls in long white gowns are kneeling and clasping hands, their long hair loose, hanging all the way down their backs. Goucher activities include the \"Baby Show,\" and a number of dramatic productions, including <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, <i>Robin Hood</i>, Tennyson's <i>The Foresters</i>, and what might be <i>The Mikado</i>, Milton's <i>Comus</i>, and a dramatic rendition of <i>Achilles on Skyros</i>. The last three are mentioned in <i>Donnybrook Fair</i>, the Goucher yearbooks from the period between 1910 and 1915."
