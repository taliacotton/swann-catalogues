TYPESET: "Albumen photograph on a period mount inscribed in pencil on verso with the artist's name and her 1523 Chestnut Street Philadelphia studio address; the photo hinged onto a new archival mat and joined window, 5 x 7 in.<br><br>Oakley and her sister Hester rented the studio on Chestnut Street in 1897, for their own use, along with the artists Elizabeth Shippen Green, and Jessie Wilcox Smith. The friends were all former students of Howard Pyle, who gave the group the moniker, the Red Rose Girls. The living arrangement of mutual support is described in detail in Alice Carter's book, <i>The Red Rose Girls: An Uncommon Story of Art and Love</i>. In this contemporary image, Oakley stands with her back to a mirror, holding a large palette, in the background we see a comfortable sofa decorated with patterned pillows, a mantle draped in fabric with sculptures and objets d'art, framed pictures on the walls, floral drapes, and a full coal scuttle. The group disbanded in 1911 when Green married. Okaley was a successful muralist and designer of stained glass who favored historical topics and Pre-Raphaelite, and Renaissance-revival style. Her illustrations appeared in The Century Magazine, Collier's, St. Nicholas, and Woman's Home Companion."
