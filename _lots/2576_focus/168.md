DESCRIPT: Ginsburg, Ruth Bader (1933-2020)
year: 1933
CROSSHEAD: Signed Dissenting Opinion Cover Sheet, Shelby County v. Eric H. Holder.
TYPESET: Circa 2013.<br><br>Single initial page of the late Justice Ginsburg's dissenting
  opinion, signed diagonally at upper right; remnants of mounting at upper and lower
  edges verso, 8 1/2 x 11 in.<br><br>Ginsburg's dissenting opinion, in which she was
  joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, stated that Congress had sufficient
  evidence to find whether the voting rights coverage formula (preclearance) currently
  in place was actually working to facilitate free and fair voting. "Throwing out
  preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory
  changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting
  wet." Since this Supreme Court ruling, several states formerly subject to preclearance
  have passed laws to remove online voter registration, early voting, Sunday Voting,
  same-day voter registration, pre-registration for seventeen-year-olds, and other
  measures put in place to make voting easier.
