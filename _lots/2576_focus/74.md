  with Transatlantic Post Office postmark, 5 1/2 x 3 1/2 in.<br><br>Text written mid-ocean
  on the way to Liberia on a Christian missionary voyage. Delaney was one of the earliest
  African American missionaries to work in Africa. An 1894 graduate of Spelman Seminary
  in Atlanta, she finished formal missionary training two years later, and traveled
  to Africa for the first time in 1902. Upon arrival, she became the first African
  American woman missionary to arrive on the continent. The present postcard was composed
  on a later mission to Monrovia. During this venture, she established the Suehn Industrial
  Venture (1916) and stayed until disruption because of the first world war forced
  her back to the U.S. in the fall of 1920.
