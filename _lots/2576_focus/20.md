  in.<br><br>Vokins was an ardent member of the Society of Friends who traveled as
  a transatlantic missionary of faith. She arrived in Oyster Bay, Long Island in New
  York early in 1680, traveling with her friends Sarah Yoklet and Lydia Wright. Her
  main objective was establishing Women''s Meetings in the colonies as she had done
  at home in Charney Bassett, England.  She visited Providence, Rhode Island; Boston;
  East & West Jersey; Pennsylvania; Barbados; Nevis; and Antigua. While in Barbados,
  she led meetings with Black and white congregants, "and the power of the Lord Jesus
  was mightily manifested, so that my Soul was often melted therewith, even in the
  Meetings of the Negro''s or Blacks." This posthumously published work is a collection
  of Vokins''s letters, many written during her journey. Supporting prefatory material
  is contributed by several other Quaker women, including Theophila Townsend (1656-1692).
  The Society of Friends'' strong stance on gender equality meant that Quaker women
  were able to see their own work in print during the 17th century, even as they were
  simultaneously jailed, executed, and otherwise persecuted for their beliefs.<br><br>ESTC
