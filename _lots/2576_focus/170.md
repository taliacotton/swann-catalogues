  a small abstract drawing; in full, "An aunt who has the pride of a mother will miss
  you very much- with Love, Auntie Arlene"; the sheet 6 x 8 in.<br><br>Wilkes was
  a body artist, photographer, painter, and sculptor, who also used video to explore
  the masculine gaze, female body, sexuality, narcissism, and ultimately her own experiences
  with cancer and cancer treatment that ended her life at the age of fifty-two. In
  the late 1960s, she used clay to make small sculptures of the vulva. As she explored
  the work further, she expanded her preferred media to include chewing gum, kneaded
  erasers, dryer lint, and other unconventional materials. In the 1970s, she began
  working in photographic body art, applying dozens of small, sculpted vulvas to her
  own body. The work later took the form of more involved "perfomalist" video self-portraits.
