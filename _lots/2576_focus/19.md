Her cult was extremely popular with the population of her hometown of Querétaro City in central Mexico, where she lived at the Santa Clara convent. Huge crowds attended the mass commemorating the first anniversary of her death. In 1686, her remains were exhumed for more prominent display in the Santa Clara church.<br><br>Paula de Benavides and her husband Bernardo Calderón began printing books and pamphlets in Mexico City in 1631; widowed with six children, she took over the business in 1641 and died in 1684. This book was printed by her heirs. During her forty-three-year career as a printer, Benavides printed at least 448 titles in Mexico City and ran an expansive book store. She created a printing and bookselling dynasty that persisted for three generations after her death. Daughters, daughters-in-law, granddaughters, and great-granddaughters continued printing using the Benavides name. (cf.
