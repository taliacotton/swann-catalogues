  Nivedita was born and raised in Ireland with the name Margaret Elizabeth Noble.
  She first visited India in 1898, and in that year swore to uphold Brahmacharya,
  complete control of body and mind through asceticism, principle fundamental to a
  monk''s life. She studied with Swami Vivekananda, who gave her the name Nivedita,
  which means "Dedicated to God." A champion of Indian Nationalism, she lived the
  rest of her life in India, where she founded a school for girls (her main reason
  for coming to the country), nursed plague patients in the 1899 epidemic, and participated
  in international fund and awareness raising efforts on behalf of the Indian independence
  movement. She died at Roy Villa in Darjeeling in 1911. At time of the publication
  of this catalog, the dedicatee, Sophie Wallerstein, has yet to be identified.<br><br>Rare,
