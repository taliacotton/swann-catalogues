  was born in Waddington, New York. She was an 1892 graduate of City Hospital, a nurse
  at Blackwell, and Superintendent of Gouveneur Hospital from 1895 until 1921. In
  the early photo of the original Gouverneur Hospital buildings its famous horse-drawn
  ambulance is standing in readiness. In 1902, Dr. Emily Dunning Barringer (1876-1961)
  became the first woman ambulance physician at Gouverneur Hospital, which served
  the lower east side of New York. Circa 1894, when Stowers was stationed on the so-called
  "Welfare Island" i.e., Roosevelt Island, in the East River, it housed a notorious
  complex of workhouses which included a large central hospital, as well as an almshouse,
  a smallpox hospital, and a hospital designated for patients deemed "incurable" by
  the system, which included those suffering from mental and physical disabilities.
  Investigative reporter Nellie Bly infiltrated the Women''s Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell
  Island in 1887, and wrote <i>Ten Days in a Madhouse</i>, an expos√© on the inhumane
  conditions she found there.'
