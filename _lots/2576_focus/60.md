DESCRIPT: Gilman, Charlotte Perkins [aka Stetson] (1860-1935)
year: 1860
CROSSHEAD: The Yellow Wall-Paper.
TYPESET: '<i>New England Magazine</i>, Boston: New England Magazine Corp., September
  1891-February 1892.<br><br>The first appearance of the story in print, occupying
  pages 647-656, with three illustrations by Joseph Henry Hatfield (1863-1928), bound
  in later boards, awkwardly attached at the inner joints (preliminaries glued tightly
  to inside of front board), other defects to contents include spotting, marginal
  tears to inner gutters of the story; waterstained at the end, some tears to other
  parts of the book, 9 1/4 x 6 1/4 in.<br><br>The autobiographical <i>Yellow Wallpaper</i>
  is part of the feminist canon. It appears in countless textbooks and is the Feminist
  Press''s bestseller. Gilman had suffered through Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell''s (1829-1914)
  unsuccessful "rest cure" for her depression at her husband''s behest. Scholarship
  by Julie Bates Dock on the work has shown that later reprints contain textual changes
  when compared to this first edition.<br><br>"In its twenty-five-year odyssey of
  rediscovery by literary critics, [...] the story has picked up along the way an
  assortment of blemishes and distortions, from textual anomalies to skewed accounts
  of its publication history to misinformation about its contemporary reception."
  (cf. <i>Charlotte Perkins Gilman''s "The Yellow Wallpaper" and the History of its
  Publication and Reception: a Critical Edition and Documentary Casebook</i>, published
  in the Penn State series in the History of the Book, Penn State Press, 1998.)'
