Karslake's daughter Constance was in charge of the workshop near her father's Hampstead Bindery, accepting women already trained in the arts and enrolling a few dozen women at a time. Although not a successful venture during its short operation, which ended in 1903, the bindings produced by the workshop are masterful examples of the craft decorated with finely executed Art Nouveau designs in gold and goatskin."
