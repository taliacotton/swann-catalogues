DESCRIPT: Russell, Jane (1819-1914) Archive of Letters, 1840s.
year: 1819
CROSSHEAD: Written during a Whaling Voyage, from Hawaii, and Other Ports.
TYPESET: Twenty-one letters of which seventeen are written by Russell (four written
  while Russell was still a girl), two by her husband, Captain Charles Weatherby Gelett
  (1813-1895) and one written by Mary G. Smith from the ship <i>Saratoga</i> to Russell
  while onboard the <i>Uncas</i>; all but one letter addressed to Russell's mother,
  Amelia Drew Russell (1785-1868); some with exotic postmarks from Hong Kong, Hawaii,
  Lahaina, and other ports; the bulk of the letters written during the voyage of Gelett's
  whaling vessel, the <i>Uncas</i>, which was at sea between August 1846 and the spring
  of 1849;  most are stamped "Ship" and were eventually routed through New Bedford,
  Massachusetts on their way to Kingston, MA; sizes generally 9 3/4 x 7 3/4 in.<br><br>For
  extended periods of time, Russell was left in Hawaii while her husband returned
  with his crew to sea in order to further add to his stores of sperm whale oil. Russell's
  letters are those of a pious New England girl, but we can infer her sense of adventure
  intermingled with her sometimes-harping piety. One may also consider that she was
  writing to her mother. Russell recounts some tales of the whaling ship and describes
  Faial in the Azores and her inbound and outbound visits to Valparaiso, Chile. She
  has written up amusing character sketches for each member of the crew as well, including
  each person's name, rank, job onboard and their original home places.<br><br>Some
  of the most interesting material stems from her grand adventures on the Hawaiian
  Islands, where she traveled by foot, double canoe, and horseback, was carried in
  a litter, and visited volcanos and missionaries. The longest journey, made with
  her husband and a retinue of about fifteen while he took a break from his seafaring
  saw them making tracks over rugged stretches of "clinkers" (fields of broken-up
  lava rock) and sleeping on the ground in tents, in smoke-filled native grass huts,
  and caves.<br><br>By November of 1848 the <i>Uncas</i> crew had accumulated 3,700
  barrels of whale oil, and the Captain was building his seasick-prone wife a house
  on deck in preparation for the voyage home. Leaving Honolulu at this date, headed
  for Valparaiso, they hope to encounter a few more whales along the way to fill the
  ship completely, and to reach home by May 1849.<br><br>The California gold rush
  was complicating the procurement of crew in Hawaii in the fall of 1848. Russell
  notes that sailors were leaving in droves (or begging to be released) while others
  turned down large salaries for the chance to try their luck in the gold fields of
  California. She also mentions that measles and whooping cough were sweeping through
  the population of native Hawaiians with devastating effects.<br><br>After returning
  home, Russell and Gelett lived in Minnesota for a short time, but the captain was
  drawn again to the sea, without his wife on subsequent voyages. Eventually the couple
  retires to California. Russell lived to the age of 95 and is buried at the Nordhoff
  Cemetery in Ojai, California.
