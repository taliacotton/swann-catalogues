She was recognized as a Black novelist during her lifetime. An 1892 newspaper article on <i>True Love</i> and its author praises her as \"the first colored woman who has ever produced and published a novel.\" Details in this short newspaper notice line up neatly with Chicago census data from 1880. (<i>The Morning Democrat</i>, Davenport, IA 17 July 1892.) Farro's novel was one of fifty-eight books exhibited by Illinois women writers at the World's Fair in 1893. Even so, the book is rare in libraries and non-existent in the auction record.
