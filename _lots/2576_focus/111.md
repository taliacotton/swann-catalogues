Knopf's children's book department. During the 1930s, she worked for the National Park Service as production supervisor as well as providing them with original artwork and copy. She designed sixteen posters for the National and State Parks in all, using her own signature combination of bold typography and graphics. Her pared-down two- and three-color graphics create strong visual impact and stand out when compared to other American designs of the period. \"[The National Parks posters] show Waugh's stylistic range, design clarity and inventive typography.\" (Resnick p. 48); <i>Posters for the People</i>, page 83."
