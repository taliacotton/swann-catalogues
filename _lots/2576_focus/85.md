TYPESET: "Large black-and-white photographic portraits of Margaret Frances \"Peggy\" Bacon (1895-1987); Hilda Belcher (1881-1963); and Marguerite Thompson Zorach (1887-1968) all images produced by Peter A. Juley & Son of New York, each mounted on album pages, each measuring approximately 7 x 9 in. on 11 x 14 in. mounts. (3)<br><br>Bacon was a prolific drypoint print maker, author, and book illustrator whose images graced many <i>New Yorker</i> magazine covers. She was a winner of the Guggenheim Fellowship and is known for her satirical caricatures and illustrations of cats.<br><br>Belcher was the second woman accepted into the National Academy of Design. Her prize-winning 1907 watercolor portrait of Georgia O'Keeffe, \"The Checkered Dress,\" features the sitter cloaked in yards of black-and-white plaid, with an enigmatic expression. As Grace Conkling wrote in her poem, <i>To the Lady in the Checkered Dress</i>, \"Mona Lisa so would smile!\"<br><br>Zorach was an American Fauvist painter, designer, and textile artist from Santa Rosa, California. In her portrait, she sits in her studio, palette and brushes at her right hand, one of her paintings dated 1910 on the wall, wearing an imaginative garment likely of her own design. Zorach began to explore batik and embroidery after the birth of her second child and used the textile medium to explore Fauvist and non-narrative expression."
