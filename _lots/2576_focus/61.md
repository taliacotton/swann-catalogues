  a variety of material, including: a group photo signed by all sitters of Cheney''s
  husband Dr. Alexander Lambert (1861-1939) and the all-male staff of the American
  Red Cross''s civilian relief corps; a signed photograph of Dr. Lambert in uniform
  dated 1917; Cheney''s signed American Red Cross Women''s War Relief Corps in France
  registration, with photo attached; three identity cards with photos used in-country
  by Cheney during the war; approximately twenty individual photographs of women on
  Cheney''s staff, including several showing them at work in their offices; approximately
  fourteen blank documents generated and used by the Women''s War Relief Corps; Cheney''s
  Foreign Service Certificate; two letters thanking Cheney for her service upon her
  departure from France in 1919 typed and signed by her superiors at the American
  Red Cross; approximately twenty-seven period photographs showing the destruction
  done to Paris by German bombs, many by Maurice-Louis Branger (1874-1950); Barrecchia''s
  large folding 1918 map, <i>The Western Theatre of the European War</i>;  [together
  with] a typewritten account written by Cheney describing her time in Paris; a carbon
  of a typed account of a voyage through France after the Armistice written by one
  of Lambert''s male colleagues; [and] some other related ephemera; including a letter
  from Harriet Chalmers Bliss Ford (1876-1964) dated 1952, sent along to a descendant
  of Cheney and Lambert explaining the scrapbook''s contents and captions, as she
  was the original compiler; the album pages extremely chipped and chipping, most
  material described above mounted on album pages could be removed by a qualified
  conservator; 12 1/2 x 9 in. overall<br><br>In her typed narrative of seven pages,
  Cheney provides great detailed descriptions of her work, including descriptions
  of its offices, organizational systems (forms, ID cards, interview processes, job
  assignment strategy), growth (they need larger offices and were forced to move more
  than once), challenges (spies, young women with no skills, rich heiresses who wanted
  to look important), and successes (placing the right person in the right job, and
  serving the cause while helping women earn money in respectable pursuits). She also
  mentions many of those who served by name, French and Americans alike.<br><br>She
  writes, "I feel as if I ought to say something about deserted Paris at the time
  of the near approach of the Germans, when we had air raids by night and Bertha by
  day, and knew that if the enemy got a very few miles nearer we might all have to
  be evacuated at a moment''s notice. We made light of it at the time, and there was
  very little panic, but thousands and thousands of rich and poor departed for the
  Provinces, and the streets and shops were deserted, the schools closed, and only
  those who had business to keep them, or nowhere to go, remained behind."<br><br>As
  this account is presumed unpublished, and not much has been written regarding the
  work of the Corps, this scrapbook should prove an important source of primary historical
  material.<br><br>Harriet Bliss Ford was asked to accompany her husband to France
  as well. The two women met on the steamer and worked closely together, with Bliss
  Ford as Cheney''s assistant. They lived at the HÃ´tel de France et Choiseul for the
  eighteen months of their service. Bliss Ford was graduated from Smith College in
  1899, served as an editor at the Century Magazine, and on the board of trustees
  of her Alma Mater.'
