year: 1882
CROSSHEAD: ''
TYPESET: 'Photographic portrait of the author and Sir Leslie Stephen (1832-1904) taken
  by George Charles Beresford (1864-1938) in 1902; the two subjects looking in the
  same direction, with Woolf in a three-quarter view, her father in profile; with
  Beresford''s 20 Yeoman''s Row Brompton Road stamp on the verso of the mount, sepia-toned
  platinotype on paper, mounted to the original khaki-colored board along the top
  edge verso of the photograph; chipped with loss to bottom left corner of the image,
  some very narrow marginal surface loss along top and bottom edges;  the image 4
  1/4 x 6 in.; the mount 8 x 6 1/4 in.<br><br>Woolf''s relationship with her father
  was fraught. She speculated that he "would have blushed with pride," when she was
  offered the same Clark lectureship in 1932 that he held in 1883, and she also noted
  that had he lived longer, "his life would have entirely ended mine. What would have
  happened? No writing, not books;-- inconceivable." (See Hill, Katherine C. “Virginia
  Woolf and Leslie Stephen: History and Literary Revolution.” PMLA, vol. 96, no. 3,
  1981, pp. 351–362. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/461911. Accessed 12 Apr. 2021.)'
