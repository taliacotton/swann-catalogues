[...] If however, in a Leslie Ford story I wrote, 'It is I,' said the police sergeant, I would be doing it to indicate that the speaker used a pedantic or pretentious kind of speech. Such people don't talk that way.\" She goes on to cite several references in support of her points, each sheet, 7 3/4 x 5 1/4 in.<br><br>Brown was a crime fiction writer who wrote under the names David Frome, Leslie Ford, and Brend Conrad. Her series featuring the characters Grace Latham and John Primrose were among her most popular."
