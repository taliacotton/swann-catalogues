  in a very good to excellent state of preservation; some foxing to contents, pencil
  signature to half-title, 6 1/2 x 4 1/4 in.<br><br>Montez''s factual biography reads
  like fiction. She was born Eliza Rosanna Gilbert in County Limerick, and spent her
  early years between India and the U.K. She was dancing professionally at the age
  of sixteen. Montez had affairs with Franz Liszt, Alexander Dumas, and others. As
  a performer, she most likely engaged in sex work as well; in polite society she
  was described as a courtesan. Her power in this position reaches its apex in Munich,
  where she wielded great influence over King Ludwig I of Bavaria as his mistress.
  Between 1846 and 1848, her role in the court caused rather profound political upheaval,
  ultimately resulting in Ludwig''s abdication from the throne. Marriages, affairs,
  and controversy came and went in subsequent years as Montez traveled to Australia
  and the United States, performing and dancing professionally. Montez is buried in
  Brooklyn, where she succumbed to syphilis in January of 1861. Aspects of her story
  have been portrayed in many period and modern films and novels, and she may be the
  inspiration for Conan Doyle''s Irene Adler. At the time of her death, Lola Montez
  was thirty-nine years old.'
