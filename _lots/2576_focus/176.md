  Collective posters appeared in peoples'' homes, women''s liberation offices, coffee
  shops, women''s centers, women''s health clinics, labor unions, and even on the
  set of a popular TV sitcom. All work was done in teams of 2-4 women led by an artist-designer.
  The Collective wanted a new feminist art that transcended the highly individualistic
  ''Great Men of Art'' syndrome. Members would propose a poster idea and then recruit
  a team to actually produce it. This method incorporated the vision of the individual
  artist into the collective art process. Thousands of posters were distributed worldwide
  during the Collective''s 13-year history from 1970-1983. Today some of their best
  efforts are considered classics of feminist poster art." (Estelle Carol, founding
