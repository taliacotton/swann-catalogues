  S. Thomas grew up in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. She married Samuel J. Elder in
  1876, and the two lived in Winchester, Massachusetts. Lilla was also a poet, <i>Lilacs
  in the Wood</i>, was published by her friends and family after she passed away at
  the age of 53. The Vassar Archive holds her college diary, in which she wrote as
  an undergraduate between 1866 and 1873. In it, she records details about her college
  experience. "The diary ends with her thoughts on how her Vassar education developed
  her character but had a negative effect on her romantic relationships with men."

  notable Vassar graduate of 1873 is Ella Weed (1853-1894), whose photograph is signed
  on the verso of the mount. Weed served as Chairman of the Academic Committee of
  the Board of Trustees of Barnard College during the first five years of its existence,
  and was the author of <i>A Foolish Virgin,</i> a satirical novel published in 1883
  about a Vassar graduate who fears revealing her intelligence and higher education
  "in order to meet accepted standards for female behavior." "Her policies at Barnard
  were the practical expression of her belief that women could gain full intellectual
  standing only if their education were equal to men''s in rigor." (cf. James, Edward
  T.; James, Janet Wilson, eds. (1974), "Weed, Ella", quotes from entry by Annette
  K. Baxter in <i>Famous American Women: a biographical dictionary</i>, Harvard University
  Press, pp. 556â€“7)'
