at-a-glance: ''
footnote_provenance: 'In this striking self-portrait Frances Benjamin Johnston''s
  confidence, subversion of norms, and energetic presence are keenly demonstrated
  throughout the composition. Her crossed ankle, angled openly towards the viewer
  and revealing bright petticoats and tight-clad leg, beer stein, and stylized handling
  of her cigarette, all show a woman in full control of herself and her medium. Above
  her, portraits of men (some identifiable) she photographed decorate the mantle,
  a collection of objects that declare her success and highlight her gender.<br><br>In
  1894, just two years prior to making this image, Johnston was described as "the
  only lady in the business of photography in the city" by the  The Washington Times.  And
  clearly, she was conscious of her role as a pioneer for women in photography, telling
  a reporter in 1893, “It is another pet theory with me that there are great possibilities
  in photography as a profitable and pleasant occupation for women, and I feel that
  my success helps to demonstrate this, and it is for this reason that I am glad to
  have other women know of my work.” Johnston was one of the first female press photographers
  in the United States, one of the first women to enjoy a long successful career as
  a photographer, recording and reporting on events, making portraits of celebrities,
  Presidents in the White House, and more. She documented architecture, advocating
  for preservation of historical buildings, and and earned widespread recognition
  and fame for her work. But, Johnston was not part of artistic circles, and fell
  out of memory after her death.<br><br>Years later, Lincoln Kirstein discovered a
  bound album of Johnston''s photographs made at the Hampton Institute, a preparatory
  and trade school for African American and Native American students. Kirsten gave
  the album to the Museum of Modern Art, which identified and reproduced the images
  in a 1966 book. These images have helped bring her back to the public eye.<br><br>Smock
