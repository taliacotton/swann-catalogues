CROSSHEAD: "Three albums with nearly 400 photographs of machinery from the Consolidated Machine Tool Corporation of America, Rochester, New York."
TYPESET: "The photographs highlight the machines produced by the company, either in silhouetted imagery with gleaming surfaces or arranged in their environs with a cloth backdrop. Some showmen working at the machines \"in situ,\" or just their hands operating the specific tools. The captions on verso often describe the technical specs of the machine as well as who it was manufactured for. One album (with about half of the photographs) focuses largely specific segments of machines, including \"Modern Inserted Blade Face Milling Cutters.\" Silver prints, most of the images measuring approximately 9½x7½ inches (24.1x19.1 cm.), the sheets slightly larger, and the reverse, some slightly smaller, many with typed captions, including technical details and a date, but the smallest album also with captions in blue pencil, on verso. 4tos, leatherette, two with gilt-lettered titles; two with three ring bindings inside and one a twin-bolt binding. 1920s-40s"
