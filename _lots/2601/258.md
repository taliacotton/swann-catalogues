DESCRIPT: "(TRAVEL ALBUM)"
CROSSHEAD: "A wide-ranging album with more than 160 images that follows travels as widespread as Hawaii, California, and Cuba."
TYPESET: "The album focuses on California, the Pacific Coast, Utah, Colorado, Hawaii, Florida, Cuba, and the Bahamas, including images of Pasadena, Mount Lowe, Pacific Coast, north to Columbia River, surfing and hula in Hawaii, Yosemite, the Morman Tabernacle and Salt Lake City, St. Augustine and Palm Beach, Nassau Bay, and Cuba. The photographs appear to be both from professional studios and amateur imagery (including some from the travelers themselves), and feature many interesting themes including Native Americans, Black Americans, railroads, steamships, industry, and agriculture, highlighting a now largely disappeared natural landscape and its inhabitants. Albumen, printing-out paper, silver prints, and colorized reproductions (16), the images measuring 3⅛ inches square to 7¾x9½ inches (7.9 to 19.7x24.1 cm.), mounted recto/verso, some with captions in the negative and others with captions in ink. Thick oblong folio, black cloth; tied binding. Circa 1898"

Photochrome Co., California – 1898, (one), Waters, California, (2), Motts, California (one). Davey Photo Co., Hawaii, (28), and J.F. Coonley, Nassau (11 or 12)."
