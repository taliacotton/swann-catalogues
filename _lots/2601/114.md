footnote_provenance: "George Krause studied painting, drawing, sculpture, and photography at the Philadelphia College of Art. In the 1950s, he turned fully to photography, spending his free time (he was serving in the Army) to documenting the culture of the black neighborhoods in the racially segregated communities of South Carolina. In 1959 he returned to his hometown Phildelphia, continuing this social documentary work. In 1960, Edward Steichen acquired a photograph for the Museum of Modern Art, and in 1963 Art in America selected Krause as the only photographer for its \"Young Talen Award USA.\" John Szarkowski included his work in exhibitions, and added more works to MoMA's collection. Krause received the first Prix de Rome and the first Fulbright grant ever awarded to a photographer, two Guggenheim Fellowships, and three grants from the National Endowment for the Arts."
