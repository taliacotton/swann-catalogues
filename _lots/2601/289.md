footnote_provenance: "This image was included in a  LIFE  magazine article featuring Robert Capa's images, including on the cover on May 16, 1938:\n\"China puts the Japanese Army on the Run - A Unified Nation Reverses its War\nFortunes.\" The feature article includes Robert Capa's cover, plus twenty-three additional images, including \"The Coming Generation,\" pages 11-17. The actual caption beneath this image was as follows: \"Scouts see Soldiers to War. Note the\nintense concentration of the faces of these Chinese Boy Scouts. They are listening to Tsao Li-Tse, China's Minister of Propaganda. He is telling them that upon their and their elder brothers in college, falls the job of stiffening China's phlegmatic millions into relentless resistance to Japan. The date is late March; the place Hankow; the occasion, a farewell demonstration for soldiers wounded at Shanghai, now recovered and returning to the front. Before long these boys may be marching to the front themselves. Many of China's recruits, like the soldier on the Cover, are only 14 to 18 years old (A Defender of China).\""
