Hunter, Jr., acquired at Swann Galleries, October 5, 2018<br><br>Romare Bearden's <i>Obeah</i> watercolors are an important series in the artist's late career. They represent both a culmination of his artistic freedom and expression in the medium, and his awareness of the traditions of his second home on the Caribbean island of St. Martin. The role of the Obeah is a well-known part of Afro-Caribbean communities and cultural history - typically, a woman who practices spiritual, herbal and mystical healing in her villlage."
