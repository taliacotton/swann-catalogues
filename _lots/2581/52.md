A very good impression of this scarce, important print, with vibrant colors.<br><br>From 1957 to 1963, Blackburn served as the first master printer at Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE), West Islip, NY. In most cases, he taught the artists, including Jim Dine, Helen Frankenthaler, Jasper Johns, and Robert Rauschenberg, how to make lithographs, sharing his sensibility of the medium and his approach to the stone. In 1963, Blackburn began to operate his workshop full time, providing an open studio for artists of diverse social and economic backgrounds, styles, and levels of expertise. Under his direction, the Printmaking Workshop became one of the most vital collaborative art studios in the world."
