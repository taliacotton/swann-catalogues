DESCRIPT: SIMONE LEIGH (1967 - )
CROSSHEAD: Untitled.
year: 2011
TYPESET: 'Glazed salt-fired stoneware, circa 2011-12. 216x381x178 mm; 8½x15x7 inches.<br><br>Provenance:
  acquired directly from the artist; private collection, New York.<br><br>Simone Leigh''s
  cowrie shell is an excellent example of one of her signature sculptural forms. Each
  of her cowrie shells is unique - this work is covered in raised black dots of glaze
  with a golden iridescent glaze from the salt added to the kiln. The tactile surface
  is only disrupted by the jagged opening to the interior of this evocative form.<br><br>Simone
  Leigh began making these cowrie shells in 2011. They have been both exhibited as
  individual works and part of larger sculptures and installations. These forms were
  first publicly exhibited at the Studio Museum in Harlem during Simone Leigh''s 2010-11
  residency, then again in her 2011 solo exhibition <i>You Don’t Know Where Her Mouth
  Has Been</i> at the Kitchen, New York. The exhibition featured the same-titled installation
  of 65 cowrie shells hanging by wire as a chandelier.'
