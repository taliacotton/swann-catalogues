DESCRIPT: ELIZABETH CATLETT  (1915 - 2012)
CROSSHEAD: Head.
year: 1943
TYPESET: 'Carved limestone, 1943. Approximately 343x241x184 mm; 13½x9½x7¼ inches.
  Incised initials at rear lower edge.<br><br>Provenance: Charles White, New York;
  private collection, New York; thence by descent, private collection, New Jersey.<br><br>This
  impressive carving of a young man''s head is an important sculpture by Elizabeth
  Catlett. It is one of only two known stone sculptures made by the artist, and the
  only work from her seminal 1940s period whose location is known today. The only
  other recorded stone work is <i>Mother and Child</i>, her 1940 University of Iowa
  MFA thesis project. The 35 inch high carving in limestone is now sadly missing from
  the University''s collection. In Samella Lewis''s monograph, <i>The Art of Elizabeth
  Catlett</i>, Lewis catalogued just two works for the year 1943: "<i>Abstract Forms</i>,
  plaster" and "<i>Head</i>, stone". Catlett primarily worked in plaster and terracotta
  in the late 1930s and 1940s. All four works included in her <i>I am the Negro Woman</i>
  solo exhibition at the Barnett-Aden Gallery in 1947, <i>Negro Woman</i>, <i>Tired</i>,
  <i>Pensive</i> and <i>Frustration</i>, were terra cotta.<br><br>Elizabeth Catlett''s
  <i>Head</i> stone shows her synthesis of her studies and interest in depicting modern
  African American subjects in the early 1940s. Melanie Herzog describes Catlett''s
  education at the University of Iowa, and how in her second year of graduate studies,
  she focused on sculpture - learning several techniques in bronze, stone, wood, terra
  cotta and plaster. But it was <i>Mother and Child</i>, the centerpiece of her 1940
  thesis project, that crystallized many of her interests; as Catlett wrote in her
  thesis, "stone imposes a certain discipline which cannot be ignored." Her work won
  First Award in Sculpture in the 1940 American Negro Exhibition in Chicago, and caught
  the interest of James A. Porter who included an image and description of <i>Mother
  and Child</i> in his 1943 <i>Modern Negro Art</i>. Porter wrote "it is a pity that
  this young woman has had so few opportunities to continue her work in stone." In
  1942, Herzog describes how after moving to New York, Catlett also studied with the
  French-Russian emigre and modernist sculptor Ossip Zadkine - taking private lessons
  from him that summer, while working in terra cotta. Zadkine was also a stone carver,
  and helped her develop a modernist sense of abstraction in her work by simplifying
  the forms of the human figure. <i>Head</i> displays Catlett''s emerging modern approach
  to an African-American subjects in the 1940s. Herzog pp. 19-21, 30-34; Porter p.
  132; Lewis p. 188.'
