  important and powerful anti-war artwork by Timothy Washington is one of the first
  and the largest of his ground breaking early works on aluminum. At the age of twenty,
  Timothy Washington pioneered his innovative technique in the later part of 1967.
  Washington describes the special circumstances of this important creative moment
  in the catalogue essay by Joseph Young of <em>Three Graphic Artists</em>: <br><br>"I
  was in class, and our problem was to do something that we would consider very personal.
  And I think it was the very same day that I went home and found that I was reclassified
  for the draft as 1-A. So, I knew that I was going to make something relating to
  the army or war. l wanted to work on a substance that was cold and hard, and I thought
  of aluminum as a material that I would like to work on. The first piece that I did
  on aluminum was a triptych which was a social commentary against wars."<br><br>The
  artist spray painted the aluminum plates with black enamel paint, and then incised
  the imagery with an engraving tool - similar to a mezzotint or a scratchboard. The
  Los Angeles native had not yet graduated from the Chouinard Art Institute - he received
  his BFA in 1969. Eleven of these works were included in the 1971 ground-breaking
  LACMA exhibition <em>Three Graphic Artists</em> when the young artists Washington
  and David Hammons exhibited alongside Charles White. Washington continued to exhibit
  his assemblage work, drawings and sculpture at the Brockman Gallery, Gallery 32
  and Wylan Gallery in Los Angeles through the 1970s.<br><br>Today the significance
  of this body of work is widely recognized. Washington''s work was included in the
  influential 2011 Tilton Gallery exhibition <em>L. A. Object &amp; David Hammons
  Body Prints </em>and the 2012 traveling museum exhibition <em>Now Dig This! Art
  &amp; Black Los Angeles 1960-1980. T</em>he Los Angeles artist had his first solo
  museum exhibition <em>Love Thy Neighbor </em>at the California Craft &amp; Folk
  Art Museum in 2014. More recently, Washington''s artwork was featured in the 2017-2020
  important traveling museum exhibition <em>Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black
  Power organized by the Tate Modern.</em></p>'
