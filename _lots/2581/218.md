Using a grid as a framework to create his compositons, Mack creates intricate collages from graphic images before handcoloring. This early work of Mack shows how he investigates multi-media as the springboard for his practice.<br><br>Today Eric Mack creates mathematically based renderings with a distinctly post-modern approach. His multimedia artworks are informed with superimposed grids, patterns, and portals. Layered surfaces are created with paint, found objects, natural fibers, and synthetic substrates that explore the systems of our visual world.
