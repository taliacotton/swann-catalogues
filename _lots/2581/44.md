  private collection, New York; Beverly Sacks Fine Art, New York, with the gallery
  label on the frame back; private collection, Los Angeles.<br><br>Exhibited: <em>Paintings
  by Hale Woodruff</em>, Bertha Schaefer Gallery, New York, September 15 - October
  4, 1958. This was the third of Woodruff''s solo exhibitions at the Bertha Schaefer
  Gallery of the 1950s which established his New York career as a significant abstract
  artist.<br><br>With its gorgeous jewel-like colors and rich painterly passages,
  <em>Carnival</em> is an excellent and important example of Hale Woodruff''s postwar
  abstraction, and his largest abstract canvas to come to auction. <em>Carnival</em>
  is part of Woodruff 1950s body of work in which describes landscape and natural
  phenomena within the idiom of Abstract Expressionism.<br><br>Not seen publicly in
  over seventy years, this striking canvas shows Woodruff''s continued evolution as
  an abstract painter in the postwar period. By the late 1950s, now a Professor of
  art education at New York University and an important member of the New York School,
  Woodruff showed more freedom in his approach, in both color and brushwork. <em>Carnival</em>
  is related in palette and composition to another large, vertical canvas <em>Blue
  Intrusion</em>, 1958, in the collection of New York University and the smaller <em>Red
  Landscape, </em>1957 (sold at Swann Galleries on Feb. 14, 2013) - both were included
  with <em>Carnival </em>in his 1958 solo exhibition at Bertha Schaefer Gallery. Dore
  Ashton in her New York Times review wrote: (Woodruff''s) "large abstractions are
  often based on impressions of landscape. They are done with emphatic, broad strokes,
  and colors are bright and cleanly handled. The free swinging brush movements have
  enabled Woodruff to clarify his ideas of the implied movements of nature - hills,
  trees, sky." Additionally, Arts magazine review of his exhibition mentioned Carnival
  as one of his large paintings which engage on the level of its title "with an excitement,
  rhythm, progression of swift angular, broken shapes and beautiful color". Woodruff
  continued to use landscape as the structure of his abstract painting through the
  late 1960s - see in such later works as <em>Primordial Landscape</em>, 1967, (sold
  at Swann Galleries on April 22, 2021) with similar jewel-like colors.</p>'
