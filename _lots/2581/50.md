  post war painting, including receiving the Emily Lowe Memorial award for his painting
  An Ancient Place, and a solo exhibition at Feingarten Galleries, New York in April
  of that year. Alston included in his Feingarten exhibition a group of 1958-60 abstract
  paintings with several similar compositions, including his 1960 <em>Composition
  #1</em>, sold at Swann Galleries on April 4, 2018. In <em>Moon Haze</em>, Alston
  masterfully creates a subtle, hazy atmosphere of thin layers of silvery grey paint
  which blurs boundaries. Bearden/Henderson, Jr., p. 269; Wardlaw p. 91 and 93.</p>'
