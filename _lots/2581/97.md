  landscape painting with similar dramatic depictions of natural phenomena, including
  his well known <em>Gathering Storm Over Philadelphia</em>, circa 1961, collection
  of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia. Here Sloan uses the
  swirling stormy clouds to incorporate a dramatic range of painting handling and
  colors; using a variety of of brushwork, drips and splatter in a plethora of greys,
  purples and blues. This is the largest and most significant painting by the artist
  to come to auction since artist's Self-Portrait, 1956, sold at Swann Galleries on
