Signed, dated and inscribed \"Artist's Proof\" in pencil, lower edge verso. From the artist's <i>The Louisiana Project</i> series.<br><br>In 2003, the Newcomb Art Gallery at Tulane University commissioned Carrie Mae Weems to create a work in response to the bicentennial of the Louisiana Purchase. Consisting of more than seventy separate photographs and screenprints, a video, and a live performance by the artist at its debut, <i>The Louisiana Project</i> examines both the distant past of slaveholding, antebellum Louisiana and the state’s recent present, characterized by the economic crisis and racial segregation. <i>The Louisiana Project</i> juxtaposes the secrecy that surrounds the Rex Ball, an exclusive event attended by members of New Orleans’s white upper class, and the not-so-secret sexual liaisons had by the male scions of these elite families with African American women from the adjacent community of the <i>gens du coleur</i> throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."
