  playing cards. The artist exhibited an installation of this series at DC Moore Gallery

  of round cards which is in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian's National
  Museum of African American History and Culture, Washington, DC.<br><br>These drawings
  are excellent examples of Whitfield Lovell's portraiture--images drawn from a personal
  archive of approximately 600 studio photographs of anonymous African Americans,
  most dating from the Emancipation Proclamation to the Civil Rights movement. Lovell
  often combines them with everyday found objects like playing cards, fabric fragments
  and other vintage objects that examine narratives and themes about family, identity,
  gender, love, loss, and the passage of time. Lovell first used such drawings on
  wood panels in a series of large installations, which gained national acclaim. His
  work is found in numerous institutional collections including the Metropolitan Museum
  of Art, the National Museum of American Art, Washington, DC, the Seattle Art Museum,
  the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Yale University Art Gallery."
