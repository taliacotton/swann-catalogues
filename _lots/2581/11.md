DESCRIPT: RICHMOND BARTHÉ (1901 - 1989)
CROSSHEAD: Feral Benga.

TYPESET: 'Bronze with a dark brown patina, modeled in 1935, cast circa 1960. Approximately
  483 mm; 19 inches high (not including the marble base). Cast by the Modern Art Foundry,
  Long Island City, NY. Signed at the base edge.<br><br>Provenance: the artist; Samella
  Lewis, Los Angeles; Dr. Linda F. Rankin, New Jersey (1988); William Watson Hines
  III, thence by descent, private collection, New Jersey. Hines was a business writer,
  art dealer and collector who lent many works from his collection to the Art In Embassies
  Program of the US State Department.<br><br>Illustrated: Cedric Dover. <i>American
  Negro Art</i>, plate 70 (another impression).<br><br><i>Feral Benga</i> represents
  the culmination of Richmond Barthé''s study of the figure in sculpture, anatomy
  and dance in the 1930s, and his pioneering realization of an ideal male nude. According
  to Barthé scholar Margaret Rose Vendryes, <i>Feral Benga</i>, Barthé''s "signature
  piece," was completed within a few months of seeing the Folies Bergères dancer Benga
  perform on stage during his first visit to Paris in 1934. Vendryes describes how
  Benga was an exotic celebrity--a Senegalese cabaret dancer known in Parisian and
  Manhattan gay circles, who had perfomed on stage with Josephine Baker and had even
  appeared in a Jean Cocteau surrealist film. Barthé used postcards, photographs and
  his memory to recreate a life-like representation of the dancer. The raised sword
  pose also recalls the muscular nudes of the famous Mannerist engraving by Antonio
  Pollaiuolo, <i>Battle of Naked Men<D>, circa 1470.<br><br>Grander in scale than
  its actual size, <i>Feral Benga</i> was one ot the artist''s major achievements
  in his life-long body of work, a natural and sensual repesentation of the male nude,
  made at the height of his career. The sculpture was first shown at the 1937 <i>Dance
  International<D> exhibition at Rockefeller Center, and was later featured and illustrated
  in Alain Locke''s seminal survey, <i>The Negro in Art.</i>The figure is also important
  as a groundbreaking evocation of both male and homosexual sexuality in early 20th
  century American Art.<br><br>Thank you to Margaret Vendryes for her assistance with
  the cataloguing of this cast. This is only the second mid-career cast of this bronze
  sculpture to come to auction--there are only two bronzes known to exist from the
  first 1935 casting. Under the supervision of the artist and the Richmond Barthé
  Trust, an edition of 10 numbered casts and a small number of artist''s proofs of
  <i>Feral Benga</i> were made in 1986. Vendryes pp. 66-69.'
