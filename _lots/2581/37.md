TYPESET: "Tempera on cream wove paper, 1949. 610x457 mm; 24x18 inches. Signed and dated in red ink, lower right recto. Titled in blue ink, lower left verso.<br><br>Provenance; private collection, Massachusetts.<br><br>This remarkable and very scarce work on paper is from John Wilson's time in Paris, and is unequivocally inspired by Fernand Léger. In 1947, John Wilson won the James William Paige Traveling Fellowship from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and moved to Paris, where he worked in Fernand Léger’s studio. Wilson adapted many of his mentor's modern techniques of abstracting forms, developed more modernist compositions, and added to the social and political consciousness of his art. After returning to the US in 1950, Wilson earned the John Hay Whitney Fellowship and moved to Mexico City."
