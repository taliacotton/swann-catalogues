DESCRIPT: SIMONE LEIGH (1967 -   )

year: 2004
TYPESET: "<p>Glazed Terra cotta stoneware, circa 2004. Approximately 483x558x558 mm;
  19x22x22 inches.<br><br>Provenance: acquired directly from the artist; private collection.<br><br>This
  vessel is an excellent, early example of the Leigh's work in salt-fired stoneware
  in which she explores the imagery of the black female body, the romanticization
  of primitivism and fertility. Leigh has often explored the experiences and social
  histories of black women through ceramics for over 25 years. Her work in ceramic
  makes multi-layered references to African traditions, feminism, ethnographic research,
  postcolonial theory and racial politics.<br><br>Simone Leigh created a related vessel
  in black, entitled <em>Pitch, </em>pictured in the data base of the Elizabeth A.
  Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. A similar vessel in white
  was sold at Sotheby's New York on September 26, 2019.</p>"
