Driskell Center, University of Maryland, College Park.<br><br>Master printer, painter, educator and administrator Curlee Raven Holton has developed a thought-provoking practice that confronts the limitations of the lived experience. Holton's extensive career and decades of experience allow him to address contemporary issues both within his artistic and scholarly work. His prints have been exhibited at Egypt’s 7th International Biennale; Taller de Artes Plásticas Rufino Tamayo, Oaxaca, Mexico; the Cleveland Museum of Art. Cultural and self-reflective, his works are compelling narratives of the past, present, and the overlapping of the two.<br><br>Holton is also known for his work with other artists - creating collaborative initiatives to spark productions in printmaking. He founded the Experimental Printmaking Institute (EPI) which focuses on community outreach and supporting student artists in 1996 at Lafayette College, Pennsylvania. The EPI studio allows students to shadow practicing artists such as Faith Ringgold in the production of her print editions. Currently, Holton is the director of the David C. Driskell Center for the Visual Arts and Culture of African Americans and the African Diaspora at the University of Maryland. Holton is also master printer and director of the fine art press Raven Editions in Easton, Pennsylvania."
