  Corrine Jennings and Roger H. King, Jr. <i>Edward M. Bannister 1828 - 1901: A Centennial
  Retrospective</i>, p. 23.<br><br>This landscape is an excellent example of Edward
  M. Bannister''s mature landscape painting, representing both the natural beauty
  of rural Rhode Island and man''s place in it. Bannister began to explore more atmospheric
  and tonal painterly effects in his late 1880s and early 1890s landscapes. His <i>Crossing
  the Bridge Before Sunset<i> displays a beautiful overall golden hue and painterliness;
  the fading light of the day, filtered through an atmospheric sky, traverses a rich
  and verdant countryside. Bannister draws the viewer into the scene by placing the
  horse drawn cart moving into the center of the composition.'
