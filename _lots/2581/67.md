TYPESET: "Color screenprint on brown wove paper, 1968. 647x622 mm; 25½x24½ inches, full margins. From the edition of fewer than 10 impressions printed by the artist. Signed in pencil, lower right.<br><br>Provenance: estate of the artist; private collection.<br><br>A very scarce print which includes powerful imagery of the swastika and the white stars of the US flag as robed Klu Klux Klan members. In an interview with Rebecca Zorach and Skyla Hearn, published online for the archival project <i>Never The Same</i>, Jones-Hogu described her choice of this imagery: \"The swastika is used to represent racism, governmental control, oppression, suppression, and fascism it is used in several of my images...I feel that racism and fascism played a great deal in my father being successful or not successful in his life, so some of these prints’ ideas and content deal with the fact that we and he were not really free to do whatever we and he really wanted to do and could do due to radical oppression and suppression..\" She used similar imagery in her 1968 prints<i>Land Where My Father Died</i> and <i>Be Your Brother's Keeper</i>."
