After winning a 4 year scholarship to the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art., he was supported by Dr. Albert C. Barnes, who gave him access to his famous collection at the Barnes Foundation from 1939-1944.  In 1944, his painting <i>Cutting Pattern</i> was just the second art work by an African-American artist accepted into the Barnes Foundation, after one by Horace Pippin. Clark also was a colleague of Dox Thrash and Rayond Steth in the WPA Printmaking Workshop from 1939-1942, where he helped Thrash develop his innovative carborundum etching technique. Clark's paintings and prints are in many institutional collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Saint Louis Art Museum, the Newark Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, and the De Young Museum.
