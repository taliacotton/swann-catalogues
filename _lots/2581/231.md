He was the co-founder of Aljira, a Center for Contemporary Art, with artist Carl  E. Hazlewood in Newark, NJ, in 1983, and served as its founding director until 2016. His work is heavily influenced by the anti-colonial politics of the Caribbean, and by the intellectual powerhouses of that period. These include extraordinary writers and activists like Martin Carter, Frantz Fanon and Walter Rodney. Since 1996, his series of paintings and drawings, including this series of paintings on album covers, are his attempt as an artist to negotiate the roots of identity in a terrain of loss and desire. He lives and works in West Orange, NJ."
