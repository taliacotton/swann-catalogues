year: 1975
TYPESET: 'Oil on linen canvas, circa 1975. 813x660 mm; 32x26 inches. Signed in oil,
  lower right.<br><br>Provenance: private collection, Florida.<br><br>This untitled
  urban landscape is a very fine example of Hughie Lee-Smith''s painting, a transitional
  work between his "metaphysical phase" of the 1960s and his late period body of work
  of the 80s and 90s. Despite the painting''s intense, bright light, the subject of
  a dilapidated Victorian building recalls Lee-Smith''s earlier and darker 1950s paintings.
  The only sign of a recent human presence is a single blue balloon, also abandoned
  and left on the street.<br><br>Detroit photographer J. Edward Bailey III''s (1923-1982),
  <i>Portrait of Hughie Lee-Smith</i>, 1975, in the collection of Wayne State University,
  captures Lee-Smith painting a scene in front of a similar landscape of abandoned
  houses. Lee-Smith continued to paint urban scenes that harken back not just to Detroit,
  but his life in Cleveland during the Depression. Here Lee-Smith shows a singular
  economy and clarity in his vision. With little drama, he evokes the existentialism
  of the 1970s --the deterioration of America''s historic urban areas and communities
  during periods of great growth and prosperity in the country at large.'
