Signed and dated in ink, lower left corner.<br><br>Provenance: collection of the artist.<br><br>Since the beginning of Floyd Newsum's career, he has painted on paper. His painterly approach is to create tactile surfaces and colors of paint on multiple papers forming one composition. Refining several systems of cultural and abstract symbols in his work, Newsum reflects on his background and history - his latest works show the influence of West African art. Newsum has said \"I want to to provoke thought or conjecture from the viewer. My paintings are a collection of thoughts in a single composition, with the power to present more than one interpretation.\"<br><br>A native of Memphis, Tennessee, Floyd Newsum graduated from Memphis College of Art with a BFA in 1973 and from Temple University, Philadelphia with an MFA in 1975. A painter and printmaker, he has taught art for 38 years at the University of Houston, and has exhibited his work in more than 78 solo and group exhibitions in museums and galleries across the country. Newsum has also created five public art projects, four of which are in Houston and one in Fort Worth. His works are in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Washington, DC, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art."
