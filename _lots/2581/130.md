  of Anne & Allan Edmunds.<br><br>Belkis Ayón (1967-1999) was an Afro-Latina printmaker
  and professor born in Havana, Cuba. Ayón is best known for her innovations in collagraphy.
  Ayón studied engraving at the prestigious Instituto Superior de Arte in Havana (ISA)
  and joined its faculty after graduation. Much of what is being discovered and uncovered
  of her works are credited to her first US retrospective <i>Nkame: A Retrospective
  of Cuban Printmaker Belkis Ayón.</i> The exhibition not only revealed the mystical
  workings of a African religious society but also the gamut of Ayón’s artistry and
  investigative skills.<br><br>Ayón''s formative years as an artist were plagued by
  the <i>periodo especial</i> in Cuba which began with the collapse of the Soviet
  Union. This most difficult era in Cuba was a time when vital resources, let alone
  art supplies, were not readily accessible. However, this is also the time in which
  Ayón rose to prominence in the contemporary art world: Ayón’s work was exhibited
  at the 16th Venice Biennale, the Havana Biennial and the Bharat Bhavan International
  Biennial of Prints in India. In 1999 she was awarded four residencies including
  with the Brandywine Workshop, the Tyler School of Art at Temple University, the
  Bronski Center at the Philadelphia College of Art, and the Bensen Hall Gallery,
  Rhode Island School of Design. 1999 was also the year Ayón committed suicide, and
  left behind a body of work that has broken barriers between US-Cuban relations and
  has pioneered discourses regarding African iconography and influence on Cuban culture
  and society. Her sister Katia Ayón Manso is the representative of the Estate de
  Belkis Ayón, located at the Ayón family home in Central Havana where Ayón grew up.<br><br>After
  her untimely death at the age of 32, Belkis Ayón left behind an oeuvre that is important
  to the history of printmaking, traversing Cuban, contemporary art, and gender boundaries.
  Her unsettling subjects are typically depicted against stark black patterned backgrounds,
  as oblong almost shapeless silhouettes with hollow, almond-shaped eyes. Her body
  of work functions as a reflection on the mysticism and traditions of the secret
  religious Afro-Cuban brotherhood, Abakuá Secret Society. Described in the United
  States as "an Afro-Cuban version of Freemasonry," this fraternity was fathomed in
  Nigeria and founded by enslaved Africans in Cuba as a society of refuge against
  the backdrop of the vile institution of slavery. The esoteric practice is composed
  of the usage of a creolized African language, rituals and ceremonies, and involves
  many iconographic figures such as princess Sikán whom Ayón used as a vessel to investigate
  the society. She is quoted as saying, “They said [Abakuá] was a secret society,
  only for men, and that aroused [her] interest.” That interest was figuratively personified
  as princess Sikán who is recorded as the only female figure in Abakuá lore. Ayón''s
  inclusion of egalitarian iconography with the incorporation of princess Sikán not
  only supplanted the Abakuá Secret Society but refuted societal norms. She is known
  for having been the only and the most prominent figure with an extensive body of
  work that traverses and investigates the exclusive Abakuán brotherhood. Belkis Ayón
  was a master at her craft and a pioneer in the world of large-scale print installations
  and collographs, a labor-intensive art practice that cemented her place in today
  both in art history and the art world.'
