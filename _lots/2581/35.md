Signed in oil, lower right.<br><br>Provenance: acquired directly from the artist; Margradel and Leonard Hicks, New York (1960s); thence by descent, private collection, Vermont.<br><br>This elegant, modern painting is a very fine example of Norman Lewis's abstraction of the early 1950s. Lewis painted thinly on linen canvas to created subtle, atmospheric effects to represent natural phenomena. At the same time, in addition to his well-received 1950 and 1951 solo exhibitions at the Willard Gallery, Lewis began to achieve greater public recognition. He was included in the important 1951 group exhibition <i>Abstract Painting and Sculpture in America</i> exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York where his 1950 painting <i>Urban</i> was hung alongside works by Stuart Davis, Arshile Gorky and Man Ray. Fine p. 256."
