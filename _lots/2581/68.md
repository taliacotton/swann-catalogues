From the edition of 10 or fewer impressions printed by the artist.<br><br>Provenance: estate of the artist; private collection.<br><br>Exhibited: <i>Barbara Jones-Hogu: Resist, Relate, Unite,</i> DePaul Art Museum, Chicago, 2018.<br><br>Illustrated: <i>Barbara Jones-Hogu: Resist, Relate, Unite,</i> DePaul Art Museum, Chicago, p: 54.<br><br>This work is one of two different compositions that Jones-Hogu produced using this title. AfriCOBRA members typically produced individual works related to a group-determined theme. The <i>I'm Better Than These Motherfuckers</i> theme was too controversial for some members of the collective. Jones-Hogu produced two related prints, and co-founder Wadsworth Jarrell produced a painting using this title. Another impression of this work is in the collection of the Studio Museum in Harlem. The other, very different, screenprint that Jones-Hogu made using this title is in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. Both prints use the image of an African American woman on a beach with white sunbathers."
