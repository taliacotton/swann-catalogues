Signed and dated in pencil, verso.<br><br>Provenance: collection of the artist; private collection, New York; private collection.<br><br>Exhibited: The Project, New York, Feburary - March 2009.<br><br>Born in the Bronx in 1970 and raised in Cortland, New York, Kori Newkirk fuses art education with childhood memories, social and political commentary, and popular culture to create multimedia paintings, sculptural installations, and photographs that explore the formal properties of materials, the politics of identity, and the artist's personal history. He received a BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1993, an MFA from the University of California, Irvine in 1997, and attended Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 1997. Since then, he has lived and worked in Southern California.  From his signature lanscape works composed of plastic hair beads to the insertion of his body in social spaces and natural environments, his work reminds viewers of the isolation experienced by urban youth, the over-consumption of popular culture, and the experiences of African-American culture and life."
