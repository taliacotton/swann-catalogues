TYPESET: 'Oil on canvas, mounted on board, circa 1880-81. 248x229 mm; 9Â¾x9 inches.
  Signed in oil, lower left.<br><br>Provenance: the estate of the artist, with estate
  blue ink stamp and the ink signature of Jesse O. Tanner, on the frame back; Grand
  Central Art Galleries, New York, with the label on the frame back; the artist Harry
  Andrew Jackson; thence by descent, private collection, Wyoming.<br><br>Tanner painted
  <i>Head of a Sheep</i> early in his studies at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine
  Arts when he seized on the speciality of painting animals. With the support of his
  parents and inspiration from the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition, Henry Ossawa Tanner
  enrolled at the Academy in December of 1879. A year later he began life drawing
  classes under the tutelage of Thomas Eakins. After an interest in maritime painting,
  Tanner settled on painting animal subjects, with his stated desire "to become an
  American Landseer." According to Anna O. Marley, "Tanner was so devoted to animal
  painting that he bought a sheep to serve as a model for his pastoral compositions."
  This small study has clear ties in subject to Tanner''s 1881 <i>Boy and Sheep Under
  a Tree</I>. But its bold passages of painterly brushwork are closer to his naturalist
  study of lions, <i>Pomp at the Zoo</i>, circa 1880, and <i>Lion Licking its Paw</i>,
  1886. Marley p. 19; Mosby pp. 74-75.'
