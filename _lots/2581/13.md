  from the Harlem Renaissance era. James Lesesne Wells's early career as a printmaker
  is characterized by his easy mastery of block prints. Wells also was very successful
  in having this graphic work widely published in leading black periodicals like <i>The
  Crisis</i> and <i>Opportunity</i>; his illustrations accompanied the writing of
  the likes of writers Alain Locke, Marianne Moore, Willis Richardson and Carter Woodson.
