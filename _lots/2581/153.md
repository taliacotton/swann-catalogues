DESCRIPT: FAITH RINGGOLD (1930 - )
CROSSHEAD: No More War.
year: 1984
TYPESET: "<p>Color intaglio on wove paper, circa 1984-85. 603x895 mm; 23¾x35¼ inches,
  full margins. Signed and numbered 4/5 in pencil, lower margin. An excellent impression
  of this very scarce, large print.<br><br>Provenance: Peg Alston Fine Arts, New York;
  private collection, New York.<br><br>This large print is an interpretation of the
  central image of Faith Ringgold's 1985 Part I story quilt. Unlike the typically
  painted images of her story quilts, both parts of her <em>No More War Story Quilts</em>
  include intaglio-printed images in the central panel, creating an abstraction of
  fallen bodies in conflict.<br><br>In 1984, Ringgold first made a series of intaglio
  prints entitled <em>The Death of Apartheid</em> and <em>Women, Power, Poverty and
  Love</em>. She then continued printmaking as a Visiting Artist at Bob Blackburn’s
  Printmaking Workshop in New York where she developed a technique for etching on
  canvas that would be used to make the <em>No More War Story Quilts</em> the following
  year. Farrington p. 108.</p>"
