  full margins. Signed and numbered 4/5 in pencil, lower margin. An excellent impression
  of this very scarce, large print.<br><br>Provenance: Peg Alston Fine Arts, New York;
  private collection, New York.<br><br>This large print is an interpretration of the
  central image of Faith Ringgold''s 1985 Part I</i> story quilt. Unlike the typically
  painted images of her story quilts, both parts of her <i>No More War Story Quilts</i>
  include intaglio-printed images in the central panel, creating an abstraction of
  fallen bodies in conflict.<br><br>In 1984, Ringgold first made a series of intaglio
  prints entitled <i>The Death of Apartheid</i> and <i>Women, Power, Poverty and Love</i>.
  She then continued printmaking as a Visiting Artist at Bob Blackburn’s Printmaking
  Workshop in New York where she developed a technique for etching on canvas that
  would be used to make the <i>No More War Story Quilts</i> the following year. Farrington
