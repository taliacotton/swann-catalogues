Signed and dated in acrylic, lower left.<br><br>Provenance: the estate of the artist.<br><br>Music and color serve as the compositional key in Paul Keene's <i>Jazz Icon Series.</i> A master of the manipulation of scale, color, light, and a lifelong jazz music enthusiast brings Keene's anonymous portraits of jazz musicians to life. His use of a vibrant color palette to express his passion for jazz, characterized by improvisation and an energetic rhythm, reflects his passion for the medium. Music was a large part of Paul Keene’s life, and his strong interest in blues and jazz began as a young boy. As a child, he was inspired by gospel music. As a teenager, he waited with his friends to see jazz musicians playing in the clubs in Philadelphia. Keene felt jazz was a rhythmic and unique language. He believed that to succeed as a fine artist, “…the work must sing out, and the viewer must hear it.” He admired the musician Miles Davis and said he could \"create a picture in your mind with his music.” Biography courtesy of the Michener Art Museum."
