  <i>Barthé: A Life in Sculpture</i>, fig. 529; p. 177 (another cast).<br><br>This
  beautiful, tall sculpture is truly a majestic figure, and a scarce example of a
  large female bronze by Ricmond Barthé. Margaret Vendryes remarks how this striding
  figure "harkens back to <i>Blackberry Woman</i> to a time of Barthé''s newly discovered
  talent with clay" but with a regal air of remove. <i>Black Majesty<i> was made in
  Barthé''s last year living in Jamaica, before his move to Florence, Italy where
  he lived until 1975. Vendryes p. 177.'
