TYPESET: 'Oil on linen canvas, 1989. 914x1016 mm; 36x40 inches. Signed in oil, lower
  right.<br><br>Provenance: the estate of the artist; thence by descent to the current
  owner, California.<br><br>Exhibited: June Kelly Gallery, New York; Anderson Gallery,
  Buffalo, NY, with the labels on the frame back.<br><br><i>Curtain Call</i> is a
  wonderful example from the artist''s late series of paintings depicting musicians
  or actors in a staged environment. The year before, in 1988, Hughie Lee-Smith had
  his first retrospective at the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton. Other Lee-Smith
  paintings from this series include <i>End of Act One</i>, 1984, and <i>Temptation</i>,
  1991.<br><br>These imagined scenes recall Lee-Smith''s early experiences of dance
  and theater while working at the Playhouse Settlement (named Karamu House in 1941)
  during the WPA period in Cleveland.  Lee-Smith taught art at Karamu House in the
  late 1930s in return for the full scholarship to the Cleveland School of Art (now
  the Art Institute of Cleveland) that the Gilpin Players awarded him in 1935. Inspired
  by the Gilpin Players, a black acting troupe, Lee-Smith also founded an inter-racial
  modern dance troupe there.'
