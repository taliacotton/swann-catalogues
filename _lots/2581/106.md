Lewis: Works on Paper, 1935 - 1979</i>, Billl Hodges Gallery, New York, p. 24.<br><br>This beautiful abstraction is an excellent and painterly example of Norman Lewis's late career work on paper. This large sheet of Arches is one of the largest formats that the artist used for works on paper in the 1970s. Norman Lewis added more high key and saturated colors in his painting after a visit with his wife Ouida to Jack Whitten's residence in Crete in the summer of 1973. The development of the <i>Seachange<D> series with more abstract compositions of vibrating, concentric circles followed in 1975. That year he was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation fellowship, and the following year in the fall of 1976, Lewis had his first retrospective, with 63 artworks included in <i>Norman Lewis: A Retrospective<D>, at The Graduate School and University Center of City College, New York. Fine pp. 181, 245-46 and 267."
