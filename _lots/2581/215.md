TYPESET: "Chromogenic print, 2006-09. 753x596 mm; 29⅝x23½ inches. Numbered 2/5 on the gallery label on the frame back.<br><br>Provenance: D' Amelio Terras Gallery, New York; private collection, New York.<br><br>In <i>Riffs on Real Time,</i> a series of ten color photographs, Leslie Hewitt sets up a dynamic between personal archival images and stock images from newspapers and magazines. Influenced by her grandmother's method of arrangement of their family photos in albums, Hewitt’s production of the series follows a set compositional order. The foreground of the image of a living room, a candid shot of a family barbecue in the backyard—suggests a personal iconography. The second layer evokes circulated material culture: a snapshot of a 1960s civil rights march harkens back to Hewitt’s childhood and her parent's involvement in the movement and can be found in either layer. The third layer is a background of flooring that reveals various dings, scrapes, or gouges resulting from everyday use. Within this third, seemingly domesticated layer, Hewitt allows the sense of myriad public and private selves to collide and converse.<br><br>Born in 1977 in Saint Albans, New York, Leslie Hewitt earned a BFA from the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, in 2000, and an MFA in sculpture from Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, in 2004. From 2001 to 2003, she was a Clark Fellow in Africana studies and cultural studies at New York University. Hewitt has had solo exhibitions at The Kitchen, New York (2010), Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2011); and Contemporary Art Museum of Saint Louis (2012). Her work has been a part of many group exhibitions, including the Whitney Biennial, New York (2008), <i>New Photography 2009,</i> Museum of Modern Art, New York (2009); <i>Human Nature: Contemporary Art from the Collection,</i> Los Angeles County Museum of Art (2011); <i.Under Another Name,</i> Studio Museum in Harlem, New York (2014); and <i>Photo-Poetics: An Anthology</i>, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (2015). Hewitt lives and works in New York."
