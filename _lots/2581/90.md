CROSSHEAD: Ritual Bayou.
year: 1971
TYPESET: 'Set of 6 editioned collages, color photo-lithograph mounted on finished
  plywood, as issued, 1971. Each approx. 394x508 mm; 15Â½x20 inches. Each signed and
  numbered 21/75 in ink. Published by Sherwood Publishers, New York.<br><br>The individual
  titles are: <i>Memories</i> * <i>Reunion</i> * <i>Ritual Bayou</i> * <i>Carolina
  Interior</i> * <i>Mississippi Monday</i> * <i>Byzantine Frieze</i>.<br><br>This
  is a very scarce complete set from Romare Bearden''s brief experimentation with
  editioned collages in the early 1970s. Each was made from photo-lithographs printed
  from collages Bearden had shown in the 1971 Musem of Modern Art, New York, exhibition,
  <i>Romare Bearden: The Prevalence of Ritual</i> and the 1975 Everson Museum of Art,
  Syracuse, exhibition, <i>Mysteries: Women in the Art of Romare Bearden</i>.<br><br>However,
  it is not known, and very unlikely, that Bearden completed the intended edition
  of 75--it was an overwhelming project to match and collage the prints. Mary Lee
  Corlett in <i>From Process to Print Graphic Works by Romare Bearden</i> describes
  the overly ambitious production commissioned by Sam Shore, owner of Shorewood Atelier,
  New York. Shore was a major Bearden collector and donated <i>The Block</i> to the
  Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1978. Bearden and his publisher had originally selected
  18 collages, and planned three different sets of six for the project. But the artist
  only made multiples from the first six collages. Swann Galleries sold the only other
  known complete set at auction on February 27, 2011. Corlett p. 13.'
