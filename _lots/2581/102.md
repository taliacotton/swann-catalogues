  estate of the artist; private collection, New York.<br><br>This expressive bust
  appears to be a preliminary work by Inge Hardison for her 1976 <i>Sojourner Truth</i>,
  and is, with lot 103 in this auction, the first unique work of artist Inge Hardison
  to come to auction. Despite a lengthy career as a sculptor and living to the age
  of 102, Inge Hardison''s work is not widely known today beyond her popular series
  of small cast busts of historical figures <i>Negro Giants in History</i> in 1963
  and <i>Ingenious Americans</i> in the late 1960s.<br><br>Born in Portsmouth, VA,
  Hardison''s family moved to Brooklyn in the 1930s where she pursued many creative
  interests including acting and dance. Alice Bernstein in her article "Inge Hardison
  at 100" in the <i>International Review of African American Art</i> wrote how after
  graduating from high school Hardison landed a role in the 1936 Broadway production
  of <i>Sweet River</i>, George Abbott’s adaptation of Uncle Tom’s Cabin which won
  her rave reviews, and also appeared in <i>The Country Wife</i> with Ruth Gordon,
  and in the 1946 production of <i>Anna Lucasta,</i> co-starring with Ossie Davis
  and Ruby Dee. She later attended Vassar College, majoring in music and creative
  writing, and later took art classes at the Arts Students League in New York. She
  also taught with Victor Lowenfeld at Hampton University from 1955-46.<br><br>Hardison
  also made a wide range of figurative sculpture including several large public works,
  including the life-size 1957 bronze <i>Mother and Child</i> at Mt. Sinai Hospital
  in Manhattan and the 7-foot abstract figure <i>Jubilee</i> at Medgar Evers College
  in Brooklyn. Hardison was only woman founding member of the Black Academy of Arts
  and Letters (BAAL), an African-American cultural organization created in 1969 for
  the preservation and promotion of black culture. Hardison''s standing wood figure
  <i>Sojourner Truth</i> was presented to Nelson Mandela by New York Governor Mario
  Cuomo in 1990. Her artwork is found today in the collections of the Princeton University
  Art Museum, the Detroit Historical Museum, the National Woman''s Party, Washington,
  DC, the New York State Harlem Art Collection, New York, and the Schomburg Center
  for Research in Black Culture, New York. iraaa.museum.hampton.edu; St. James pp.
