FOOTNOTE: '2 January 1924: ". . . I wish the nation had you back at the head of the
  Shipping Board. We would then, at least, have a policy and effective management.
  . . ."<br>The United States Shipping Board, chaired by Edward N. Hurley during the
  first World War, was charged with increasing and managing the fleet of commercial
  ships in support of the War. After the War, President Calvin Coolidge came into
  conflict with the Board--which had continued to attempt to increase the amount of
  commerce carried by U.S. ships--because he wanted to support U.S. businesses, which
  had, in recent years, increasingly found foreign shippers to be more convenient.
  In 1934, the Board was abolished and its functions transferred to various agencies
  in the Department of Commerce.<br>With--Archive of over 40 Typed Letters Signed
  by various Senators, FDR''s secretaries, and others, to Edward N. Hurley, mostly
