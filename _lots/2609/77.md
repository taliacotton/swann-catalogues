at-a-glance: "London, 15 June 1887; 17 January 1888"
FOOTNOTE: "15 June 1887: \". . . I am glad to think that those days before your letter was written I had in a speech carefully detached from the subject of Home Rule the exclusion of Irish members & left that question fully open . . . .<br>\"I have at all times urged & shall urge legality in Ireland. But you will be surprised to learn that in our belief the crime of Ireland is less than that of England or Scotland . . . .\"<br>17 January 1888: \"No questions are more embarrassing than those which relate to Irish History in its present undigested state.<br>\"If you desire a bird's eye view of the early period, I should recommend your consulting D. O'Connell's memoir on Irish History published in or about 1844, since although it is an ex parte work it relies principally on citations which purport to be authoritative. . . .\""
