DESCRIPT: HESSE, HERMANN.
CROSSHEAD: 'Two notes, each Signed, "HHesse," to aphorist Hans Margolius, in German:
  Autograph Note * Typed Note.'
TYPESET: 'The first, on a photograph postcard, thanking for his manuscript, remarking
  that, while he is no longer much of a reader, in leafing through, he finds a beautiful
  belief in humanity and in humanity''s determination, and noting that the work gave
  him a good feeling. The photograph on verso, bust portrait by Widmann showing him.
  With holograph inscription at lower edge: "(1926)." The second, on a small card,
  thanking for his letter, noting that, while they agree on most matters, his own
  notion of the "real master" does not include those who consider themselves great,
  since they ignore the essential characteristic of a great artist: self-criticism.  With
  a reproduction of a woodcut by him on first page. Together 3 pages, 12mo, the second
  written on recto and verso; horizontal fold to second.'
at-a-glance: ZÃ¼rich, 19 October 1951 [from postmark]; Np, nd
FOOTNOTE: 'Np, nd: ". . . [A]s far as my assessment of a ''real master'' is concerned,
  I stick to what is natural and seems right to me. I''m not very fond of all those
  artists who consider themselves solemnly great, and act that way; examples would
  be Victor Hugo, [Christian Friedrich] Hebbel, [Stefan] George. But the many not-great
  ones who go along with the pose of the Olympian, and I have known many, show me
  clearly how little good it is when an artist--simply because he writes poetry, paints
  or makes music--counts himself among the chosen ones and forgets about self-criticism,
  a habit no artist should ever be without.'
