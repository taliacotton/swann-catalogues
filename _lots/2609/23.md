FOOTNOTE: "\". . . I have just finished a long letter to Sam'l Fessenden . . . .<br>\"I write in answer to a letter rec'd from him, in which I tho't he manifested more low spirits than become him. I hope you do your best to put him up. You have done him much Service heretofore, & I doubt not the fountain of your heart is still unexhausted. . . .<br>\"I wish to inform your Bro' Robert that the Commerc'l Bank is not yet in operation. . . . [T]he Legislature when they made the charter, were so vigorous as to begat twins, for truly there are now, two sets of men, who call themselves the Commerc'l Bank Corporation. Each Set has its directors . . . . It is said the other Set will go into operation in a few months, & have it to the Superior Court to decide which is the real Bank. A novel spectacle, this. . . . I am, on the whole, inclined to the opinion that the Towne Bank will prevail. . . .\""
