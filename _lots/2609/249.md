  belief, explaining that he cannot clarify a point in a work of his own because he
  does not travel with his papers and directing him to a German version published
  in the Virginia Quarterly Review, granting him permission to publish a sentence,
  noting that he himself has not written any aphorisms, advising him against extracting
  short passages from his own works, questioning whether 'security' and 'happiness'
  are what they seem, and anticipating the anthology of his aphorisms. Together 6

FOOTNOTE: '9 May 1952, ALS: ". . . I have read your sayings on ethics with sympathy
  and am with you completely when you celebrate kindness as the best thing on earth.
  [Gotthold Ephraim] Lessing said of his ''Nathan'' [Nathan the Wise]: ''It will be
  nothing less than a satirical piece to leave the battlefield with jeers; it''s going
  to be as touching a piece as I''ve ever done.''--Instead of ''satirical'' he could
  have said ''nihilistic'' if the word had already existed, and instead of ''touching'':
  ''good''. He wasn''t very religious. But doubt is perhaps even a better breeding
  ground for goodness than belief."<br>19 June 1953, ALS: ". . . I have read your
  maxims on ethics with serious pleasure. I have great faith in devotion, admiration,
  loyalty, but I put a question mark after ''security and happiness.'' The two havens
  of ideal security today are communism and the Catholic Church. I understand very
  well that in a yen[?] one looks for the ''fixed place'' and the happiness that this
  gives them. Personally, I prefer to look the Sphinx in the eye without fear."<br>13
  November 1853, TLS: ". . . [T]here really is something fundamentally friendly about
  the aphorisms you sent me. They are very simple in part, and yet they often speak
  haunting truths, such as that praise advances us rather than blame, and that a man
  and his work need a measure of appreciation and goodwill if he is to continue to
  move forward actively. . . ."'
