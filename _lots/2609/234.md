FOOTNOTE: "\". . . I have read the article on the Father of New England, and recognize your qualification to speak with authority on my attempts to depict their characters and times.<br>\"My mind, at this time, is not in a productive state; for I have worked it very hard and continuously during two or three months past, and I promised myself to be idle during the rest of my stay in England. I enjoy my residence here so much . . . that I wish to defer all literary toil and other business of life till my return home.<br>\"Your acquaintance with New England history will have suggested to you, I think, that it affords very little variety of subject for the romance-writer. Taking into view its limitations of accident, character, and colouring, and likewise the limitations of my own faculty, I doubt whether I could find the theme for another Puritan Story.\""
