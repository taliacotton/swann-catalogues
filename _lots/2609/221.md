CROSSHEAD: "Typed Letter Signed, to Arnold Weissberger,"
TYPESET: "granting permission for LIFE magazine to use his signature, requesting that he inquire of Andre Senutovitch's agent why Senutovitch has not yet confirmed the theatrical piece he commissioned, proposing an updated reprinting of his own autobiography, and requesting that he acknowledge to Lincoln [Kirstein] the details about the ballet proposed for November [Agon, at the City Center in New York], and giving travel plans. 1 page, 4to, onionskin paper; four punch holes in left margin, folds, ink received stamp at upper right."
at-a-glance: "Venice, 17 September 1957"
FOOTNOTE: "\". . . I think it is a good moment for a reprinting of the autobiography . . . . May I suggest also that . . . the questions and answers printed in the Atlantic Monthly, plus a new set . . . could be added to the autobiography . . . . Also, R. Craft could be commissioned to add a complete catalogue of my works together with a chronological table of biographical events from the conclusion of the autobiography to the present. Schott has just done this with a new German edition (but with a very incorrect catalogue which is why I am anxious to have a correct one). . . .\""
