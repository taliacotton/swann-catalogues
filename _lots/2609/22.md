DESCRIPT: WADE, BENJAMIN F.
CROSSHEAD: Autograph Letter Signed, "B.F. Wade," to "Dr Sch.,"

  and that it will "send him to hell" [spoil his chances for a Democratic nomination
  in 1844 presidential election?], praising his letter concerning an article in the
  Cleveland Harold, hoping to learn more about [Whig presidential candidate Henry]

FOOTNOTE: '". . . Whigery seems to be on the rise . . . . We think that Van will at
  last go for Texas. I hope he will, as it will send him to hell a little sooner than
  he would go the natural way. I have just read your reply to the Cleveland Herald.
  . . . I am glad you have used him up on it. I am anxious to know exactly how Clay
  & his friends stand upon the Texas question for if he wavers here he is lost. [I]n
  such an event I would oppose him if he were an Angel and so would most of his party
  here. . . ."'
