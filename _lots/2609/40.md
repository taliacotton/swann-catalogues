FOOTNOTE: "27 November 1907: \". . . I hope you will continue your researches concerning the results of 'Consanguineous Marriages' as the whole subject is of immense importance.<br>\"My studies have related chiefly to 'Consanguineous Marriages' in their relation to Deafness, and my data are on file in the Volta Bureau, For the Increase and Diffusion of Knowledge Relating to the Deaf . . . .\"<br>14 February 1908: \". . . In regard to the term 'parents cousins' used in the Census Report of the Blind and the Deaf, I think we may translate it to mean 'parents who are related by blood' and not simply first cousins.<br>\"The late Mr. King who had immediate charge of the tabulation informed me that other relationships than first cousins had been included. . . .<br>\"I . . . enclose an advance proof of an address I made recently to the American Breeders' Association entitled, 'A Few Thoughts Concerning Eugenics' containing statistics from the Census Returns indicating an intensification of an inherited tendency towards Blindness or Deafness produced by inbreeding.\"<br>In 1908, Arner's book Consanguineous Marriages in the American Population was published by Longmans, Green & Co."
