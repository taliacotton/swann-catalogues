DESCRIPT: "TROTSKY, LEON."
CROSSHEAD: "The Revolution Betrayed. What is the Soviet Union and Where is it Going?"
TYPESET: "Translated by Max Eastman. 8vo, original black cloth, dampstaining to front and back covers, spine tips and corners fraying slightly, abrading to rear cover; blank sticker obscuring ownership signature on front flyleaf, dampstain to top-edges with thin bleed to blank upper margins of contents. First edition, inscribed and signed by Trotsky on blank preliminary, \"Leon Trotsky / 3 Apr 1937 / Coyoacan.\"  A very few inscribed copies signed in the same year and place have appeared on the market over the years, though it is certain that at least two of these have traded hands several times so that the number of these inscribed copies are less than it initially might appear. It is surmised that the Dewey Commission was the occasion from which these copies derive. Three years later Trotsky was murdered while still in exile in Mexico by Stalin's agents."
