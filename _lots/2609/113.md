FOOTNOTE: "\"We beat the enemy well yesterday at Rastatt, my dear General. Prince Charles was there, it is said; it is certain that he marched there with reinforcements. Jourdan writes to me that it is in our favor, but there is not a moment to lose. You must, my dear general, make an effort to drive the enemy out of Breisgau . . . . Leave with little and only the bare necessities . . . and surely you will be able to do it. I know that . . . these troops . . . evacuate[d] Freiburg and withdr[e]w their batteries above the Rhine . . . . [A]bove all act. Freudenstadt's position will make them wary . . . . Give me your news often. Today we reconcile our losses of yesterday; they are quite substantial, especially in artillery. . . .\"<br>The postscript: \"I just heard that Prince Charles is taking his reserve of Saxons and other troops. I gave the order to send to Saint-Cyr . . . the 17th light infantry. You can dispose of those . . . who are in Kehl. . . . This will give you about 16,000 men and surely you will be more capable than we . . . . Above all try to beat the enemy . . . .\""
