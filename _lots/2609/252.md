pullquote: Pound seeks investors in scheme to help T.S. Eliot leave his bank job
DESCRIPT: POUND, EZRA.
CROSSHEAD: Typed Letter Signed, to Cleveland English teacher Clarence Stratton ("Dear
  Mr. Stratton"),
TYPESET: acknowledging having seen the New York Times article [Alice Rohe's "Bel Esprit
  for Attic Dwellers" in the June 17, 1923 issue], sending a circular [not present],
  speculating how much annually Eliot would require in order to take care of himself
  and his ailing wife, characterizing Eliot's work at the bank as an impediment to
  his important work of writing, explaining that his goal is to help Eliot rather
  than to compete with him, and suggesting that investing in Bel Esprit is analogous
  to the initial outlay required to install electric light in a village. 2 pages,
  4to, written on two sheets; few short closed separations at folds, slight even toning
  overall, several holograph corrections throughout.
at-a-glance: Paris, 1 August 1923
FOOTNOTE: '"I have at last seen a copy of N.Y. Times article on Bel Esprit. Miss Rohe
  has been O.K. as to aim of society, and very clear on everything save the main point,
  i.e., that T.S. Eliot has NOT got any benefit from it. . . .<br>"We can''t rake
  up Eliot''s private affairs every time the subject is discussed, but with his wife
  a chronic invalid he simply can''t give up a sure 3000 dollars a year for an utterly
  uncertain 1500.<br>"Given a sure 1500 or 2000 he MIGHT make 1000 or 1500 by his
  writing, that is, by his really important work . . . .<br>". . . [I]f I wanted to
  prevent Eliot''s writing better than I do, I shd, of course try to provide all possible
  impediments, a la Standard Oil.<br>"Unfortunately or fortunately literature differs
  from commerce. . . ."<br>In early 1922, even before the world could be astonished
  by T.S. Eliot''s The Waste Land published later that year, Ezra Pound hatched a
  plan to prevent his friend Eliot from wasting his talents working as a clerk at
  Lloyds Bank in London. The idea, dubbed "Bel Esprit," was to collect sufficient
  subscriptions from wealthy benefactors to allow Eliot to make his living by the
  quill, and the moment was ripe, because Eliot had left the bank to recover from
  a debilitating nervous condition. Pound explained to prospective subscribers that
  the money would be an investment in poetry. Only a few joined Bel Esprit, and before
  the project could gather steam, Eliot returned to the bank, seduced by steady income
  and a pension.<br>In the Spring 1971 issue of The Massachusetts Review, the letter
  in this lot is discussed in Donald E. Herdeck''s article, "A New Letter by Ezra
  Pound about T.S. Eliot."<br>Also see Lot 356.'
