FOOTNOTE: "\"I appreciated the meaningful points raised in your letter to me concerning racial appellations. The words 'dark skinned American' constitute a vivid depiction of both citizenship and race just as you point out. I agree wholeheartedly with you that the import of that term is in salient contrast with the connotation attached to the word 'nigger.' The word 'nigger' carries with it a meaning deeply rooted in the debilitating racist caste ordering of our society's slavery epoch and segregation era.<br>\"The term, 'dark skinned American,' often finds its way into my speeches and writings and, encouragingly, I notice it, too, in the usage of so many others. The use of that and similar appellations reflect both our great heritage and our devotion to a brand of Americanism of the highest order.\""
