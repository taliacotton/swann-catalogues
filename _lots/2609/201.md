  Edward N. Hurley.'
TYPESET: 'The first, sending a telegram [present], arguing that Japanese monopoly
  over shipping routes in the Pacific has driven rates unacceptably high, suggesting
  that Europe might divert a portion of their shipping to alleviate the problem, and
  recommending that he bring the matter to Hurley''s attention. The second, sending
  Lansing''s letter and asking, in full: "Is there anything possible to be done about
  this? It is clearly a serious situation, and I should like to see it relieved."
  Together 3 pages, 4to, the first written on a folded sheet, the second on "The President
  of the United States" embossed stationery with integral blank; horizontal fold,

at-a-glance: Paris, 6; 9 January 1919
FOOTNOTE: 'Lansing: ". . . After our entrance into the war, as you know, American
  shipping was almost wholly withdrawn from the Pacific which left to the Japanese
  nearly a complete monopoly of the carrying trade between the United States and the
  Far East. The rates became exorbitant and American merchants complained of discrimination
  against themselves. . . .<br>"The demand for tonnage in the Atlantic of course,
  is pressing. The starving people of Europe must be fed and the material needed for
  reconstruction work in Belgium and France must be supplied, but if the suffering
  nations of Europe can divert a part of their shipping to this effort to recapture
  control of Far Eastern commerce it may . . . protect in a measure our own commercial
  interests in the Orient. . . ."<br>With--Telegram from Counselor of the United States
  Department of State Frank Polk to Robert Lansing, describing the problem summarized
  in Lansing''s letter. 1 page, 4to, telegram form. Washington, 3 January 1919.'
