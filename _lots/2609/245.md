FOOTNOTE: "\"So far I have paid no attention to your yells of discomfort from Contrexeville because I know that the treatment there was good for you. Now I say God help you! I have never drunk waters but once, out of pure boredom. I was washed at Vernet-les-Bains. So I too have lived. Somehow the vision of you sitting on a bench from 9 to 5 makes me think of an angry hawk pegged out on a lawn. Why you didn't go out of your alleged mind puzzles me? I'll see if you have, later on. No matter. You needed the swilling and sloshing . . . .<br>\"Tell us when you are fit to go among friends again (I can't help thinking of you with close-cropped hair & a pallid complexion) and we'll get you down here ere the recurring dinner swallows you. That cartoonist of yours is damn good.\""
