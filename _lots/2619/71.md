The revenue generated was intended for, among other things, \"the support of government, for the discharge of the debts of the United States, and the encouragement and protection of manufactures,\" the most significant debt being that incurred from the Revolutionary War. A collector and Naval officer were appointed and stationed at what was deemed the nation's sole port of entry, Philadelphia.
