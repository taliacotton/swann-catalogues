FOOTNOTE: "\". . . I gave the book the most attentive reception when it came to me in so kindly a way . . . . It will give me the most lively pleasure to trace . . . my way over the familiar passages to its meaning.<br>\"You are referring in your letter to the evening at the Fischer's which I . . . remember as my first contact with your poetry and yourself; our small circle had the tension and attention of a very beautiful mutuality. However, you exaggerate if you tend to credit me primarily with the existence of your verses in the book market. Your excellent friend had introduced to us your poems so well, he proved to us . . . their real poetry; on re-reading them I felt . . . more deeply . . . joy about their . . . existence. . . .\"<br>In 1914, Alfred Wolfenstein's first book of poems, Die gottlosen Jahre was published by Samuel Fischer after the urging and support of Rilke and Robert Musil."
