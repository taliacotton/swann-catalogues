DESCRIPT: DOUGLASS, FREDERICK.
CROSSHEAD: Autograph Letter Signed, to an unnamed recipient ("Dear Sir"),
TYPESET: stating that absence explains his delay in replying, remarking that [James]
  Redpath's biography of John Brown is adequate for providing the main facts [The
  Public Life of Capt. John Brown (1860)], and suggesting that he write a Boston bookseller
  to obtain it. 1 page, 8vo, ruled paper; horizontal folds, uncommonly good condition.
at-a-glance: Washington, 9 November 1882
pullquote: '"THERE IS NO ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY BIOGRAPHY OF JOHN BROWN"'
FOOTNOTE: '". . . There is no entirely satisfactory Biography of John Brown. There
  is one written by Mr. Redpath of Boston which in a rough and hasty way give the
  main facts of Brown''s life; but I fear you may not be able to find even that at
  this late day. You might write to some Boston Bookseller and possibly pick one up."<br>Although
  the friendship between Douglass and John Brown was not always close, the two were
  together at one of the most formative moments in both their lives. In 1858, Brown
  shared Douglass''s home in Rochester, NY, as he worked out the details for his raid
  on Harper''s Ferry. Although Brown encouraged Douglass to join him at Harper''s
  Ferry, Douglass declined. After the raid, and the Civil War that followed it, Douglass
  delivered a speech at Harper''s Ferry that acknowledged the importance of Brown
  to history and to the cause of justice, a cause to which Brown and Douglass shared
  the same level of devotion: "If John Brown did not end the war that ended slavery,
  he did, at least, begin the war that ended slavery."'
