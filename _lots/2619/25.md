However I couldn't bring myself to opening a thank you note with, '.....and no matter how big I get, Mr. Sobol, you gave me my first break....,' and blah, blah, blah. . . .\"<br>11 June 1959, TLS, \"Love Lenny,\" to \"Dear Vic[tor Lownes, Playboy Promotions Manager?]\": Here is a piece I have written about show biz.

But dig, after you have the brochure who do you sell it to, how--what I need is someone to sell the shares of what ever some one who believes that there is an untapped market shot: The picture about a junkie prostitute that has made $$$ would have made mucho . . . if a junkie prostitute made the film. You have to dig it to dig it. You dig?\" With a postscript: \"No yes for a review . . . . Dock Sobel is got me [arrow pointing to small drawing of man being chased by an axe]. But the movie I wish you would help me.\"<br>Nd, ALS, \"Love Lenny,\" to Singer: \"I have to wait till I fly home Feb 10th or 12 to send you the short. I'm the only one who knows where it is. So the 12 [small drawing of man climbing a ladder waving a flag].\"<br>With--Three items, unsigned: Partly-printed letter from Bruce to Margot Chapman returning payment for Confessions of a Dirty Talking Dope Fiend because \"Production of this record has come to a halt due to my present difficulties with the obscenity law.\" ¾ page, 4to.
