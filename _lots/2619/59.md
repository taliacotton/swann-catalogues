  on August 6, 1945 and serving as weather plane for Bockscar''s flight to Nagasaki
  three days later, the B-29 bomber Enola Gay flew on April 29, 1946 to Kwajalein
  Island in order to take part in Operation Crossroads during which a Mark III nuclear
  bomb was dropped on Bikini Atoll to test its power on marine vessels. Although the
  Enola Gay was initially expected to make the drop after a competition was held to
  find the ideal crew, command announced that the drop would be made by Woodrow Swancutt''s
  crew in another B-29, Dave''s Dream. Feeling snubbed, commander Paul W. Tibbets,
  navigator Theodore J. Van Kirk, and the rest of the Enola Gay crew remained at Kwajalein
  as consultants. On the day of the drop, Tibbets and Van Kirk reviewed weather reports
  and noted that the calculations produced by the crew of Dave''s Dream would result
  in the bomb missing its target by over 1,000 feet, which information they offered
  to the Dave''s Dream crew. Tibbets''s advice was ignored, and when the bomb was
  dropped on June 30 at 21:00 UTC, it missed the target, just as Tibbets and Van Kirk
  anticipated. One of the logs in the present lot dated July 1 records Enola Gay''s
  flight from Kwajalein to Honolulu the following morning. On July 24, the Enola Gay
  was flown to Davis-Monthan Army Airfield in AZ, where it was put into storage.<br>Provenance:
  Theodore J. Van Kirk, thence by gift to present owner.'
