FOOTNOTE: "\"Alas! dear sir, I gladly give you the support of my name, but my effective collaboration is impossible. I'm way too busy. Draw whatever you please from my published works, and even then you must first make a treaty with the Société des Gens de Lettres. I left the press, I locked myself in my novels, and in the evening I'm too tired to get back to other work.\"<br>Despite his claim about leaving journalism, Zola could not keep away from the newspapers since, less than a year later, he expressed his outrage at the Dreyfuss affair in an open letter to France's president--\"J'Accuse...!\"--published in the Paris daily L'Aurore to sensational effect."
