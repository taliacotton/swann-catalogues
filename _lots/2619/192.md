George Lippard (1822-1854) was a close friend of Poe and founder of the Brotherhood of the Union, an early labor union. His popular fiction, which \"represented the wildly subversive underside of the antebellum literary scene\" (ANB) is often divided between the \"city mysteries\" (The Quaker City), and mythologized retellings of American history (Washington and his Generals). He died of tuberculosis at 31. Signed copies of any of his books are very scarce. (3)"
