DESCRIPT: FIRBANK, RONALD.
CROSSHEAD: Letters to Grant Richards.
TYPESET: 'Small 4to, custom bound in contemporary blue buckram, gilt-lettered front
  cover, top edges gilt, sunning to spine and board edges, two small paint marks to
  rear cover; offsetting to front and end matter. An ostensibly unique bound volume
  containing typed copies of 33 letters from Firbank to his publisher Grant Richards,
  sequentially dated from 26 December 1914 to 18 August 1917, around the period that
  his first two novels, Vainglory and Inclinations, were published. Also with 5 of
  the original Autograph Letters Signed, of those included in the book, one mounted
  and the 4 others laid in within two envelopes (each bearing the typed legend "Spring
  List: Item 105"). The reason for this typewritten volume''s production is not entirely
  clear; it''s appearance would seem to pre-date Richard''s death in 1948 and it is
  not unlikely that it was produced for Richards himself. [Np, nd]. [With:] Odette;
  A Fairy Tale for Weary People. 4 illustrations by Albert Buhrer. Thin 8vo, pictorial
  wrappers, extremities darkened, few small edge chips. First edition. London: Grant
  Richards, 1916. Benkovitz A4. (2)'
