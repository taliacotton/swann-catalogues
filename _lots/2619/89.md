FOOTNOTE: "\". . . The Bonds which you have taken from Mr Whiting had better remain in your hands until they are discharged and by the time you propose to be at Belvoir in April I will endeavor to prepare a proper rental for you if it shall be in my power from the pressure of other matters.<br>\". . . [T]he Tenants should pay the taxes of their own Lotts but if the Leases neither expresses nor implies it I do not suppose there is anything else to compel them--consequently Mr Whiting must be allowed such sums as he has actually paid--look however at his Lease & judge yourself of the fact as I speak more from what ought to be perhaps than what really is, and do not want to enter into an improper litigation of the matter.\"<br>Published in The Writings of George Washington, Vol 28, ed. John C. Fitzpatrick (Washington, 1938), 62."
