FOOTNOTE: "The note, in full: \"This was the first 'edited' draft of the submitted manuscript. I think 8 xeroxed copies were made, for submission to book clubs, some magazines, and readings by other people at Knopf. In the meanwhile, my editor and I were doing the real editing from this manuscript, and this accounts for the considerable differences between this and the published manuscript. Thus, there was a typed or xeroxed submitted copy that constituted the true first draft. It was about 950 pages & I doubt that any copies are around.\""
