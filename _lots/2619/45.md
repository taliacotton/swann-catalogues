pullquote: '"EINSTEIN WANTED TO MAKE THE DANGERS OF ATOMIC WEAPONS CLEAR TO THE WORLD"'
FOOTNOTE: '25 December 1959, ALS: ". . . I took up this work [campaigning against
  nuclear weapons] as a friend of Einstein. We knew each other since his time in Berlin.
  It was a very intense friendship. In his last years, Einstein wanted to make the
  dangers of atomic weapons clear to the world, but no one listened to him. He suffered
  terribly as a result. He died in a state of despair. . . ."<br>7 February 1965,
  ALS: ". . . Only by being attentive to and involved in creation do we truly become
  human. . . . I could not bear the fact that European philosophy does not deal with
  the problem of our relationship to creation. . . .<br>". . . . Friendship is something
  deep and beautiful. In the quiet of Lambaréné, animal friendships flourish. Three
  hippopotamuses spend some nights on the bank by our hospital because they know that
  no one will harm them there. . . ."'
