In the Spring of 1785, after serving in the Continental Army and as aide-de-camp to both Washington and Lafayette, George Augustine married Frances \"Fanny\" Bassett at Mount Vernon, where the couple lived as part of George and Martha Washington's household. Occasionally, George Augustine visited his in-laws in New Kent County, VA, \"below,\" or to the south of, Mount Vernon.
