FOOTNOTE: "On January 24, 1965, just weeks before being murdered, Malcolm X delivered a speech in Harlem in which he encouraged a critical review of the narrative surrounding America's \"founding fathers,\" picking out Thomas Jefferson as being especially worthy of condemnation by pointing out that his believing in the words he authored--\"all men are created equal\"--while owning slaves, implied that he did not intend those words to apply to the enslaved. Because of this hypocrisy, Malcolm X said, African-Americans should look upon Jefferson with the same contempt he showed them. Malcolm X on Afro-American History (1965)."
