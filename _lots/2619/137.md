FOOTNOTE: "\". . . Should the painting TWILIGHT be again on the market I shall be very glad to let you know.<br>\"As to what constitutes a 'fair' price for such a painting, Heaven only knows. Its wicked to ask as much as I do, but people seem to overlook the crime, and in most states there seems to be no law compelling them to buy.<br>\". . . [I]n a little exhibition I had in New [Yo]rk over a year ago the prices ranged all the way from 1000 [fo]r small paintings up to the price of this one. Paintings of this size, 24 x 30 are priced all the way from 2000. to 4000. according to their quality, rather an arbitrary method, but quality is a hit or miss affair, generally a miss, and it is the chief feature in determining the value of a picture.\""
