FOOTNOTE: "\"Golly. I'm working like a nigger baby and shall be for six weeks--after the last performance here I must . . . start work at once on rehearsals . . . . But the picture of a weekend with you and the Hartmans and the babies (I'm a big baby-judge and adore 'em as only a bachelor can) is more . . . attractive. But I'm in a profession now that has no let-up. Work, work, work. Absorbing but exacting. I've been seeing Rebekah Higginson from time to time and memories of Tucson are as pleasurable as ever. If you are coming to see our racket, do stop around afterwards, but rain or shine. . . .\"<br>In mid-July, 1939, the South Shore Players performed Wilder's Our Town in Cohasset, MA."
