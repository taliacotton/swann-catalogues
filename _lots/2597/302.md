  332, number 1928-1.<br><br>Lurçat (1892-1966) was a French artist best known for
  his revival of tapestry art.  He was an important and successful painter for over
  twenty years and frequented the same artistic circles as Pablo Picasso and Louis
  Marcoussis before delving into textile arts in the late 193os.  He traveled extensively
  through Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, deriving much inspiration from
  cultural exposure.  Though Lurçat is celebrated for reviving tapestries as an art
  form, he experimented with many other art forms as well, such as book illustration,
  engraving and ceramics.'
