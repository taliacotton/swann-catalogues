He was an important and successful painter for over twenty years and frequented the same artistic circles as Pablo Picasso and Louis Marcoussis before delving into textile arts in the late 193os.  He traveled extensively through Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, deriving much inspiration from cultural exposure.  Though Lurçat is celebrated for reviving tapestries as an art form, he experimented with many other art forms as well, such as book illustration, engraving and ceramics."
