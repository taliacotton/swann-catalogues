TYPESET: "Lithograph printed in brown on <i>Chine appliqué</i>, on greenish gray wove paper, circa 1888-89. 235x370 mm; 9¼x10⅝ inches, wide margins. The deluxe edition of 25 before text, aside from the regular edition of 100 with text in the lower margin. Signed by both Degas and Thornley in pencil, lower margin. Printed by Atelier Becquet, Paris. Published by Boussod-Valadon, Paris. From <i>Quinze Lithographies</i>. A very good impression of this extremely scarce lithograph. <br><br>Degas (1834-1917) was likely influenced to collaborate with the lithographer Thornley by Theo Van Gogh (1857-1891), the influential director of the Boussod-Valadon Gallery in Paris, and as a result of Thornley's masterful lithographic interpretations of drawings by Puvis de Chavannes (1824-1898). By 1888, Degas and Thornley were working together to produce a portfolio of 15 lithographs based on drawings by Degas. The portfolio was issued in 1889 in an edition of 100, plus an additional deluxe edition of 25 with each of the prints signed by both artists. Reed/Shapiro p. lvii."
