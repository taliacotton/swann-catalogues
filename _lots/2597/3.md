TYPESET: "Etching and engraving printed in dark brown, 1807.  184x260 mm; 7¼x10¼ inches, full margins.  Second state (of 5).  From <i>Liber Studiorum</i>.  A superb, richly-inked, early impression.  <br><br><i>Jason</i> is part of a series of 81 prints created by Turner (1775-1851) and other printmakers, after his oils, that have come to be known as the <i>Liber Studiorum</i> (Book of Studies, in Latin).  This series is based on original watercolors by Turner derived from his paintings, essentially a visual catalogue <i>raisonné</i> of all his works.<br><br>History, literature and myth were profound sources of inspiration for Turner.  This particular composition derives from Apollonius Rhodius's epic Greek poem, <i>Argonautica</i>, written in the 3rd century BCE.  The tale chronicles mythical Greek hero Jason and his voyage to retrieve the legendary Golden Fleece.  In Turner's depiction, Jason scales a fallen tree to approach the dragon guarding the Fleece.  <i>Argonautica</i> profoundly influenced Latin poets like Catullus and Ovid, and it served as a framework for Virgil's Roman national epic, the <i>Aeneid</i>.  Finberg 6."
