Signed and dated in ink, lower right recto.<br><br>Provenance: Camillos Kouros Gallery, New York, with the label on the frame back; private collection, New York.<br><br>Xceron (1890-1967) emigrated from Greece to the United States when he was fourteen years old.  He studied drawing at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington D.C. where he perfected his skills as a draftsman.  However, after encounters with European modernism Xceron became fascinated with flat color, expressive distortion, and cubist renderings.  He moved to New York in 1920, exhibiting in the New York Independentsâ€™ exhibitions in 1921 and 1922, and spent many years in Paris in the late 20's and early 30's.  His work underwent many stylistic changes throughout his life, though he is best-known for his dynamic compositions of geometric forms and vibrant colors.  Xceron was also an active art critic, writing articles for the <i>Boston Evening Transcript</i> and the Paris edition of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>."
