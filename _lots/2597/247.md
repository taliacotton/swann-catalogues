  Pompon</i>, Paris, 1994, page 194, number 52. <br><br><i>Coq dormant</i> was designed
  by Pompon (1855-1933) in 1914, before he found success as an independent sculptor
  (he had served as a studio assistant for Auguste Rodin from 1890-1897).   Between
  1918 and 1932, Fonderie Hébrard cast <i>Coq Dormant</i> in five editions, numbered
  1 to 10, A1 to A10, B1 to B10, C1 to C10, and D1 to D6.  Pompon''s work, relying
  on streamlined, fluid forms, was finally publicly acclaimed at the 1922 <i>Salon
  d''Automne</i> with his exhibition of <i>Ours blanc (Polar Bear)</i>.'
