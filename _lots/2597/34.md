TYPESET: "Etching and drypoint printed in dark brownish black on antique cream laid paper, 1878.  275x152 mm; 10â…žx6 inches, full margins.  MacDonald's fourth state (of 4), before cancellation.  Edition of approximately only 30.  A superb, early, richly-inked impression of this scarce etching, with very strong contrasts and with the delicate drypoint clouds in the sky and the butterfly signature lower left distinct.<br><br>Whistler (1834-1903) drew this scene directly on an etching plate, from a balcony at the Albemarle Hotel looking down St. James's Street.  The etching was commissioned by <i>Vanity Fair</i>, where it was ultimately reproduced by lithographic transfer; Whistler used the commission to help offset financial troubles stemming from the libel suit against the art critic John Ruskin.  Kennedy 169; Glasgow 178."
