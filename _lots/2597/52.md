Signed in pencil, upper left verso.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection, New York.<br><br>Several of the sketches on this lively sheet of studies might relate to Spitzweg's oil painting <i>Türken in einem Kaffeehaus</i>, circa 1855, now in the Sammlung Schack, Munich.<br><br>Spitzweg (1808-1885) was a German romanticist painter of the Biedermeier era.  He was originally trained as a pharmacist, studying at the University of Munich, but dedicated himself fully to painting upon receiving an inheritance and recovering from an illness.  Spitzweg was a self-taught painter and traveled widely through Europe studying art independently.  The Biedermeier style flourished in Central Europe from 1815 to 1848, a time where the middle class grew and art reflected an air of leisure and comfort of the time.  Spitzweg's work, and Biedermeier art in general, commonly depicted warm, idyllic and sentimental genre scenes of middle class life."
