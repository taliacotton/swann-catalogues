  titled, annotated and numbered 110/150 by Georgette Magritte, the artist's wife,
  in pencil, lower right.  Printed by Mourlot, Paris, with the blind stamp lower right.  A
  very good impression of this large lithograph with strong colors.</p><p>Based on
  Magritte's (1898-1967) same-titled oil painting from 1964 now in a private collection.  <em>Le
  Fils de l'Homme </em> (or <em>The Son of Man</em>) was painted by Magritte as a
  self-portrait.  Among his most famous paintings, the subject was used in this collaborative
  lithograph between the artist's estate, under the direction of the artist's widow
  Georgette Magritte, and the renowned Parisian lithographer Fernand Mourlot.</p><p>The
  green apple which alludes to the painting's title, a Biblical reference to Adam,
  and figures so prominently in the image, floating in front of the man's face, was
  a repeated motif in Magritte's work.  It was also used in his 1966 oil painting
  <em>Le Jeu De Morre, </em>owned by musician Paul McCartney, which purportedly inspired
  the Beatles to name their record company "Apple Corps," and then in turn prompted
  Steve Jobs to designate his company "Apple Computer."</p>
