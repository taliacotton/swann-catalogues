DESCRIPT: KÄTHE KOLLWITZ
CROSSHEAD: Die Klage.
year: 1940
TYPESET: 'Bronze, 1939-41.   266x248x102 mm; 10½x9¾x4 inches.  Inscribed with the
  artist''s signature and with the foundry mark Cire perdue A.A. Hébrard, Paris, and
  stamped "H. NOACK BERLIN" on the left edge.<br><br>Published: Seeler, <i>Käthe Kollwitz
  - Die Plastik</i>, 2019, number 38 (another cast illustrated).<br><br><i>Die Klage</i>,
  or <i>The Lament</i>, was created by Kollwitz (1867-1945) in reaction to Nazi dictatorship,
  which had ostracized many of her colleagues and family members, including sculptor
  Ernst Barlach (1870-1938).  The sculpture served as a tribute to Barlach and a self-portrait
  of Kollwitz.  Both Barlach and Kollwitz were silenced as artists when their works
  were confiscated in 1936 by the Nazis, this is symbolized by the hand covering the
  mouth.  The other hand, covering one eye, represents how one could momentarily turn
  away from the suffering at the hands of the regime, but it was ever present and
  could not be ignored.<br><br>The plaster cast of <i>Die Klage</i>, conceived by
  Kollwitz from 1939-41, arrived at the Noack Foundry, Berlin, before 1942 when Kollwitz
  had two zinc casts made.  According the Seeler, it is unclear if these casts have
  survived, as a 1944 letter from Kollwitz indicates that a cast was damaged or destroyed,
  though Noack created post-war bronzes into the 1980s.  <br><br>Since Kollwitz''s
  death, owing to the popularity of the image, there have been numerous castings of
  <i>Die Klage</i> made by both European and American foundries.  Since the dimensions
  and the survival of the original cast are unclear, it is difficult to ascertain
  from what source cast many of these editions originate.  The Boston art dealer Hyman
  Swetzoff obtained a plaster cast for <i>Die Klage</i> in 1956 and had a version  made
  at the Roman Bronze Works, New York in 1961-62.  Posthumous casts were also likely
  made from a bronze owned by Hans Kollwitz.  Heilborn 89; Guratzsch 59; Seeler 38.'
