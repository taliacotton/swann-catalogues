Published in <i>Les Mots en Liberté Futuristes</i>, Milan.<br><br>The tenets of Marinetti's (1876-1944) \"Typographic Revolution\" (1913) are visually set forth in his typographic masterpiece, <i>Les Mots en Liberté Futuristes (The Futurist Words in Freedom)</i>. The book, considered the peak of Marinetti's typographic experimentation, contains a creative variety of hand-designed typefaces, calligraphy and dynamic layouts.  In this print, Marinetti depicts Italy's victory in World War I, using <i>tavole parolibere</i> (free-word pictures), a form of Futurist wordplay in which numbers, letters and signs are liberated from their functionality to create compelling visual compositions."
