TYPESET: "Oil on board, 1909.  226x292mm; 9x11Â½ inches.  Signed and dated in oil, upper right recto.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection, New York.  <br><br>Sterl (1867-1932) was a prolific German painter.  He was born in Dresden and attended the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, later becoming a founding member of the Dresden Secession.  Sterl worked as a war painter during the First World War.  Afterwards he moved to Struppen, in Saxony, where he continued painting, often creating socially-conscious work.  In 1937, two of his paintings were labeled \"degenerate\" by the Nazi Party and were removed from the Galerie Neue Meister in Dresden.  This painting of three stonemasons is representative of one of Sterl's most beloved subjects; he painted many scenes of workers, especially quarrymen, sympathetic to their labor since his father was also a stonemason."
