  state (of 3).  Edition of 100.  Signed in pencil, lower center.  Printed and published

  superb impression of this scarce lithograph with strong colors.  <br><br>Provenance:
  Alfred H. Barr Jr., founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Renee
  M. Arb, the art critic and founder of University of Massachusetts Boston''s art
  department; thence by descent to the current owner, private collection New York.<br><br>The
  present impression of <i>Der Verliebte</i>, or <i>The Lover</i> was a telling gift
  from Alfred H.  Barr, Jr. to the art critic and founder of University of Massachusetts
  Boston''s art department, Renee M. Arb, with whom he had a close relationship during
  the 1940s and 1950s.  At the time of this gift, Arb had helped launch the career
  of painter Willem de Kooning, capturing the essence of his artistic trajectory and
  inducing Barr to begin acquiring the artist''s work for the MoMA.  During her career,
  at <i>ARTnews</i>, Dr. Arb was credited with being the first to acknowledge Willem
  de Kooning''s work in 1948 in what his wife Elaine de Kooning recalled as a "prophetic"
  review of the artist''s first solo exhibition in New York.  Kornfeld 94.'
