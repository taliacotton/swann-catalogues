In 1933, Jooss fled Germany and toured throughout Europe with the company, eventually settling in Devonshire, England to open a dance school at Dartington Hall in 1934.  Jooss and the company were based at Dartington until 1940, contemporaneous to Tobey's residency at Dartington Hall from 1931-38.  Tobey painted a mural for the dance school in 1933 for which the present drawing may have been a preliminary study."
