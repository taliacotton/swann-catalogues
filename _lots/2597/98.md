  artist, Mora; the sitter, Frederick Keppel, New York, with the black ink stamp (Lugt
  1023, lower left verso); private collection, Florida.<br><br>A preparatory drawing
  for Zorn''s (1860-1920) etching, <i>Frederick Keppel I</i> (see Asplund 141; Hjert/Hjert
  92).  Keppel (1845-1912) was an important gallerist in New York at the forefront
  of the Etching Revival in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  He was born in
  Tullow, Ireland and studied at Wesley College, Dublin.  He and his family moved
  to Canada and then to the United States in 1862.  Early on Keppel resolved to be
  a farmer, but he sustained an injury that prevented him from most physical labor.  He
  remembered, "Next after farming I think I liked books best, and so I made my way
  to New York and engaged in that most interesting business, a bookseller''s."  Keppel
  arrived in New York and opened Frederick Keppel & Company in 1868.  Though at first
  having no knowledge of fine art prints, Keppel found his way into initially selling
  portfolios.  Through his relationships abroad and his ability to lecture and write
  about the subject, Keppel nurtured the public''s interest in prints, launching numerous
  publications of artist''s works and the <i>Print-Collector''s Quarterly</i> in 1911.  He
  was known to have forged friendships with the artists he represented, notably Zorn,
  James A. M. Whistler, Jean-François Millet, Fèlix Buhot and Joseph Pennell.  Like
  many of those who knew Whistler, Keppel had a frought relationship with the artist,
  Keppel''s pamphlet, </i>The Gentle Art of Resenting Injuries</i> was a direct, albeit
  entertaining, response to Whistler''s <i>The Gentle Art of Making Enemies</i>.'
