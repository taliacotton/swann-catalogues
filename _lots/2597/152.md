  \ A superb, well-inked impression of this large etching with strong contrasts.</p><p>Moran
  (1837-1926) visited Venice for the first time in May 1886 and, like many other artists,
  was captivated by the color and light, previously only known to him through descriptive
  Romantic literary works, views by earlier artists like Joseph M. W. Turner and photographs.
  \ Moran made numerous sketches in watercolor and oil studies in Venice which he
  translated into large oil paintings once back in his New York studio.  He compounded
  the popularity of these dramatic oils of Venice among American art patrons by also
  issuing deluxe editions of etchings, made in collaboration with professional printmakers,
  which he signed in pencil to give his stamp of approval.  Klackner 61.</p>"
