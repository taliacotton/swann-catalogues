Published by Galerie Berheim-Jeune, Paris. A superb impression with strong colors.<br><br>Rousseau (1844-1910) was a French self-taught Post-impressionist painter. He is nicknamed <i>Le Douanier</i> (the customs officer) from his career as a toll and tax collector. Rousseau began painting after his retirement and is best known for his jungle scenes rendered in a Primitive style. He never traveled outside of France, but was deeply inspired by zoos and botanical gardens in France, as well as tableaux of taxidermied wild animals, claiming that he had \"no teacher other than nature.\" Ridiculed by critics for most of his art career, Rousseau was unaffected by the negative feedback and continued to paint and show his work. Pablo Picasso happened upon a painting of Rousseau's in 1908 and immediately recognized his talent; he proceeded to meet with Rousseau and host a banquet in his studio in Rousseau's honor. Ginestet/Pouillon 641."
