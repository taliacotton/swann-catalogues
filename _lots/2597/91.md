Published by Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, with the blind stamp lower left. A brilliant impression with strong colors.<br><br>This is based on Van Gogh's (1853-1890) oil painting from 1890 now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. According to the National Gallery of Art, \"<i>Roses</i> was painted shortly before Van Gogh's release from the asylum at Saint–Rémy. He felt he was coming to terms with his illness—and himself. In this healing process, painting was all–important. During those final three weeks of his recovery, he wrote his brother Theo, he had 'worked as in a frenzy. Great bunches of flowers, violet irises, big bouquets of roses . . .' This is one of two rose paintings Van Gogh made at that time. It is among his largest and most beautiful still lifes, with an exuberant bouquet in the glory of full bloom. Although he sometimes assigned certain meanings to flowers, Van Gogh did not make a specific association for roses. It is clear, though, that he saw all blossoming plants as celebrations of birth and renewal--as full of life. That sense is underscored here by the fresh spring green of the background.\"  Ginestet/Pouillon 651 (Villon)."
