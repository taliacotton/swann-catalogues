Signed in oil, upper left recto.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection, New York.<br><br>Mané-Katz (1894-1962) was a Litvak painter born in Kremenchuk, Ukraine.  He moved to Paris in 1913 where he befriended fellow artists including Chaïm Soutine and Pablo Picasso, and studied at the École des Beaux-Arts.  He first traveled to Jerusalem in 1928, and while he moved often, he considered Israel his sacred home and died in Tel Aviv.  <br><br>Jewish shtetl life was a common theme in his work.  Mané-Katz often portrayed scenes of musicians, such as this Klezmer band scene, which depicts a typical performance in Eastern European villages before World War II and the Holocaust.  Throughout his <i>oeuvre</i> Mané-Katz captured the richness and vibrance of Eastern European Jewish culture."
