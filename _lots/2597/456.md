CROSSHEAD: Natura morta con cinque oggetti.
year: 1956
TYPESET: Etching on cream wove paper, 1956.  140x195 mm; 5½x7⅞ inches, full margins.  Third
  state (of 4).  Signed and numbered 56/150 in pencil, lower margin.  A superb, richly-inked
  impression of this scarce etching.<br><br>The primary focus of Morandi's (1890-1964)
  <i>œuvre</i> is simple, muted still lives.  He taught himself the basics of printmaking
  in the early 1910s after admiring the work of Old Masters such as Rembrandt van
  Rijn (1606-1669) and Francisco José de Goya (1746-1828).  His etchings reflect his
  unique practice of hatching and cross-hatching to build form and volume, avoiding
  descriptive outlines.  This, paired with the areas of <i>bianco assoluto</i>, or
  "absolute white," that he left in his etchings, created atmospheric, contemporaneous
  still lives.  He taught etching at the Accademia di Belle Arti, Bologna from 1930-56,
  and in his lifetime, he completed some 1350 oil paintings and 133 etchings.  Vitali
