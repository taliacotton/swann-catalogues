A very good impression of this scarce print with strong colors.<br><br>Veysset (1913-1967) studied at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts de Paris and began as a sculptor in the academic style before turning to Expressionism and ultimately abstraction by the late 1940s.  In 1949, he participated in the <i>Salon de la jeune sculpture</i> at the Musée Rodin, Paris.  During the mid-20th century, he exhibited in the popular <i>Salon des Réalités Nouvelles</i> at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, along with Jean Arp and Sonia Delaunay.  Veysset became one of the main proponents of mid-century \"Archi-Sculpture\" and a leading French abstract sculptor.  In 1953, he was selected to contribute to the Mémorial des Martyrs de la Déportation, Paris, in collaboration with the architect Georges-Henri Pingusson, a memorial to the 200,000 people who were deported from Vichy France to the Nazi concentration camps during World War II.  However, Veysset pulled out of the project (inaugurated by Charles de Gaulle in 1962) in 1957 due to his contention with its significant modification."
