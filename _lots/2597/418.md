The current work exemplifies Dalí's grotesque yet meticulous artistic style, which developed during the political tumult and Spanish Civil War of the 1930s and 1940s and which he maintained over the course of his career.<br><br>This ink drawing recalls his 1940 oil painting <i>Daddy Longlegs of the Evening—Hope!</i>, now in the Salvador Dalí Museum, St. Petersburg, Florida, which includes a similar horse and winged Nike/Victory of Samothrace motifs."
