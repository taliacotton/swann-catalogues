TYPESET: "Lithograph on antique cream laid paper, 1895. 190x140 mm; 7½x5½ inches, full margins.  Fortuna watermark (Spink 151).  A superb impression of this extremely scarce lithograph.<br><br>Likely one of the 37 impressions printed by Goulding in 1904 for Rosalind Bernie Philip, the artist's sister-in-law.<br><br>We have found only 3 other impressions at auction in the past 30 years. <br><br>Sickert (1860-1942) became Whistler's (1834-1903) student and assistant in 1882.  The two were said to have a tumultuous relationship with two distinct working styles; Whistler being the legendary perfectionist.  They often worked from the same model, though Sickert's painting tended to lend itself more to the Impressionist style.  Sickert and Whistler became estranged in October 1896 after the former failed to apologize for associating with Sir William Eden, with whom Whistler had a lawsuit (Whistler was unsatisfied with the payment he received for <i>Brown and Gold: Portrait of Lady Eden</i> and refused to release the painting to Eden).  In what seemed like a reciprocal blow, Whistler sided against Sickert when artist Joseph Pennell (1857-1926) brought a libel action against him in 1897.  Despite their complicated interpersonal relationships, Pennell and Sickert knew Whistler best, and worked to authenticate his works after his death.  As the University of Glasgow states, however, \"either through a lack of judgement, scrupulousness, or, in Sickert's case, from sheer devilment, authentications by them are by no means reliable.\" Way 79; Levy 118; Spink 115."
