  Vienna, will include this work in the supplement to Alice Strobl’s catalogue <i>raisonné</i>
  of Gustav Klimt’s drawings.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection, New York.<br><br>Klimt
  (1862-1918), a leader of the Vienna Secession movement, rejected the academic style
  that was prevalent in Austria and most of Europe at the turn of the century. His
  artwork often incorporated undulating contour lines and stylized forms as well as
  heavy ornamentation and symbolism. This individual expression was lauded by Vienna''s
  cultural circles in the last decade of the 19th century and the early 1900s and
  served as a significant influence on Klimt''s younger contemporaries.  This drawing
  relates to Klimt''s most recognized work, <i>The Kiss<i> and another painting, <i>Fulfillment</i>,
  as he was developing compositions for similar themes at the time.'
