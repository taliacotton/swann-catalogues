Printed by Way, London. <br><br>According to Spink, et als, apparently Whistler's (1834-1903) \"first representation in lithography of the female figure in motion.\"  They cite one other impression similarly signed and annotated with a number in Whistler's hand, now in the Hunterian Museum, University of Glasgow.  A superb, early impression of this very scarce lithograph, with the dark inking along the edge of the robe near the right arm and with all the subtle tonal variations distinct.  Way 30; Levy 45; Spink 29."
