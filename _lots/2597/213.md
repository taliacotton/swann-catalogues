Morales is best known for his brightly colored surrealistic dream-like canvases and collages, made at the height of his career, often featuring Mexican women in village settings.  He was notable for his restoration of historic buildings in Ocotlán de Morelos and, together with Rufino Tamayo and Francisco Toledo, helped make Oaxaca in Southern Mexico a center for contemporary art and tourism.<br><br>A similar painting, and possibly a pendant to the current work, was sold at Bonhams, New York, November 7, 2011, lot 39."
