Published by La Guilde de Gravure, Paris, with the blind stamp lower left.  A superb impression with vibrant colors.<br><br>In 1910, at the invitation of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Umberto Boccioni, Severini (1883-1966) signed the <i>Manifesto tecnico della pittura futurista</i>, cementing his role in the Italian Futurist movement. Living in Paris, he became an important link between France and Italy for the Futurists, and organized the first Futurist exhibition outside of Italy at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris in 1912.  Aiming to depict the dynamism of modern life, many artists in the movement depicted burgeoning technology such as cars or machines.  Severini, on the other hand, leaned towards depicting the human figure in movement (often in dance).  After World War I, Severini moved on from Futurism, embracing Synthetic Cubism, and later, a Neoclassical style.  Meloni 28."
