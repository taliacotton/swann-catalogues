Signed in pencil, lower left recto.<br><br>Provenance: World House Galleries, New York, with the label on the frame back; private collection, New York.<br><br>Pirandello (1899-1975) was an Italian painter belonging to the modern movement of the Scuola Romana (Roman School).  He was the son of Nobel laureate Luigi Pirandello.  After a short experience in Paris, where he met the central artistic personalities of the time between 1920 and 1930, Pirandello entered the movement of Scuola Romana, distinguishing himself for originality and solitary exploration.  His painting tends towards a quotidian realism manifested at times in the more unpleasant and pitiless aspects of life, expressed through a dense and thorny pictorial matter."
