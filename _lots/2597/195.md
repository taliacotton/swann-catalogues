TYPESET: "Etching, circa 1930.  127x98 mm; 5x3⅞ inches.  Signed and numbered 1/1 in pencil, lower margin.  A superb impression of this exceedingly scarce, early etching.<br><br>Gorky (1904-1948) was a profound figure in American art, celebrated for his blending of European Surrealism into Abstract Expressionism.  He is considered one of the first Abstract Expressionists, paving the way to the movement with his highly original, lyrical and rhythmic compositions.  Gorky, born as Vostanik Manoog Adoyanm, emigrated to the U.S. in 1920 and changed his name to escape the Armenian genocide.  He studied at the New School of Design in Boston, and the Grand Central School of Art in New York.  His work evolved drastically throughout his career as he studied the works of artists he admired, such as Pablo Picasso, Paul Cézanne and Joan Miró.  Gorky stressed the importance of studying from the masters and came to his distinct style through years of continuous experimentation and innovation."
