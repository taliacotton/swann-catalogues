TYPESET: "Oil on canvas, circa 1814.  476x376 mm; 18¾x14¾ inches.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection, New York.<br><br>Granet (1775-1849) was a French painter and curator known for his paintings of church and convent interiors.  He was born in Aix-en-Provence, studied art in France, and relocated to Italy where he lived for 21 years as a member of a French artist community, including Neoclassical painters Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780-1867) and François-Xavier Fabre (1766-1837).  Granet created this composition during Napoleon's occupation of Rome, when the Capuchin order had been banished from the seventeenth-century church in the city center.  Granet mourned the peaceful cloister before it was dissolved and sought to capture its serenity.  Among his most favored subjects, he claimed that he painted different iterations of <i>Santa Maria dell'Immacolata Concezione</i> at least fifteen times."
