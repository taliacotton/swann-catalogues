  Published by Goupil, Paris. From <i>L'Album de 20 lithographies d'après les tableaux
  de Claude Monet</i>. A very good, dark impression of this scarce lithograph.<br><br>At
  the end of the 19th century, Monet (1840-1926), Edgar Degas (1834-1917) and Camille
  Pissarro (1830-1903) rediscovered lithography as a medium both to recreate their
  artistic conceptions on paper and, simultaneously achieve widespread distribution
  of and acclamation for their work. These artists, who had invented new ways of transmitting
  impressions of light and color, engaged George William Thornley (1857-1935), an
  accomplished English lithographer and admirer of the Impressionists, to translate
  their designs into lithographs. The prints that emerged from these collaborative
  efforts are the only lithographs in color, save one by Pissarro, by these great
  Impressionist artists.<br><br>Until he met Thornley, Monet had evidenced no interest
  in making prints. Unlike Degas and Pissarro, who etched on copper and drew on stone
  or transfer paper, or Cézanne, Sisley and Renoir, who collaborated with Auguste
  Clot, the talented Parisian master printer, to create color lithographs, Monet either
  found printmaking too daunting or did not seek the public acclaim for his work that
  printmaking could provide. However, he was able to find a hospitable partner in
  Thornley. The resulting collaborative lithographs of landscapes, seascapes and portraits
  are informed with the elusive and shimmering light of his iconic Impressionist oil
  paintings.<br><br>This lithograph is based on Monet's 1886 oil painting of Guillaume
  Poly. The sitter is a local fisherman who frequently visited the inn where Monet
  was staying while he was working at Belle-Île-en-Mer in 1886.
