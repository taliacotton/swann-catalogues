TYPESET: "Lithograph, 1924.  615x475 mm; 24¼x18¾ inches, full margins.  Signed and numbered 43/50 in pencil, lower margin.  A superb, evenly-printed impression of this large, important lithograph with strong contrasts. <br><br>Though famous for his paintings and sculptures, Matisse (1869-1954) was also a prolific printmaker, producing over 800 individual prints (typically in editions of 25 to 50) from 1900 to 1954. He moved freely between various printmaking techniques and used printmaking as an extension of his drawing style and process. The imagery he created often was repeated forms of reclining nudes, portraits or dancing bodies drawn with elegant and energetic contour lines.<br><br>Matisse found printmaking to be an exciting medium that allowed innovation while also enabling him to produce works in multiples to satisfy the increasing demand for his art. The wide dissemination and demand for Matisse's printed work undoubtedly contributed immensely to his position as a preeminent artist of the 20th century.<br><br>This lithograph is based on Matisse's same-titled oil painting, also from 1924, formerly in the collection of Mrs. Sidney F. Brody (sold Christie's, New York, May 4, 2010, lot 22).  In this pose, considered iconic for Matisse, the model appears to make look effortless what is a difficult and somewhat exerting position, revisited by Matisse at the end of his career in the more abstract, blue nude cut-outs from the early 1950s.  Duthuit 442."
