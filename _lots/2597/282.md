A very good impression.  <br><br>Brothers Aldo, Piero, and Milan Crommelynck were responsible for printing an astonishing 45 percent of Pablo Picasso’s intaglio prints.  Piero (or Pierre), the youngest brother, who bore a resemblance to Don Quixote, was the model for numerous Picasso portraits from the 1960s-70s and his likeness was used for Picasso’s bearded musketeer who appears frequently in the Celestine images of the <i>347 Gravures</i>. The Crommelynck family were instrumental in Picasso’s late-career productivity and kept up with the aging artist’s relentless pace.  Bloch 1378; Baer 1400."
