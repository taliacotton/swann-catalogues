TYPESET: "Black and white chalks on tan wove paper, 1916.  495x247 mm; 19⅝x9⅞ inches.  Signed, dated and dedicated \"A mon cher ami Alexandre Mercereau\" in black chalk, lower left recto.<br><br>Provenance: Alexandre Mercereau, Paris; Galerie Antoine Laurentin, Paris; private collection, New York. <br><br>The dedicatee Alexandre Mercereau (1884-1945) was a French Symbolist poet and critic who co-founded the utopian community <I>Abbaye de Créteil</i> during the fall of 1906.  According to his friend and fellow <i>Abbaye de Créteil</i> founder, the artist Albert Gleizes (1881-1953), Mercereau was responsible for introducing him to Jean Metzinger (1883-1956), Robert Delaunay (1885-1941) and Henri Le Fauconnier (1881-1946) in 1910—the same year that Mercereau curated and included these artists in a Moscow exhibition, probably the first <i>Knave of Diamonds Exhibition</i>, a foundational moment in the Cubist art movement.  By 1914, Mercereau had met the Spanish sculptor and pioneer of Cubism Julio González and became his lifelong supporter and friend."
