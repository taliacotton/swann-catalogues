  Lucien Goldschmidt, New York; private collection, New York.<br><br>Bakst (1866-1924)
  was a revolutionary theatre and costume designer.  He served as the artistic director
  of the renowned dance company, the Ballets Russes, for which he designed groundbreaking
  sets and costumes.  Bakst rejected the formal and muted sensibilities in traditional
  ballet, introducing vibrant colors, unique forms and an emphasis on emotion and
  sensuality.  Audiences were swept away by this "new ballet" and Bakst gained international
  fame, creating designs for numerous productions until his death.'
