  Serge Sabarsky Gallery, New York; Nielsen Gallery, Boston; private collection, Massachusetts,
  1977; private collection, Chicago.<br><br>Published:  Werner, <i>Gustav Klimt, One
  Hundred Drawings</i>, New York, 1972, number 42 (illustrated); Strobl, <i>Gustav
  Klimt: Die Zeichnungen, 1904-1912</i>, Salzburg, 1982, volume II, page 113, number
  1542 (illustrated).<br><br>In her 1982 catalogue, Strobl calls this work and others
  of the same subject—striding female nudes—from around the same time period, "Stylized,
  yet full of life from head to toe."  She notes that while no specific painting by
  Klimt (1862-1918) has been identified for which this and the other similar drawings
  are known to be studies, they may relate to the <i>Stoclet Frieze</i>, a series
  of three mosaics created by Klimt for a 1905-11 commission for the Palais Stoclet
  in Brussels. The panels depict a swirling <i>Tree of Life</i>, a standing female
  figure and an embracing couple.'
