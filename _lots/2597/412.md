Signed and numbered 89 in ink on the justification page.  Published by Galerie Jeanne Bucher, Paris.  Original pasteboard folder.  Very good impressions.<br><br>According to the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Ernst (1891-1976) created these images by placing paper atop various materials—wood floorboards, lengths of twine, leaves, wire mesh, crumpled paper, crusts of bread—and rubbing the surface with a pencil or crayon. Inspired by the resulting textures, he added details to transform them into fantastical landscapes, objects, and creatures.  Ernst called his process <i>frottage</i> (French for “rubbing”) and claimed it as a form of Surrealist automatism, whereby an artist attempts to let the unconscious guide his hand in the creation of an image."
