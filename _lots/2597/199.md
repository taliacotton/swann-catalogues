Experimenting with this in his only work produced outside of continental America, <i>Desocupado</i> (or <i>Unemployed—Paris</i>), 1932, Orozco diluted the liquid to achieve a watercolor affect and also put it on thickly, scratching away parts of it with a needle for greater characterization in detail.\"  Hopkins 22."
