  (1728-1779) was born in Bohemia, present-day Czech Republic, to a family of artists.  His
  father, who trained him, was a court painter in Dresden.  In 1740, Mengs moved with
  his father to Rome, where the young artist learned to emulate Raphael and Correggio
  and established himself as a precocious talent.  Mengs moved back to Dresden in
  1744 to build his career before settling in Rome in 1752, where he stayed for the
  rest of his life.  With art historian and Hellenist Johann Joachim Winckelmann,
  Mengs helped to revive interest in classical antiquity.  Mengs heralded Neoclassicism,
  the style championed by artists into the early 19th century and beyond.  This pared
  down, simplistic style rooted in symmetry, was also practiced by Jacques-Louis David
  (1748-1825) and Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780-1867).'
