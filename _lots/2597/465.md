Signed in ink, lower left recto.  <br><br>Provenance: Private collection, New York.<br><br>Venard (1913-1999) Venard was a French post-Cubist and still life painter.  Known for working in a distinctive angular style, he accentuated the chromatic qualities of his palette through thickly applied impasto paint.  He enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts, but abandoned his studies after only two days--instead, his arts education would come from his work as an assistant to a master  paintings restorer at the Musée du Louvre, Paris.<br><br>In 1936, Venard participated in a group exhibition for a new art movement that derided the <i>avant-garde</i> in favor of a return to strict and traditional principles of craftsmanship: the <i>Forces Nouvelles</i>, a group which included the painters Pierre Tal-Coat and André Marchand.  Eventually Venard would develope his own post-Cubist style utilizing a wide color palette applied roughly with a palette knife, creating a visceral strain of the geometric aesthetic.<br><br>Throughout the 1950s, Venard’s paintings became more abstracted, as in this current scene of Venice.  The artist’s works are included in the collections of the Tate Gallery, London; the Metropolitan Museum of Art,  New York; and the Tokyo Museum."
