His early work reflects his studies of Fauvism and German Expressionism, and he later became deeply influenced by Cubism during his time in Paris in the 1910s.  He was close friends with Picasso during this time and drew on his groundbreaking work.  Filla later returned to Prague to teach at the Academy of Art, Architecture and Design and owing to his influence, Prague became known as the second most important center for Cubism after Paris."
