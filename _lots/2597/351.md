  in Gnoien, Mecklenburg, and moved to Rostock with his family when he was a youth.  There
  he worked as a scene painter for the theater, until he was recruited into the military
  in 1918.  When he returned from his time in the service, he attended the School
  of Applied Arts in Hannover and opened his own studio there in 1924.  He exhibited
  works at the Art Association in Hannover in 1927, and, in 1929, he was included
  in the Neue Sachlichkeit exhibit in Amsterdam.  His work was shown infrequently
  between 1933 and 1945, but at the end of the war Wegner became an instructor at
  the Vollkshochschule in Hannover.  His work appeared in numerous exhibitions throughout
  Europe over the next few decades.  A retrospective exhibition of his work was held
  at the Art Association in Hannover in 1970."'
