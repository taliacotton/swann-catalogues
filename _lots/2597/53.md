  Whatman Turkey Mill and the date 1832 watermark.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection,
  Chicago.<br><br>Planned by Doré (1832-1883) as early as 1855, the Dante illustrations
  were the first in an intended series that he referred to as the <i>chefs-d''oeuvre
  de la littérature</i>.  In addition to Dante, Doré''s list of illustrated great
  works included Homer, Ossian, Byron, Goethe, Racine and Corneille.  The placement
  of Dante''s <i>Commedia</i> at the top of this list reflects the poet''s popularity
  within mainstream French culture by the 1850s, and in particular the Romantic infatuation
  with the love story of Paolo and Francesca.<br><br>In the Second Circle of Hell
  in Dante''s <i>Inferno</i>, Dante and Virgil pass into a dark place in which torrential
  rains fall ceaselessly and gales of wind tear through the air.  The souls of the
  damned in this circle swirl about in the wind, swept helplessly through the stormy
  air.  These are the lustful—those who committed sins of the flesh.  Dante asks Virgil
  to identify some of the individual souls to him; they include many of great renown,
  including Helen, for whose sake the Trojan War was fought, and Cleopatra. Dante
  immediately feels sympathy for these souls, for essentially, they are damned by
  love.  With Virgil’s permission, he calls out to the souls to see if they will speak
  to him and tell him their story. One woman, Francesca, recognizes Dante as a living
  soul and answers him.  She relates to him how love was her undoing: bound in marriage
  to an old and deformed man, she eventually fell in love with Paolo da Rimini, her
  husband’s younger brother.  One day, as she and Paolo sat reading an Arthurian legend
  about the love of Lancelot and Guinevere, each began to feel that the story spoke
  to their own secret love.  When they came to a particularly romantic moment in the
  story, they could not resist kissing.  Francesca’s husband quickly discovered their
  transgression and had the young lovers killed.  Now Paolo and Francesca are doomed
  to spend eternity in the Second Circle of Hell.  Overcome with pity, Dante faints.'
