TYPESET: "Color woodcut, circa 1925.  305x243 mm; 12x9½ inches, full margins.  Signed, titled and inscribed \"imp\" in pencil, lower margin.<br><br>Smith (1866-1959) born in Philadelphia, was a painter, printmaker and successful children's book illustrator.  She was a member of the pioneering woodblock print society–the first of its kind in America–known as the Provincetown Printers.  This small group of printmakers came together in 1915 in the artistic community of Provincetown on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, which had become a destination for <i>avante-garde</i> American artists and European artists fleeing the turmoil of World War I.  The group remains most noteworthy for having innovated the white-line woodcut print, known as “the Provincetown Print.”  Smith exhibited her work regularly in Provincetown in the 1920s and 1930s, as well as at her summer art colony in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, and the Woodmere Art Museum, Philadelphia."
