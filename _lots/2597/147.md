  has confirmed the authenticity of this work.<br><br>Rodin''s (1840-1917) drawings
  and works on paper rarely served as preliminary sketches for his sculptures, in
  fact the majority were created by Rodin studying his own earlier sculptures or that
  by other artists, including Michelangelo.  Rodin simplified these figures to near
  abstraction and often floated them against a wash of color on the sheet, creating
  dynamism by removing context.'
