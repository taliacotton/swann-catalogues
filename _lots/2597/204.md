  City.<br><br>This linoleum cut by Méndez (1902-1969) calls to attention the deportation
  of the masses of the persecuted population of Europe to Nazi concentration camps
  during World War II. Founded by Méndez and other artists in Mexico City in 1937,
  the Taller de Gráfica Popular was committed to spreading anti-Fascist messages through
  linoleum cuts, a less expensive and more widely-accessible printmaking technique.</p><p>Assisting
  the Liga Pro Cultura Alemana, an anti-Nazi organization established in Mexico in
  1938, the Taller de Gráfica Popular workshop targeted what it saw as the two pillars
  of nazism: systematic use of terror and antisemitism.</p><p>This image was used
  as an illustration in 1943 for, <em>El Libro negro del terror nazi en Europa</em>
  (or <em>The Black Book of Nazi Terror in Europe</em>).</p>"
