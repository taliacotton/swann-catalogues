DESCRIPT: LEE, HARPER.
CROSSHEAD: To Kill A Mockingbird.
at-a-glance: 'Philadelphia & New York: Lippincott, (1960) [but c. 1962]'
TYPESET: '8vo, publisher''s light green Â¼ cloth-backed grey paper boards, spine tips
  lightly faded; price-clipped dust jacket, twenty-second printing, spotting to flaps,
  folds and corners rubbed, scattered creasing; custom clamshell box. <i>Twenty-third
  impression, presentation copy, signed and inscribed by both Lee and Horton Foote</i>
  to Margaret MacDonnell, a long-time production assistant with Universal Pictures,
  who worked with both writers on the film adaptation. On the front free endpaper
  it reads "To Margaret: / With my love and / best wishes, / Harper Lee"; the rear
  endpaper: "For Margaret / with gratitude & / thanks for her / patience - / Horton
  Foote." Lee and Foote famously worked closely together on the film''s script and
  enjoyed a long friendship aside from this famous and enormously successfull collaboration.
  The film was released in 1962 and this later impression closely corresponds with
  the timing of the film. It won three Academy Awards, including Foote garnering the
  Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. Certainly among the finest association copies
  of this iconic title.'
