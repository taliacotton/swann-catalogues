FOOTNOTE: '". . . I was in China . . . and on returning spent all my time writing
  a book which is at last finished and at the printers. (''Chinese Encounters''.)
  I don''t know if you are still working in Bed-Stuy with addicts, but if you are
  and if your question still holds I''ll try to answer it.<br>"The question was, what
  gives a work ''lasting'' importance; (plus another--''is being blessed with a writers
  creativity a blessing or a lonely life?'')<br>"The question is hard to answer mainly
  because there are so many different kinds of writing that have lasted. Shakespeare
  lasts, probably, because of the beauty of his language more than anything else,
  but a writer translated from another language, like Tolstoy, is forever new because
  of his stories and characters. A book like Robinson Crusoe, on the other hand, probably
  lasts so long because of the idea behind the story, one which reflects something
  we have all imagined at one time or another--being cut off from the whole world.
  A writer like Mark Twain probably lasts because of both his humor and the nostalgia
  his tales evoke in us for a simpler America.<br>"So I don''t know of any single
  reason that would explain them all. . . .<br>". . . [W]riting lasts when it conveys
  a clear and vivid impression of itself, while at the same time it is complex enough
  to bear re-reading and study. The clarity of the expression seems most important.
  In short, whatever it is, it is just that most sharply and clearly so that it imbeds
  itself in the readers'' minds.<br>"As for the writer''s life--the best of it is
  that you are independent of others, but it is a very lonely life and you have to
  be built for it to endure. It''s a life where nothing ever happens--nothing that
  really matters--except inside you, a life where very few times are you satisfied.
  But I wouldn''t trade it for any other."'
