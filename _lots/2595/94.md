FOOTNOTE: "\". . . I am very gratified to hear that you are giving a lecture-concert on my music at the Temple Isaiah Israel. . . . I remember with emotion the moving reception they gave me in November of last year, and I can see no better place where my music may be performed. I really hope that you can have a long-playing record of my Avodath-Hakodesh, Schelomo, Piano Quintet, because . . . the listeners would hear my own voice when I conducted them, and I hope that my music will, better than any words, bring to them my message of brotherhood and hopes for a better future. . . . Any true progress must first start in the individuals themselves, and in a change of heart. This is why spiritual values are more important than ever . . . .\""
