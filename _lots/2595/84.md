DESCRIPT: TROTSKY, LEON.
CROSSHEAD: Typed Letter Signed, "L. Trotsky," to publisher Charles Boni ("Dear esteemed
  Mr. Boni"), in German,
at-a-glance: Büyükada, 25 December 1930
TYPESET: complaining that the German edition of his <i>History of the Russian Revolution</i>
  is delayed [because Boni failed to send the manuscript to the German publisher],
  enclosing a copy of Trotsky's letter to the German publisher [not present], pointing
  out that the letter shows that the deadline for delivery of the second volume [of
  German edition] is fixed, and requesting that he send responses to Trotsky and the
  German publisher as soon as possible. 1 page, 4to; slight even toning overall, folds.
FOOTNOTE: '"My friend Max Eastman writes me about the postponement of the German edition
  of the first volume of the History of the Revolution. There is hardly anything to
  be done. I must politely remind you, that it was your publishing house which energetically
  insisted that I send the original text of my book to New York, despite the consequent
  inconveniences, chapter by chapter, so that, as stated in your letter, the house
  has the opportunity to translate the book chapter at a time and to place it in the
  American press. At the very last moment, I learned that nothing of the sort has
  happened. I can only regret this. Although my interests are thereby obviously encroached
  upon, to my regret, I cannot demand that Mr. Fischer sacrifice his interests for
  my sake. In any case, I have written to him about your proposition, and have enclosed
  a copy of my letter to the Fischer publishing house with this letter. <br>"From
  the copy you will gather than it contains an important question on fixing the deadline
  for delivery of the second volume. I request that you inform me and Mr. Fischer
  as soon as possible."<br>In 1931, Trotsky''s History of the Russian Revolution was
  published in German by Samuel von Fischer. The English version was published the
  same year--through a deal brokered by Charles Boni--as a series of six articles
  entitled The Russian Revolution in The Saturday Evening Post between April 25th
  and May 30th.'
