Each of the six prints in the set depicts a unique composition of flowers, from the elongated stems of lilies and gladiolas to an impressionistic rendering of a decaying hyacinth. The images are drawn on variously sized plates, enforcing the flowers’ arrangement and physical scale. Accompanied by a poem written by the American poet Henri Cole [...] The techniques used for the prints include line etch, drypoint, aquatint, and burnishing. Each print is a four-plate color etching comprised of a red, blue, yellow and black plate.\""
