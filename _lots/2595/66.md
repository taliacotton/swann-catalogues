DESCRIPT: "LAUGHTON, CHARLES."
CROSSHEAD: "Autograph Letter Signed, to \"Dear Gilbert,\""
at-a-glance: "Hollywood, [May 1932?]"
TYPESET: "expressing enthusiasm for the script [<i>Don Buonaparte</i>?], describing his acquaintance with a man like the character of Padre Pantaleone, suggesting Osbert Sitwell to provide an improved translation, remarking that James Whale has read and might direct the play, mentioning plays by Dumas and Eleanor Farjeon, hoping to begin with a London production in autumn, and complaining about life in Hollywood. 4 pages, 4to, written on four sheets; small hole at upper left, folds."
FOOTNOTE: "\"I think that the priest play is one of the most charming things I have read and, as you say, it would be a most welcome change for me (and I hope for audiences) to play someone 'good'.<br>\"As it happens I know very well just such a man as Padre Pantaleone who lives in the hills south of Naples at Ravello. We gave him money to support his miraculous effigy of Santo Cosmo and were showered with oranges, figs, local liqueurs and garlic cake till the day we left.<br>\"I think the construction of the play is perfection, but the translation is perhaps not all it might be. I have a hunch that the one person to translate the play, direct from what I surmise is the original Italian, is Osbert Sitwell. He . . . has an intimate knowledge of and love for these Italian vineyard people and his English is probably the prettiest written.<br>\"It would need, also, the most delicate direction. I took the liberty of persuading Jimmy Whale to read it. He shares my opinions and seemed quite inclined to want to direct it himself. . . . I cannot think of another director with the requisite sympathy for the necessary romantic colour, and can he design scenery (Americanism)?<br>\"I had already read the Dumas play. Ye-e-e-s but there is a better one written by Eleanor Farjeon . . . .<br>\"Are you considering as a possibility a London autumn production of Don Bonaparte with possibly a New York follow up if successful? . . .<br>\"I am not yet a Hollywood fan. No rehearsals, just banged in front of a camera, in a minute the scene is 'in the can', no redress. In the future I shall feel more sympathetic towards bad performances on the screen. Everybody is very nice but one feels that at any moment one might find oneself on the wrong side of the street door; however we are asked to Ben Schulberg's to dinner tomorrow night. Elsa is bored stiff and very restive to work.\""
