at-a-glance: Np, [12 November 1921?]; nd
TYPESET: The first, instructing him to change how he is to process a special set of
  12 blanks [likely blank disc records or phonograph cylinders] and explaining that
  these blanks can be used to evaluate "Scratch." The second, remarking that test
  results seemed to indicate a problem, inquiring whether the same mold was used [likely
  for making blanks], and requesting that [Frederick George] Blinne process the surface
  again. Together 3 pages, 8vo, ruled paper, written on three sheets; moderately toned
  overall, minor chipping to right edge, remnants of hinging at upper edges verso
  of first, folds.
FOOTNOTE: '12 November 1921?: "These are Dalley[?] blanks; Run . . . 12 blanks using
  the 1st set of polished Moulds from new polisher--<br>"Schedule should be 850 lbs.
  & not 1000 as on Reg[ular] blank--<br>"Keep the other 12 for further use. With these
  Dalley[?] blanks we can tell the dif[f]erence in Scratch--Print the whole 12 of
  1st lot."<br>Nd: "Something wrong on this test.<br>"All Blinne''s test[s] made over
  a period of 18 months shows 6 coats better than 4 coats.<br>"Were these made with
  the same working mould.<br>"You know that first playing once over is much louder
  surface than the next playing over. Have Blinne play them over again."'
