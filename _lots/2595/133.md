FOOTNOTE: "21 February 1952, to Maurice, in English: \". . . I hope we'll see you in New York in a week, as you had said. . . . I started again to paint quietly, every day, the whole time. The exhibition, I think, is not without any success, some people are strongly interested. The[re] were articles in several newspapers, the most violently against. It does not matter at all. One must expect, when he proposes a change in any field, there will not go without outcries and fury. . . .\"<br>18 October [1954], to \"My very dear Maury,\" in English: \". . . Did you hear that Mr. Zadok bought also several pictures of mine . . . ?<br>\"There will be a big show of my pictures, done from 1942 to 1954, in Paris, at the Cercle Volney, from March 15th to April 15th.<br>\"These days I am busy with lithographs, and small pictures with gouache. . . .\"<br>26 October 1955, to the Culbergs' daughter Franka, writing from Vence: \". . . I do not feel perfectly at ease . . ., but a little like an exile in a foreign land. . . . However, I have good working conditions here: very good light, several workshops (I'm getting ready to build new ones). I'm working a lot, endlessly. . . . The very strong friendship that tied me to [her father, Maurice] leads me to feel tied to you by family and I feel a bit like your brother, or your uncle. What a precious good it would be for me if he were now alive! But, well, he is dead. He remains a brilliant star in the sky of my life. . . .\"<br>18 December 1966, to \"good little Frankie\": \"I've been extremely busy for two months with my paintings; and the work site for my Chinese ink 'collections' (in the little studio that is reserved for them and which your mother knows) is a bit abandoned. . . .\"<br>7 January 1956, to Mrs. Ruth Culberg: \". . . My painting still occupies me a great deal constantly. The new buildings I had constructed in Vence, and which comprise several very bright large studios, now provide me with places there [that are] well adapted to my needs and where I am very happy. . . .\"<br>11 October 1957, to \"Dear friend Ruth,\" in English: \". . . In July we drived [sic] to Switzerland and Germany . . . but it was very bad for Lili, she was very tired and nervous; I see she cannot make such trips, it is too tiring for her . . . . I was very pleased with the exhibition of Leverkusen, I met there several people very enthusiastic, and important and interessant [sic] articles in newspapers. . . .\"<br>1 August 1958, to \"My dear little Franka\": \". . . I am very busy [in Vence], because I work a lot. I suffer a bit from the heat that is raging these weeks and does no good for my business . . . .\"<br>29 March 1959, to \"Dear friend Franka\": \". . . An exposition of my paintings should open in Paris, at the Daniel Cordier Gallery, April 28th. This exposition is titled, 'Celebration of the soil.' It will include some very difficult canvases with a particular spirit, some called, 'Topographies,' others, 'Texturologies.' They are very austere paintings in which no people at all appear.<br>\"Daniel Cordier is now (since two years) my art dealer in Paris. He is a very educated and cultivated man, very intelligent and knowing painting extremely well. . . . He's in New York right now. . . . He hopes that he will find there some possibilities for purchasing my paintings. . . . He asked me to give him a few addresses of people who own my paintings and who would be likely, either to sell some to him, or to give him information to help him find others that he might eventually buy. This is why I've given him your address. . . .<br>\"These last months I've been very busy making a very large series of lithographs (several hundred); that has led me to establish veritable print shops in Paris and Vence; I employ two workers. Because of this, I haven't made many paintings, but I have nevertheless made a few.\"<br>31 January 1979, to \"Dear Franka,\" in English: \". . . I keep a very nice remember [sic] of our meeting . . . And I also very often think of your dear father. I keep a great affection for his memory. His meeting is amongst the most important events of my life. . . .\"<br>2 December 1982, to \"Dear Franka\": \". . . Regarding the eventual monument in Chicago . . . . Pace Gallery (with which I have an exclusive agreement for the U.S.A.) has right now in New York some large painted sculptures (3 and 4 meters high). It is possible to build, on order, more important monuments. But I'm afraid that it would be inopportune to suggest, at least for the time being, a second monument in Chicago. . . .\"<br><b>With</b>--Small group of ephemera and letters to Franka Culberg from museums, galleries, and others relating to her art collection, including manuscript notes in unknown hand, a purchase agreement, a telegram, etc. 1956-86.<br>Provenance: Ruth Culberg; thence by descent to Franka Culberg Vlack; thence by descent to the present owner."
