pullquote: 'Role Of Gigi In The Film: "A Younger Person Than I Should Play It"'
DESCRIPT: HEPBURN, AUDREY.
CROSSHEAD: Autograph Letter Signed, "Audrey," to Gigi playwright Anita Loos ("Darling
  Anita"), in green ink,
at-a-glance: Paris, 30 December 1955
TYPESET: thanking for the gift of a date book and asking if Sarah Bernhardt is depicted
  on the cover, apologizing about the delayed answer to her letter about <i>Gigi</i>,
  explaining that she and Kurt [Frings, her agent] fought [with Paramount to convince
  them to purchase film rights to the play for Hepburn] but that MGM ended up buying
  [the rights] for Leslie [Caron], and confessing that, although she loved the play,
  someone younger than herself should perform the role. Last line and signature written
  vertically in right margin of terminal page. 4 pages, small 8vo, hotel "Raphael"
  stationery, written on two sheets; horizontal fold.
FOOTNOTE: '"First thank you so much for sending me such a lovely date book with I
  do believe Sarah Bernhard[t] on the cover! (am I right). You are dear to spoil me
  and I love my gift.<br>"I am sorry I did not answer your long letter, about Gigi,
  to me before. The reason was that things were really popping at the time, and I
  wanted to write when I knew more. Well I am afraid it is not to be. No one could
  have put up a stiffer fight than Kurt and I did over this last year and over this
  last month. Paramount first never bought it because of the censor problem. Nevertheless
  I have continuously mentioned the property. Metro have now bought it since it is
  solved from the censorship point of view. They naturally bought it for Leslie (who
  would be perfect for it) and it being her studio she has the right to it. Metro
  were willing to have me do it but no deal was worked out between them and Paramount
  which I possibly could make, as you know. In these situations the actor is the one
  who gives everything in order to play a part he or she wants.<br>"I am sorry as
  I loved the play. I now console myself that maybe I have grown up too much and a
  younger person than I should play it. I certainly hope they will produce it with
  all the love and care it deserves.<br>"We had a divine Xmas, hope yours too was
  as happy, lots of love and kisses."'
