DESCRIPT: JUNG, CARL GUSTAV.
CROSSHEAD: Autograph Letter Signed, "Dr. Jung," to French-American psychoanalyst André
  Tridon, in English, in ink and pencil,
at-a-glance: Küsnacht, 5 September 1919
TYPESET: giving page numbers [in pencil] in <i>Collected Papers</i> where one can
  read his critique of the viewpoint held by Freud and Adler, remarking that he is
  finishing a work on types of attitude [<i>Psychological Types</i> (1921)], explaining
  that his critique applies to much of the work done in America and Europe, and noting
  that his own theory has been adopted by [Herbert] Silberer. 1½ pages, 8vo, "Dr.
  med. C.G. Jung LL.D" stationery, written on recto and verso of a single sheet, few
  tiny scattered holes repaired with tissue (minor loss to text), horizontal folds,
  encapsuled (but removable). With the address panel from the original envelope.
FOOTNOTE: '"You [can] find my views concerning Freud''s and Adler''s School expressed
  in my Collected Papers . . . .<br>"I am about to finish a book about the problem
  of attitude and the types of attitude. . . .<br>"I consider the work actually done
  in America as well as in Europe along the lines mentioned above, as based upon too
  narrow an hypothesis. The neurotic problem cannot be solved through reduction to
  sexuality. It only suits a certain kind of mentality. It is a striking argument
  against the Sex-hypothesis, that Freud''s first pupil, Adler had to invent an absolutely
  different theory, that suits many people much better than Freud''s view, as the
  effect shows.<br>"I try to reconcile the contradictory views through a theory of
  attitude and a different appreciation of symbolism. The latter viewpoint has been
  taken up by Silberer too, as you know."'
