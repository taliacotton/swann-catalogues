TYPESET: "12 tipped-in color plates by Rackham with lettered tissue guards; numerous black-and-white and silhouette illustrations throughout the text. Large 4to, publisher's gilt-pictorial vellum, boards slightly bowed per usual, scatttered discoloration including some mottling to board edges; ties lacking; top edges trimmed and gilt, others uncut; endpapers with occasional foxing. <i>Number 10 of only 100 copies of the American edition signed by Rackham.</i> \"He [Rackham] is not usually remembered as an illustrator of Dickens, but A Christmas Carol (1915) was decidedly successful, for he contrived to adapt the tradition of 'Phiz' and Cruikshank to his own characteristic style in the pictures of Victorian London and at the same time found scope for his fantasy in the ghost scenes. We also find him here developing his special talent for silhouette, rare among illustrators\"--Derek Hudson. Arthur Rackham, page 106. Latimore and Haskell, pp. 44-45. Riall, pp. 124-125."
