FOOTNOTE: "\". . . I was very interested to hear that you would like to have your Sunday School children see THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. I really made the picture for young people. In their hands will lie decisions for good and evil of a magnitude that no other generation has ever been called upon to make. Only if these decisions are based upon the eternal principles of morality--written once upon tablets of stone, and embedded by our Founding Fathers into the American way of life--can freedom under God, as we know it in our land, survive in the world. . . .\""
