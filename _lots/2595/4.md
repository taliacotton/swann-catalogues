FOOTNOTE: '"Fort Crawford," 23 August 1832: ". . . Experience has proved that the
  oftener troops are moved even from one station to another the more efficient they
  are, as it has the effect in a great measure of preventing that accumulation of
  large quantities of baggage . . . when they are permitted to remain for several
  years at the same station, particularly if it is a frontier one. Frequent movements
  . . . along the upper Mississippi and the rivers emptying into it through the Indian
  Country, would not only have the effect of making them respect, but fear us & as
  a matter of course, would be the means of keeping them quiet. Such movements not
  only invigorate the officers & men, but at the same time would serve to instruct
  the former in the important duties of moving & encamping troops; in what ought to
  be considered an enemy''s country. . . .<br>"I should not have hesitated on my arrival
  here from the campaign, in relieving one of the companies at Fort Snelling with
  one from this post . . . had not Gen''l Atkinson, who was present at the time, advised
  or directed me not to do so until I referred the matter to the Gen''l-in-Chief .
  . . . In the present state of affairs, should the Indians in the vicinity of Forts
  Snelling & Armstrong become at any time dissatisfied & threaten hostilities toward
  the whites, I would not feel myself authorized to reinforce either of those garrisons
  . . . without an order to that effect from higher authority, let the emergency be
  what it might. . . ."<br>"Fort Frank Brooke," 21 December 1838: ". . . I found at
  Fort Fanning two companies of the 2nd Inf''y which had reached that place a few
  days before from the North and having learned on my arrival that the Indians had
  stopped a train of four wagons belonging to citizens near Waccasassa and robbed
  the drivers (Negroes) of their clothing and wagon covers, . . . I determined to
  proceed to this place with the Infantry and Dragoons . . . and have the country
  between the Suwannee and Tallahassee completely scoured and the enemy driven from
  it before I left it . . . . Several reconnoitering parties had been sent out by
  Major Noel . . . one of whom fell in with and captured an Indian, who afterward
  however made his escape. Many recent signs of them were found indicating that they
  were in considerable force . . . . [I]t is hoped that the enemy will be driven from
  Middle Florida, and entire security given to the inhabitants in a very short time.
  . . .<br>". . . Col. Twiggs reports that some outbuildings within three miles of
  Black Creek were burnt by the hostiles (where there were from three to four hundred
  troops) who also fired on the house, in which was a woman and six or seven children
  . . . . The Indians, if Indians they were, ran off; he also states that a cart accompanied
  by two men was robbed by the hostiles . . . and a man was fired at and shot through
  the arm between Fort Heilman and Jacksonville--all of which from reports appears
  to have been committed by a few Indians and one Negro. . . . I am constantly informed
  of murders committed on our citizens, house burned and other depredations on their
  property, in situations where they are ten times more numerous than the enemy who
  they say committed them. I shall however do all in my power to give protection to
  the inhabitants even should I be compelled to abandon a part of my original plan
  of campaign."'
