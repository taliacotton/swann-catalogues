at-a-glance: "Morganton, NC, 29 October 1982"
TYPESET: "summarizing the crimes of President Nixon relating to the Watergate affair and remarking that much of the evidence is to be found in Nixon's own secret recordings. 1 page, 4to, personal stationery; horizontal folds."
FOOTNOTE: "\". . . Any claim that President Nixon was not involved in wrong-doing in the Watergate affair is shown to be false by the words imprinted by his own voice on his own secret tapes.<br>\"Tapes made by him and Haldeman six days after the burglarers [sic] were caught in the Watergate reveal that on June 23, 1972, he and Haldeman both knew that the break-in was an enterprise of the committee which he set up to promote his reelection; that the break-in had been financed by his campaign funds; that the FBI was about to discover the source of the particular funds which were used to finance the burglary; and that Nixon and Haldeman on that day conspired to induce the CIA to persuade the FBI to stop its investigation as to the source of the funds.<br>\"The words on tapes . . . show that at all times President Nixon aided and abetted his aides in hiding the truth about Watergate from the American people, the courts, and congressional committees, and that at no time did he ever make any honest effort to have the truth about Watergate revealed. . . . [T]he ten Republican Congressmen who had voted [a]gainst his impeachment to the last stated that these tapes showed he was guilty of obstructing justice . . . [T]hey said it had been claimed in the past and would undoubtedly be claimed in the future that Nixon was driven from office by political enemies and a hostile press. They stated that this was not true, but on the contrary, Nixon's misfortune was self-inflicted . . . .\""
