DESCRIPT: BALFOUR, ARTHUR JAMES.
CROSSHEAD: 'Two items, each Signed: Photograph * Typed Letter.'
at-a-glance: Np, nd; [London], 16 December 1918
TYPESET: The photograph, a postcard showing bust portrait of him. Signed in the blank
  lower margin. Correspondence side blank. 5½x3½ inches. The letter, to "Dr Carl[?]
  Alexander," claiming that there is little justification for suspecting that Great
  Britain would expand maritime power in a way that is contrary to the interests of
  the League of Nations, and suggesting that those who harbor suspicions are jealous
  of British power. 1 page, small 4to, personal stationery; short closed separation
  at horizontal fold.
FOOTNOTE: '". . . I presume that those who wish to curtail the maritime power of Great
  Britain do so on the ground that she may use that power not as a mandatory of the
  League of Nations, but for selfish ends. Historically, there seems little justification
  for the suspicion; and you and I know that it is without foundation. But our supremacy
  at sea, which this war has forced upon the attention of all mankind, naturally excites
  some jealousy."'
