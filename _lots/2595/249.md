CROSSHEAD: "Flatland."
at-a-glance: "San Francisco: Arion Press, 1980"
TYPESET: "Text by Edwin A. Abbott. 14 line drawings and 10 diecuts by Andrew Hoyem. Introduction by Ray Bradbury. Initials by Gill Shadow. Tall 8vo, 56 accordion-folded pages in an aluminum binding that sits in a metal frame with latch at top. <i>Number 241 of 275 signed by Bradbury and Hoyem.</i> One of the most unusual books printed by the press. The color and grey background that appear on some plates were applied by hand; some diagrams were photo-engraved, the letterpress printing and die cutting were executed on a hand-fed press, and the binding was crafted from aluminum by Q-Rolo Sheet Metal Products. The whole can be opened to a form 30-foot plane (like the plane-geometrical citizens of Flatland)."
