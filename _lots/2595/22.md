FOOTNOTE: '"You see I have not forgotten the compact made in the stall of old W.C.
  several months ago though you perhaps have forgotten the very existence of me, Theodosia
  Goodman. . . .<br>"Tomorrow we both take the leap out of our ''teens'' together.
  ''Misery doth love company,'' & it certainly is a sort of grim satisfaction to feel
  that somebody is growing old with you. Accept my heartiest congratulations dear
  Gertie . . . .<br>"If you really are engaged Gertie, . . . there is really nothing
  left for me to wish you on your natal day, for you surely have all the happiness
  that is allotted to one person. I can add though that I wish you a continuation
  of this happiness through your sister''s life''s course.<br>". . . I would like
  you to give me one little thought tomorrow when I should so love to be in my own
  house with all my friends."<br>For a short period beginning in 1905, Bara lived
  at 168 Harvard Street in Rochester, NY.'
