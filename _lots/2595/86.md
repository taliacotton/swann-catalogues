DESCRIPT: WELLINGTON, ARTHUR WELLESLEY; DUKE OF.
CROSSHEAD: Autograph Letter Signed, "Wellington,"
at-a-glance: London, 11 March 1824
TYPESET: to "My dear Sir," expressing regret upon hearing of the death of Colonel
  Colebrooke, and responding to a request to assist in securing, for an unnamed person,
  the position of successor to Sir Edward Paget. 7 pages, small 8vo, written on two
  folded sheets.
FOOTNOTE: '". . . I believe it is true that in two or three years Sir Edward Paget
  will return from India, and I have already had no less than three applications that
  I will use my influence to have a successor appointed to him. . . . I cannot press
  the views of Sir Henry[?] Campbell, for instance, upon this situation of Commander-in-Chief
  in succession to Sir Edward Paget, without adverting to the views of others. . .
  . In short, without being the disposer of the patronage of the government, I am
  obliged to weigh the claims of different individuals to its favour. . . ."'
