at-a-glance: "Graz, 24 January 1873"
TYPESET: "reporting that he has received and returned the [corrected] manuscript of his short story, \"Wedding in the Ice Palace,\" expressing pleasure that the story was accepted, showing admiration for the magazine, hoping that it would accept his story, \"The Aesthetics of Ugliness\" [\"Die Ästhetik des Hässlichen,\" 1874], granting permission to make editorial changes, and, in a postscript: \"The exorcism in 'Die Ästhetik des Hässlichen' is based on actual events. The man--Father Gaßner--is today a professor of theology in Salzburg and the author of a book on exorcism, the publication of which has had . . . only a comic effect.\" 3½ pages, 8vo, written on a folded sheet; faint scattered foxing, folds, docketing on terminal page in unknown hand."
FOOTNOTE: "\"By receiving the proofs of my short story, 'Die Hochzeit im Eispalast,' which I return to you under cover, I see that you have also accepted the story, which makes me particularly happy, because there is no magazine in Germany that I appreciate as much as the 'Monatshefte.' My admiration is also explained by your having helped begin my career as a Latin writer with my 'Don Juan von Colomair.'<br>\"I should be very lucky if my longer work, 'Die Ästhetik des Hässlichen,' which I sent you some time ago, should be appreciated by you and, consequently, would be published in the 'Monatshefte.' If you should be shocked here and there by details in the manuscripts that I send you, I give you once and for all and without reservation the right to make changes, because with a censor like you, knowing your good taste, I have everything to gain.\"<br>Sacher-Masoch's story, Die Hochzeit im Eispalast: Eine russische Hofgeschichte, was published in the April 1873 issue of Westermann's Illustrierte Deutsche Monatshefte."
