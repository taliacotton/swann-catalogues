FOOTNOTE: "\"'. . . the ocean much better than land carriage, on seeing a man driving a wagon in the street, expressed his surprise at his being able to drive so straight without the assistance of a rudder.' A sleigh is never seen, at least it's a great novelty, on the Cape, the snow being either absorbed by the sand or blown into drifts. Yet we counted half a dozen 3 large meeting houses and 4 school houses nearly as large on this street, though some of these had a tight board fence about them to preserve the plot within level and hard. These fences even within a foot of many of these houses gave the town a less cheerful & hospitable appearance. They told us that on the whole, the sand had made no progress for the last ten years. The cows are no longer permitted to go at large, and every means is taken to stop the sandy tide.<br>\"The Harbor of Provincetown, which, as well as the greater part of the Bay, and an indefinite expanse of ocean, we overlooked from our perch, is deservedly famous.\""
