FOOTNOTE: "\"Poor Seabon! I do feel most awfully sad for him. But sadder still on your account. Well, and how does it go?--as if it could go any way but one. And what about Seaby--where is he deposited? There is really nothing I can do; I am having back-tax trouble--which is one reason I'm living in Switzerland; and it will be another year before my new book is finished; however, I will try to send S. a Christmas check. But then I must send one to Joe, too--who is, as usual, in the direst straits. . . .<br>\"I was delighted over the elections--the Kennedys are old and great friends; I stayed with them last winter in Palm Beach, and love them both. I think he will make a wonderful President, and Jackie is a brilliant, angelic girl.<br>\"Verbier is a small winter resort high in the Alps and deep in snow. Jack loves skiing; I don't, particularly, but it is a wonderful climate, very dry and snowy and sunny, and it is a quiet place, a good place to work. Also, I have several friends--living not too far away: Charlie and Oona Chaplin, and Noel Coward all live with[in] an hour's drive.<br>\"They have almost finished the movie of 'Breakfast at Tiffany's,' and I'm told it is very good, and that Audrey Hepburn is excellent.<br>\"Have all the animals here: the cat, Bunky and Kelly. What a chore it is lugging them all over Europe! Dear Kelly is pretty old now, and blind. . . .\""
