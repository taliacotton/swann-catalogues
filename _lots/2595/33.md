FOOTNOTE: "\"I was . . . so tremendously glad you liked 'In Which We Serve.' It was hard work at the time but I must say I feel the result was worth it--chiefly because the Navy themselves have found it good & that, to me, is of supreme importance.<br>\"At the moment I am . . . more than half way through a long provincial tan. This is my 20th week & we have eight more to go. I am doing a repertory of 3 plays & am also doing troop, hospital & factory concerts in all the various towns. Pretty strenuous but interesting & the awakening interest in the theatre all over England is really exciting.<br>\". . . [O]wing I suppose to the uncanny way I attract air-raids, we had a real lively smasher on my first night at home & all my hot-water system was knocked for six. . . .<br>\"I am glad you are all working away for The Cause.<br>\"I must say things seem to be looking better now-a days, thank God. . . .\""
