TYPESET: "Lithograph, 1937.  220x302 mm; 8⅝x11⅞ inches, full margins.  Signed and titled in pencil, lower margin.  Published by the Federal Art Project, Work Projects Administration, New York, with the ink stamp, lower left.  A very good impression of this extremely scarce lithograph. <br><br>We have not found another impression at auction in the past 30 years.  Cole 50.<br><br>Soyer was born in Russia and immigrated to New York at the age of twelve. He studied at Cooper Union, the National Academy of Design and with Guy Pène du Bois (1884-1958) at the Art Students League. He is known as a Social Realist, depicting the daily struggles of those living in New York City.  His chosen subject matter became especially poignant at the onset of the Great Depression, and, after he began to exhibit his work in the late 1920s, he cemented his reputation among the top American realist artists of the 20th century."
