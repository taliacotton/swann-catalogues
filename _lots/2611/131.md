  auction in the past 30 years.<br><br>Lewis (1881-1962) had met Edward Hopper approximately
  15 years after his arrival in the United States in 1900.  The two artists shared
  discontent over their commercial careers.  In 1927, Lewis was given a solo exhibition
  at Kennedy & Company in New York and successive shows at the gallery were so well
  received that Lewis, like Hopper after his own first taste of success, stopped commercial
  work after 1929.  <br><br>Lewis's career was built upon his technical virtuosity
  in printmaking.  Lewis's first interest in printmaking has been tied to his work
  for the Sydney newspaper Bulletin in the 1890s.   While in Australia, he was exposed
  to works of several important etchers, including Australian artist Arthur Streeton,
  as well as Seymour Haden (Whistler's brother-in-law), Rembrandt, Charles Meryon,
  and James A. M. Whistler, but there was no known attempt to etch before Lewis reached
  the United States.  Lewis's first documented print, Smoke Pillar, Weehawken, printed
  in 1915, (see McCarron 1) has enough technical skill to argue that this was not
  the artist's first attempt (he was known to have destroyed unsatisfactory impressions).  The
  same year, Lewis encouraged Hopper to take up printmaking and gave him technical
  advice.  After this exchange, Hopper created his own etching Paris Street Scene
  with Carriage, 1915-18 (see Levin 6).  While Lewis would employ aquatint and other
  processes in conjunction with etching, Hopper continued to work with only etching
  and drypoint.  Nevertheless, the two artists would use largely the same subject
  matter and compositional elements, like cutting angles and the interplay between
  light and shadow.  McCarron 69.
