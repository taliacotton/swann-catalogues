Born in Columbus, Ohio he worked as a commercial illustrator as a student at The Ohio State University from 1901-04.  After Ohio State, he moved to New York where he studied with Robert Henri and soon became associated with the Aschan artists. He depicted scenes of everyday life in New York that were rooted in realism. He started making lithographs in 1916 and revived interest in the medium as at the time etching was the preferred printmaking method.
