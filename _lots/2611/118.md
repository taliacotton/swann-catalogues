TYPESET: "<p>Watercolor, gouache and crayon on paper, circa 1920.  280x204 mm; 11x8
  inches. Signed in crayon, lower right recto.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection,
  Florida.<br><br>The World Service of the American Express Company was an employee
  magazine published in London from June 1920 to September 1921. Marin (1870-1953)
  may have been invited to provide a cover design for the magazine (though there is
  no published edition of the magazine with this cover by Marin), through his connection
  with Alfred Stieglitz or another media contact in New York, though Marin rarely
  worked in commercial illustration. Other artists who contributed to the short-lived
  World Service of the American Express Company magazine include the prolific Hungarian
  illustrator Willy Pogany (1882-1955) and the American graphic designer William T.
  Sniffin, who was a lead designer at American Type Founders, New Jersey, from 1927-33.</p>"
