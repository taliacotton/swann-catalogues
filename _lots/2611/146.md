TYPESET: "Lithograph, 1926.  359x428 mm; 14⅛x16⅞ inches, wide margins.  Edition of 60.  Signed and dated in pencil, lower margin.  Printed by George Miller, New York.  A very good impression.  Winnan 26.<br><br>Gág's (1893-1946) first solo exhibition was held in 1926 at the Weyhe Gallery in New York.  Like Edward Hopper, Gág's works reveal a disenchantment of the \"American Dream\" between the two world wars and seem to capture a moment in time, giving life to inanimate objects when there are no humans present.  Coming to New York to attend the Art Students League on a scholarship in 1917, Gág began to explore the city's less aesthetic scenes, such as the subway stations, further encouraged by her classes with John Sloan."
