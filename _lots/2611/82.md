TYPESET: "Etching and drypoint, 1913.  330x265 mm; 13x10Â½ inches, full margins.  Second state (of 2).  Edition of approximately only 10.  Signed in pencil, lower right.  Published by Alfred Stieglitz, 291 Fifth Avenue, New York.  A superb, richly-inked impression of this extremely scarce etching.<br><br>Soon after he arrived in New York in 1911, following a six year sojourn in Europe, mainly Paris, where he had sharpened his skill as a printmaker under the influence of masters such as James A. M. Whistler and Charles Meryon, Marin (1870-1953) made a conscious shift in style, from what can loosely be described as a more traditional Neo-Impressionist model to a novel, expressive, modern form of abstraction.  He attributed this transition to the city itself, and recalled of New York, \"Shall we consider the life of a great city as confined simply to the people and animals on the streets and in its buildings?  Are the buildings themselves dead?  We have been told somewhere that a work of art is a thing alive.  You cannot create a work of art unless the things you behold respond to something within you.  Therefore if these buildings move me, they too must have life.  Thus the whole city is alive; buildings, people all are alive; and the more they move me the more I feel them to be alive.<br><br>It is this moving of me that I try to express, so that I may recall the spell I have been under and behold the expression of the different emotions that have been called into being.  How am I to express what I feel, so that its expression will bring me back under the spells?  Shall I copy facts photographically?<br><br>I see great forces at work; great movements; the large buildings and the small buildings; the warring of the great and the small; influences of one mass on another greater or smaller mass.  Feelings are aroused which give me the desire to express the reaction of these 'pull forces'; those influences which play with one another; great masses pulling smaller masses, each subject to some degree to the other's power,\" (the artist's introduction to his exhibition of watercolors at 291, Stieglitz's New York gallery, in 1913).
