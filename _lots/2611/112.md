TYPESET: "Lithograph, circa 1928.  180x220 mm; 7¼x8½ inches, full margins.  Edition unknown but presumably very small.  Signed and titled in pencil, lower margin.  Printed by Jacob Friedland, New York.  A very good impression of this extremely scarce, unrecorded lithograph.<br><br>Soyer was born in Russia and immigrated to New York at the age of twelve. He studied at Cooper Union, the National Academy of Design and with Guy Pène du Bois (1884-1958) at the Art Students League. He is known as a Social Realist, depicting the daily struggles of those living in New York City.  His chosen subject matter became especially poignant at the onset of the Great Depression, and, after he began to exhibit his work in the late 1920s, he cemented his reputation among the top American realist artists of the 20th century."
