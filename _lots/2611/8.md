Sanborn, Nyack; Alexander Gallery, New York; Kennedy Galleries, Inc., New York, with the label; private collection, Pennsylvania.<br><br>Hopper (1882-1967) made numerous similar ship studies, very early on as an aspiring young artist, before his training as an illustrator.  Many of these early nautical drawings are now in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (Josephine N. Hopper Bequest).  As a student (he graduated from Nyack High School in 1899), Hopper dreamed of being a naval architect, and this desire is evidenced by the numerous nautical drawings he made during these years."
