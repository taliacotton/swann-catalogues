  recalling his early artistic pursuit, Hopper noted, "In every artist''s development
  the germ of the later work is always found in the earlier.  The nucleus around which
  the artist''s intellect builds his work is himself; the central ego, personality,
  or whatever it may be called, and this changes little from birth to death.  What
  he was once, he always is, with slight modification.  Changing fashions in methods
  or subject matter alter him little or not at all," (Levin, Edward Hopper as Illustrator,
  New York, 1979, page 1).'
