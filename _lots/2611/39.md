DESCRIPT: JOHN SLOAN
CROSSHEAD: Turning Out the Light.
TYPESET: Etching, 1905. 127x178 mm; 5x7 inches, full margins. Edition of 110 (from
  an intended edition of 100). Signed, titled and inscribed "100 proofs" in pencil,
  lower margin.  From New York City Life.  A superb, richly-inked impression with
  very strong contrasts.  <br><br>Sloan (1871-1951) produced his New York City Life
  series of ten etchings from 1905-06, recording the lives of the city's tenement
  dwellers.  Sloan found these prints difficult to market to buyers, as they were
  not accustomed to seeing such honest depictions of everyday life.  The current etching
  was one of the works rejected from an American Watercolor Society exhibition in
  1906 for indecency.<br><br>According to Levin, "Hopper may have first met John Sloan
  as early as April 1904, just after Sloan's move to New York where he lived in the
  same building as Robert Henri, but certainly by 1906 when Sloan substituted for
  Henri for one month at the New York School of Art.  For Hopper, Sloan represented
  one artist he could respect who prior to 1916 had worked regularly as a commercial
  illustrator.  Sloan's influence is particularly visible during Hopper's formative
  years," (Levin, Edward Hopper as Illustrator, New York, 1979, page 9).  Morse 134.
