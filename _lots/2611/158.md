  <br><br>Provenance: Margaret V. and Samuel A. Lewisohn, New York; thence by descent
  to current owner, private collection, New York.<br><br>Demuth (1883-1935) was born
  in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and suffered an injury as a child that forced him to
  walk with a cane.  As he was unable to be as physically active as other children,
  his mother gave him crayons to draw with.  His parents supported his art from a
  young age and he attended Franklin and Marshall College, Drexel University and the
  Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia.  After leaving school, he focused
  on his preferred medium of watercolor and found inspiration in flowers and plants
  in his mother''s garden, a subject that would preoccupy him throughout his life.<br><br>Demuth
  made his studio at his home in Lancaster, but traveled frequently and made many
  important friends in the artistic community.  He traveled three times to Paris where
  he studied at the Académie Colarossi and Académie Julian, joined the avant-garde
  artistic scene, and admired the work of European modernists, even spending time
  at Gertrude Stein''s salon.  He met Marsden Hartley while in Paris who later introduced
  him to Alfred Stieglitz and became part of his tightknit group of artists.<br><br>While
  well-traveled, most of his work was created in his studio in Lancaster.  Demuth
  eventually embraced a Precisionist style, focusing on geometric forms and industrial
  subject matter.  He also returned to flowers, plants and vegetables consistently
  throughout his career, focusing with technical virtuosity and deft handling on their
  color and form.'
