A very good impression.<br><br>Freeman (1908-1978), known for his later work as a children's book illustrator, was an active chronicler of city life during the 1930s and 1940s.  His images of New York, lacking the emotional tension of the American Scene artists, are like that of his instructor, John Sloan, in documenting the everyday lives of New Yorkers.  He was born in San Diego and after attending a summer course at the San Diego School of Fine Arts, he moved to New York to become an artist.  He studied at the Art Students League spent much of his time backstage at theater productions sketching from life.    McCulloch 97."
