TYPESET: "Lithograph, 1940-41.  247x323 mm; 9¾x12⅞ inches, full margins.  The posthumous edition of 13 printed for the family of the artist (aside from the lifetime edition of 12), with the artist's ink stamp lower left.  Printed by George Miller, New York.  A very good impression.  <br><br>This lithograph was drawn from a study for an earlier same-titled etching (see Winnan 71).  Winnan 117.<br><br>Gág's (1893-1946) first solo exhibition was held in 1926 at the Weyhe Gallery in New York.  Like Hopper, Gág's works reveal a disenchantment of the \"American Dream\" between the two world wars and seem to capture a moment in time, giving life to inanimate objects when there are no humans present.  Coming to New York to attend the Art Students League on a scholarship in 1917, Gág began to explore the city's less than aesthetic scenes, such as the subway stations, further encouraged by her classes with John Sloan."
