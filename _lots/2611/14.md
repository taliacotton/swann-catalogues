  by Hopper (1882-1967), though more loosely drawn and less finished than the current
  work, in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art (Josephine N. Hopper
  Bequest).  From this very early treatment of the subject, at just 16 years old,
  only a year before he began art studies with a correspondence course in 1899 and
  soon after transferred to the New York School of Art and Design (the forerunner
  of Parsons The New School for Design), Hopper frequently returned to the theme of
  aloneness (and loneliness) in many of his most iconic works, including the oil paintings
  Automat, 1927, Morning Sun, 1952, and Office in a Small City, 1953, as well as the
  etching Night Shadows, 1921.<br><br>According to Levin, "Hopper brought to his art
  and to illustration a cool detachment reflecting the reserve with which he dealt
  with the world around him.  His personality, especially his shyness, did not lend
  itself to illustrating fiction that was either overly sentimental or involved with
  fantasy.  Hopper preferred to depict what he observed in the most matter-of-fact
  manner.  When he had to illustrate to earn a living, he found greater freedom in
  the illustration of nonfiction topics, particularly for trade publications," (Levin,
  Edward Hopper as Illustrator, New York, 1979, page 5).'
