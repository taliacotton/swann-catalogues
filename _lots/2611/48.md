TYPESET: "Charcoal on cream laid paper, circa 1900-05. 625x447 mm; 24¾x17¾ inches.<br><br>Provenance: Estate of the artist, New York; Josephine N. Hopper, the artist's widow, New York; Reverend and Mrs. Arthayer R. Sanborn, Nyack; Alexander Gallery, New York; Kennedy Galleries, Inc., New York, with the label; private collection,, New York; private collection, Pennsylvania.<br><br>Exhibited: Kennedy Galleries, Inc., New York, 2005.<br><br>The current drawing appears to relate to other life studies by Hopper (1882-1967), many of which are academic nudes, also in charcoal and on similar sheets of drawing paper, made while he was studying at the New York School of Art and Design, the forerunner of Parsons The New School for Design, with William Merritt Chase (1849-1916) and Robert Henri (1865-1929), the latter of whom taught life drawing and stressed originality to his students.  There are nearly fifty such academic studies, both male and female nudes, many also with added marginal \"doodles\" like the current drawing, now in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art (Josephine N. Hopper Bequest).  The current drawing of a man in a suit is drawn over another quickly, more lightly-sketched figure of a woman in a dress.  The initials \"R.F.\" upper right recto might refer to the name of the sitter."
