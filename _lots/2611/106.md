Signed in pencil,  and signed and inscribed \"imp\" by the printer, Bolton Brown, in pencil, lower margin.  A very good impression of this scare lithograph.<br><br>Bellows (1882-1925) was part of the second generation of Aschan School artists. Born in Columbus, Ohio he worked as a commercial illustrator as a student at The Ohio State University from 1901-04.  After Ohio State, he moved to New York where he studied with Robert Henri and soon became associated with the Aschan artists. He depicted scenes of everyday life in New York that were rooted in realism. He started making lithographs in 1916 and revived interest in the medium as at the time etching was the preferred printmaking method. Lithography gave him a steady stream of income to provide for his family and also grew his popularity as an artist.<br><br>The New York Times described this lithograph in its May 1, 1921 review as a \"Subject interpreted in the spirit of Dickens.  With a hint of melodrama, a hint of comedy, and a pinch of realism.\"  Mason 89."
