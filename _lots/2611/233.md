TYPESET: "Lithograph, 1933.  265x412 mm; 10½x16¼ inches, full margins.  Edition of 25.  Signed in pencil, lower right.  A superb, luminous impression of this very scarce lithograph.  Stuckey 38.<br><br>Wengenroth (1906-1978) was born into a creative family in Brooklyn and studied at the Art Students League, New York with George Bridgman and at the Grand Central School of Art with Wyman Adams.  It was not until 1929 that he started working in lithography with George Pearse Ennis at the Eastport Summer School.  He published his first lithographs in 1931 and it soon became his preferred medium.  He became one of the most accomplished American lithographers of the 20th century, leading the great American realist painter, Andrew Wyeth (1917-2009), to praise Wengenroth as, \"America's greatest living artist working in black and white.\" While most of Wengenroth's 350-plus lithographs feature landscape and natural scenery of the eastern Atlantic coast, he returned to his New York roots for some of his most prized prints."
