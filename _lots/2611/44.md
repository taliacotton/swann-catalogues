A very good impression.<br><br>The first of Sloan's (1871-1951) \"New York City Life\" plates, Connoisseurs of Prints depicts an exhibition of prints to be auctioned at the old American Art Gallery, on East 23rd Street and Madison Square. Sloan (1871-1951) planned a series of \"Connoisseurs\" themed prints; however, this was the only one realized.  <br><br>According to Levin, \"Hopper may have first met John Sloan as early as April 1904, just after Sloan's move to New York where he lived in the same building as Robert Henri, but certainly by 1906 when Sloan substituted for Henri for one month at the New York School of Art.  For Hopper, Sloan represented one artist he could respect who prior to 1916 had worked regularly as a commercial illustrator.  Sloan's influence is particularly visible during Hopper's formative years,\" (Levin, Edward Hopper as Illustrator, New York, 1979, page 9).  Morse 127."
