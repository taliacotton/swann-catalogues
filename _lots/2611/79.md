TYPESET: "Pencil on cream wove paper, 1913. 200x250 mm; 7⅞x9⅞ inches.  Signed and dated in pencil, lower left recto.<br><br>Provenance: (with) Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, with the ink stamp verso; private collection, Atlanta. <br><br>Drawing similarities between the works of Marin (1870-1953) and his contemporaries with that of the Photo-Secessionists, led by Alfred Stieglitz (1864-1946), the George Eastman House, Rochester, mounted the exhibition, \"Photo-Secession: Photography as a Fine Art\" from October 15, 1960 to January 15, 1961.  The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York holds two Marin works on paper that appeared, uncredited, in this exhibition. <br><br>Stieglitz had first shown Marin's (1870-1953) work at his New York gallery, 291, in 1910 and continued to do so throughout Stieglitz's career.  The two remained close friends (Marin served as a witness to the Stieglitz's marriage to Georgia O'Keeffe), and shared an interest in depicting urban New York, often influencing each other's works."
