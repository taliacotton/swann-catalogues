The subject clearly interested Hopper, who produced at least two other drawings of the famous literary character from around this time period, which are now in the Whitney Museum of American Art (Josephine N. Hopper Bequest), New York, as well as the etching, Don Quixote, 1915-18 (Levin 12).<br><br>One of the motivators behind Hopper's interest in European art was his teacher during the early 1900s, Robert Henri (1865-1929).  As an art instructor, Henri preached originality and urged Hopper's further study of European art.  \"Hopper had heard Henri praise the work of European artists such as Daumier, Courbet, Degas, Manet, Renoir, Rembrandt, Hals, Velásquez, Goya, and El Greco, and like so many of Henri's students, felt he should travel to Europe to see the works of these great masters firsthand.  So, with his parents' help, he left for Paris in October 1906 and did not return until the following August,\" (Levin, Edward Hopper as Illustrator, New York, 1979, page 11)."
