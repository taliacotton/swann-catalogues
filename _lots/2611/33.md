Chase, who bears a strong resemblance to the sitter in the current portrait, established his own art school, which became the New York School of Art and Design, in 1896, and was an instructor there until 1907.  He was the elder statesman among the artists at the school, among the most talented and renowned 19th century American Impressionist artists, and an immensely influential teacher, fostering the early careers of artists such as George Bellows, Howard Chandler Christy, Charles Demuth, Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Georgia O'Keeffe, Joseph Stella and many others."
