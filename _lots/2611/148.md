TYPESET: "Lithograph, 1928.  205x302 mm; 8¼x7¾ inches, full margins.  Edition of 100.  Signed and dated in pencil, lower right.  Printed by George Miller, New York.  A superb, richly-inked and dark impression of this very scarce lithograph.<br><br>Gág (1893-1946) was primarily a printmaker; paintings and gouaches are scarce among her works.  She trained at the Art Students League, New York, under the instructors John Sloan, George Luks and Kenneth Hayes Miller, among others, and might have been influenced to begin making lithographs by the artist Adolf Dehn (1895-1968), with whom she was then romantically involved.  Along with her haunting lithographs of scenes in and around New York from the 1920s and 1930s, many of which are imbued with an eeriness and desolation reminiscent of Hopper, she is also remembered for her innovative and modern children's books, consisting of stories she told her younger siblings when growing up and illustrated herself, including Millions of Cats, Gone is Gone and The ABC Bunny.  Winnan 62."
