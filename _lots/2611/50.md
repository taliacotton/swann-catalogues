TYPESET: "Etching and aquatint, 1915.  256x308 mm; 10x12 inches, full margins.  Third state (of 3).  Edition of only 35 (from an intended edition of 100).  Signed, titled and inscribed \"100 proofs\" in pencil, lower margin.  A superb, richly-inked impression of this very scarce etching.  <br><br>According to Levin, \"Hopper may have first met John Sloan as early as April 1904, just after Sloan's move to New York where he lived in the same building as Robert Henri, but certainly by 1906 when Sloan substituted for Henri for one month at the New York School of Art.  For Hopper, Sloan represented one artist he could respect who prior to 1916 had worked regularly as a commercial illustrator.  Sloan's influence is particularly visible during Hopper's formative years,\" (Levin, Edward Hopper as Illustrator, New York, 1979, page 9).  Morse 173."
