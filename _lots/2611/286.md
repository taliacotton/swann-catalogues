He then studied at the Art Students League with George Bridgman in 1923 and later at the Grand Central School of Art with Wyman Adams.  It was not until 1929 that he started working in lithography with George Pearse Ennis at the Eastport Summer School.<br><br>He published his first lithographs in 1931 and it soon became his preferred medium.  In his lithographs he depicted New York as well as the Maine landscape.  In the 1950s he settled in Greenport, New York, with his family while continuing to travel throughout New England.
