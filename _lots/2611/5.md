His parents had not objected to his becoming an artist, but they encouraged him to study commercial illustration which offered a more secure income.  This must have seemed more practical to his father, who owned a drygoods store in Nyack and would have been familiar with advertising illustrations,\" (Levin, Edward Hopper as Illustrator, New York, 1979, page 9)."
