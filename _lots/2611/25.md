Marin exhibited at the Salone d'Automne several times, along with works by Henri Matisse, Édouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard, as well as alongside the 1907 Paul Cézanne retrospective.  Though surrounded by the excitement of the center of the art world, Marin's main influence at this time period was the artist James A. M. Whistler (1834-1903).  Marin's color palette, intimacy, and the spontaneity of the \"wet-on-wet\" technique echoed that of Whistler.  Meaux, a town northeast of Paris, dovetailed into Marin's early inclination towards picturesque, decorative subjects synonymous with the previous century.  Marin's  \"wet-on-wet\" technique, allowing for the blurring or melting of the subjects as in the current work, enabled him to fulfill the late 19th century tenet of the direct observation of the moment and the importance of conveying the instantaneous mood of the scene."
