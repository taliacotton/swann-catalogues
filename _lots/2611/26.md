DESCRIPT: "JOSEPH PENNELL"
CROSSHEAD: "Canyon, No. III."
TYPESET: "Etching on Japan paper, 1904.  300x125 mm; 11¾x4⅞ inches, full margins.  Edition of approximately 75.  Signed in pencil, lower center.  A very good, richly-inked impression.  <br><br>The influence of James A. M. Whistler is evident in Pennell’s (1857-1926) work with its often impressionistic line, but the artist often chose a modern subject.  Born in Pennsylvania, Pennell made London his home and did not return full-time to the United States until World War I.  He traveled twice to New York prior to that, in 1904 and 1908, and captured the changing character of the city with the growing number of skyscrapers, a reflection of his interest in depicting modern life through urban landscapes, factories and industry. Wuerth 338."
