  had invented color drypoint in 1943, a technique distinct from that of color etching.  John
  Taylor Arms, in a review of Borne's 1941 exhibition of drypoints at the Corcoran
  Gallery, Washington, D.C., wrote that the artist was "in such harmony with his medium
  that he is able, through it, to interpret his conceptions in terms of the printed
  line with clarity, without hesitation, and with a feeling of discerning and sensitive
  as it is forthright."  <br><br>Borne was born in Poland though immigrated with his
  family to the United States when he was 14 years old during World War I.  He studied
  at the Art Students League and the National Academy in New York.  While his subjects
  varied, his most striking scene is Rainy Night, which won the Frederick Talcott
  Prize from the Society of American Etchers in 1939.  In 1950, Borne and his wife
  moved from Brooklyn to Nyack, New York, where he founded the Tappan Zee Art Center.
