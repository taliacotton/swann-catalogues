Inscribed \"73\" in pencil, lower right recto. <br><br>Provenance: Private collection, New Jersey.<br><br>Carles (1882-1952) was born in Philadelphia and studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts between 1900 and 1907.  Like Edward Hopper and many of their contemporaries, Carles visited Paris (1907-10) for further artistic study.   In France, Carles greatly admired the works of Paul Cézanne and Henri Matisse, and became close friends with John Marin and Edward Steichen.  Carles's work was included in the 1910 “Younger American Painters” exhibit held at Alfred Stieglitz’s New York gallery, 291.  Stieglitz also gave Carles his first one-man show at 291 in January 1912.  Carles was among the most inventive creatively and brilliant colorists of the American modernist artists."
