  to Levin, "In 1899, after graduating from high school in his hometown of Nyack,
  New York, Hopper commuted to New York City daily to study illustration at the Correspondence
  School of Illustrating at 114 West Thirty-fourth Street.  His parents had not objected
  to his becoming an artist, but they encouraged him to study commercial illustration
  which offered a more secure income.  This must have seemed more practical to his
  father, who owned a drygoods store in Nyack and would have been familiar with advertising
  illustrations," (Levin, Edward Hopper as Illustrator, New York, 1979, page 9).'
