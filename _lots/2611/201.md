TYPESET: "Lithograph, 1935.  250x342 mm; 9¾x13½ inches, full margins.  Edition of only 8.  Signed in pencil, lower right.  A very good impression of this extremely scarce, first-known lithograph by Lewis. <br><br>According to McCarron, Lewis (1881-1962) used a combination of crayon lithography and tusche, the technique of using a brush to apply ink to the stone.  In 1934, Lewis had become involved in the formation of the School for Print Makers in New York and likely learned this lithographic technique from George Miller, a co-founder of the School.  Veterans was used by the American Artists Group as the image on a Christmas card, with the title Awaiting the Homecomers.  McCarron 113."
