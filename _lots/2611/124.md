TYPESET: "Lithograph printed in black on light tan Chine appliqu√©, 1929.  227x329 mm; 9x13 inches, full margins.  Signed and numbered 28/30 in pencil, lower margin.  A superb, dark impression of this early, extremely scarce lithograph.<br><br>Davis (1892-1964) was among the first American artists to begin experimenting with Cubism.  He studied painting with John Sloan and Robert Henri beginning in 1910 but, like John Marin, largely abandoned their Realist style after the Armory Show in 1913.  His 1931 lithograph Sixth Avenue El reflects an interest in Sloan and Henri's social realism, depicting a New York street scene, but also applies Cubist style and leans heavily towards abstraction.  Davis was also inspired by Jazz music and the concept of improvisation, particularly later in his career, giving his work a distinctly American quality.  Cole/Myers 6."
