  stretcher, verso.  <br><br>Provenance: Sragow Gallery, New York, purchased by the
  current owner, private collection, Toronto 1986.<br><br>Delaney (1904-1991) arrived
  in New York in 1930, enrolling in the Art Students League and studying under Alexander
  Brooke and Thomas Hart Benton.  Delaney took to heart the League''s belief in progressing
  uniquely American aesthetic and subjects.  He exhibited in the inaugural Washington
  Square Art Show in 1931, alongside Don Freeman and became employed by the Works
  Progress Administration until 1943.  Delaney had always expressed a natural curiosity
  in the daily lives of people in the city.  As in the present early work, he painted
  his observations of the quotidian without bias or political motive.  Delaney once
  said, "The curtain goes up on the stage of life every time we walk into the street."<br><br>Hopper
  enjoyed going to the movies and was inspired to paint his own version of the past
  time in 1939, his oil on canvas New York Movie, in the collection of the Museum
  of Modern Art, New York.  This painting evokes the isolation found in a room full
  of people, as the usherette rests against the balustrade of the theater''s interior
  while the audience, unnoticing, is entranced by the glowing projection.  Hopper
  used his sketches from the Strand, Palace, Republic and Globe theaters for the interior
  of the painting.'
