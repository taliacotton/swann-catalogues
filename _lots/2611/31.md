A superb impression of this scarce, early etching.<br><br>Sloan (1871-1951) noted in his diary, \"A sketch of my great friend and teacher, the distinguished painter, Robert Henri (1865-1929).  Drawn directly.  He posed for me one evening when he came over from New York for a day or two--on the occasion of his visit to Philadelphia just prior to my removal to New York.\"  Henri became Sloan's mentor in 1892 and the following year they co-founded the short-lived Charcoal Club, whose members would also include William Glackens, George Luks and Everett Shinn.  Sloan was still working as an illustrator in Philadelphia at the time and would ultimately move to New York in 1904, where he became of member of the group known as The Eight and one of the founders of the Ashcan school of American art, many of whose fellow artists—Sloan included—would interact with and have an impact on Hopper and vice versa.
