He studied with Kenneth Hayes Miller and Robert Henri (John Sloan was also an early influence). Illustration was an important way for artists to support themselves, and Henri, Sloan, George Luks and other significant artists of the time worked as illustrators.  Hopper engaged in illustration for about 20 years, starting in 1906 as a part-time illustrator for various advertising agencies in New York.  He illustrated for magazines such as Scribner's Magazine, Everybody’s and Country Gentleman as well as for specialty magazines like Hotel Management, The MorseDial and Wells Fargo Messenger."
