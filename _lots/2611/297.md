TYPESET: "Color screenprint, circa 1950.  363x465 mm; 14½x18½ inches, full margins.  Edition of approximately only 50.  Published by Esther Gentle, New York.  A superb impression of this scarce print with strong colors.<br><br>Based on the same-titled oil painting by Davis (1892-1964) now in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum, New York.<br><br>According to the Brooklyn Museum, \"Pad #4 is one of a series of four related pictures that Stuart Davis made while working on The Mellow Pad, a painting in the Brooklyn Museum’s collection.  In all of these works, the word pad appears—here, sideways in green at the upper left (and a number 4 is in white at the lower right).  This title reveals the artist’s fondness for wordplay: pad refers both to an artist’s sketchbook and to the jazz slang term for “home.”  A lifelong aficionado of jazz, Davis regularly drew analogies between the visual patterns of his pictures and the syncopated rhythms of this modern form of American music.\""
