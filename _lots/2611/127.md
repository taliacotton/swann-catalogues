DESCRIPT: EDWARD HOPPER
CROSSHEAD: The Railroad.
TYPESET: Etching, 1922.  200x248 mm; 7⅞x9¾ inches, full margins.  Eighth state (of
  8).  Signed and titled twice in pencil, lower margin.  A superb, richly-inked impression
  of this extremely scarce etching with very strong contrasts.  <br><br>We have found
  only two other impressions of this etching at auction in the past 30 years. <br><br>According
  to Carl Zigrosser, Hopper "does not number his prints and has fixed one hundred
  as the outside limit of impressions taken.  This does not mean that there are one
  hundred proofs of each subject in existence.  The artist prints them as the occasion
  demands.  He has done his own printing except for Night Shadows, where the plate
  was turned over to Peter Platt for the printing of a large edition published by
  the New Republic."<br><br>The conté crayon preparatory drawing for this etching
  is now in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, accession number 1962-30-5a,b.<br><br>Hopper
  first became interested in etching through Charles Meryon's prints of Paris which
  highlight the city's architecture.  After encouragement from friend and fellow artist
  Martin Lewis, Hopper embarked on printmaking in 1915.  The emotional tension in
  Hopper's paintings were soon present in his etchings, much of which were completed
  between 1919 and 1923.  After completing his last etching, The Balcony in 1928 and
  achieving success as an artist, Hopper focused on oils and watercolors.  Admittedly,
  Hopper later recalled, "After I took up etching, my painting seemed to crystalize."
  <br><br>Though Hopper (1882-1967) claimed that his etchings, unlike his paintings,
  were not based on a specific observation or model (with the exception of House at
  Tarrytown), their styles are still based in realism with great emotional depth.  Intimate,
  isolated, fleeting moments are conveyed by Hopper's deliberate burin on copper plates
  (he also made some dry points on zinc).  Perhaps needing to express a more heightened
  moodiness in his prints through contrast, Hopper sought out the blackest ink on
  the market to be printed on stark white paper.  He wrote to Zigrosser, "The best
  prints were done on an Italian paper called 'Umbria' and was the whitest paper I
  could get.  The ink was an intense black that I sent for to Kimber in London, as
  I could not get an intense enough black here.  I had heard so much of the beauty
  of old paper, but it did not give me the contrast and brilliance that I wanted,
  and I did not use it."  Urban scenes, nocturnes, and train subjects, like in the
  current work, feature largely in Hopper's printed œuvre, a similarity with Martin
  Lewis, while coastal scenes and boats, which are rife in Hopper's paintings rarely
  make an appearance in his etchings, perhaps because they lend themselves to high
  contrast so easily. Not only did Hopper employ his materials for visual impact,
  but also used unusual vantage points, such as in Night Shadows, in which the scene
  is viewed from above.  Lewis, who reached his stride by the time Hopper abandoned
  etching in 1928, drew on much of the same subject matter and a heightened sense
  of drama, qualities which went on to characterize the American Scene artists.  Levin
