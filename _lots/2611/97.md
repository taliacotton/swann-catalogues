  Hopper, Cooperstown, 2011, page 30, figure 30 (illustrated).<br><br>This double-sided
  sheet of drawings by Hopper (1882-1967) appears to have four distinct though perhaps
  related studies.  The drawing upper recto represents figures in an interior, possibly
  a dance hall.  The composition, with the figures in front of the wall and row of
  windows that recede diagonally from lower left to upper right, recalls Hopper''s
  etching, House Tops, 1921 (Levin 79).  The study lower recto shows a building exterior
  with a suggestion of clouds in the background and most likely a separate architectural
  detail.  The verso is also bisected with two drawings: above is an interior study,
  possibly a theatre or dance hall, and below a geometric, architectural detail.<br><br>Hopper''s
  artistic process involved the creation of numerous sketches ranging from quick compositional
  ideas to small details in the pictures.  Hopper once noted, “I make various small
  sketches, sketches of the thing that I wish to do, also sketches of details in the
  picture.”  For his iconic oil painting Nighthawks, 1942, Hopper created many small
  scale sketches and storyboards, focusing on details from the hands of the man holding
  a cigarette to the coffee urns on the cafe counter top.  After creating a multitude
  of sketches, Hopper made a final study of all the elements together before embarking
  on the final oil painting.'
