Born in Columbus, Ohio he worked as a commercial illustrator as a student at The Ohio State University from 1901-04.  After Ohio State, he moved to New York where he studied with Robert Henri and soon became associated with the Aschan artists.  He depicted scenes of everyday life in New York that were rooted in realism.  While he was known for his urban scenes, he also created many portraits throughout his career capturing the spirit of the sitter, often who were friends or family members, with a more delicate and detailed touch."
