TYPESET: "Etching, 1929.  300x250 mm; 11⅞x9⅞ inches, wide margins.  Signed in pencil, lower right.  A very good, richly-inked impression. <br><br>According to artist Theresa Bernstein, Meyerowitz's wife, Meyerowitz (1887-1981) had started to etch early in his career, and worked with the same press throughout his life, printing his plates personally in one stage.  While many artists rely on large format support for their abstract works, Meyerowitz was able to achieve the same flattened effect and intricate patterns using small etching plates, delicate lines, and nuanced technique."
