  (1895-1987) was best known for her realistic representations of everyday life and
  her satirical caricatures.  She studied at the Art Students League, New York, with
  Kenneth Hayes Miller, John Sloan and George Bellows, and taught herself drypoint
  there in between drawing classes.  Looking back at her time at the League, Bacon
  said, "The years at the Art Students League were a very important chunk of life
  to me and very exhilarating.  It was the first time in my life, of course, that
  I had met and gotten to know familiarly a group of young people who were all headed
  the same way with the same interests.  In fact it was practically parochial."  From
  the 1910s to the  1930s, she worked mainly in drypoint printmaking and also doing
  illustrations for the satirical magazine Bad News, while her later drawings appeared
  as illustrations in publications including The New Yorker, New Republic, Fortune
  and Vanity Fair.  She further went on to illustrate over 60 books, 19 of which she
  also wrote.<br><br>Bacon exhibited frequently in New York from the 1910s onward,
  with galleries including Alfred Stieglitz''s Intimate Gallery, the Weyhe Gallery
  and the Downtown Gallery (she had more than 32 solo exhibitions during her career),
  and was closely connected with other artists with ties to these galleries, including
  Katherine Schmidt and Yasuo Kuniyoshi.'
