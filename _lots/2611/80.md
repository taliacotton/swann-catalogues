A dark, richly-inked impression of this exceedingly scarce, etching.<br><br>Stieglitz, who published this work and many of Marin's (1870-1953) early New York etchings, had first shown Marin's work at his New York gallery, 291, in 1910 and continued to do so throughout Stieglitz's career.  The two remained close friends (Marin served as a witness to the Stieglitz's marriage to Georgia O'Keeffe), and shared an interest in depicting urban New York, often influencing each other's works.
