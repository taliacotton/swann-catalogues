  title: Beauford Delaney in 1951
  author: ' In 1951, writer Brooks Atkinson noted, "No one knows exactly how Beauford
    lives. Pegging away at a style of painting that few people understand or appreciate,
    he has disciplined himself, not only physically but spiritually, to live with
    a kind of personal magnetism in a barren world." Two years later, Delaney left
    New York for Paris.<br><br>"Carl Van Vechten, <i>Beauford Delaney</i>. Carl Van

  title: Richmond Barthé in 1937
  author: ''
  body: "These three sculptures by Richmond Barthé (lots 21-23) display the work of
    an artist at the height of his career. Barthé was establishing himself as a leading
    American sculptor of the modern period with his new representation of the male
    figure – dynamic, muscular and black. His vision culminated in his mid-1930s series
    of African dancers, including the iconic _Feral Benga._ Barthé achieved new levels
    of naturalism in bronze as his passion for his subjects was perfectly matched
    with his superb technical skill. This was reinforced with the wide acclaim Barthé
    received for his figures, including _African Boy Dancing_, shown at the 1937 prestigious
    exhibition _Dance International, 1900 – 1937_ at the Rockefeller Center, New York.
