    At the turn of the twentieth century, artists began to confront the dominance of European academic influences within the American art sphere. In search of a new status quo, leading American artists began to challenge these systems—such as the National Academy of Design and the American Impressionists—in hopes to create and define an American artistic identity. As artists became aligned with the Ashcan School and began depicting New York in a Realist style, they found themselves not only transforming the status quo, but leading an emergent avant-garde movement.

    A group of artists known as The Eight were the most definitive pushback against the traditional academic system. They included Robert Henri (the  leader), as well as Everett Shinn, John Sloan, Arthur B. Davies, Ernest Lawson, Maurice Prendergast, George Luks and[ ](https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-J-Glackens)William J. Glackens. Together they exhibited their work at the Macbeth Galleries in 1908 in an exhibition outside the system that was meant to challenge it. They wanted to create an American aesthetic and while they painted in different styles, most — including Henri and Sloan — embraced a Realist manner showing the struggles of life for the working class in New York City.

    Five of the members of The Eight became associated with The Aschan School, a loose group of artists that followed Henri’s mantra of “art for life’s sake”. They strove to depict a New York City that included working class people and immigrants. Immigration surged in the late nineteenth century and first decade of the twentieth century. A second generation consisted of Robert Henri’s New York students, of whom George Bellows was the most devoted.

    Around this time, Edward Hopper was living in New York. As a student, his parents pushed him to study illustration and pursue classes at both the Correspondence School of Illustrating and at the New York School of Art. He studied with Kenneth Hayes Miller and Robert Henri (John Sloan was also an early influence). Hopper worked in illustration for about 20 years, starting in 1906 as a part-time illustrator for various advertising agencies in New York. He illustrated for magazines such as _Scribner's Magazine_, _Everybody’s_ and _Country Gentleman_ as well as for specialty magazines, including _Hotel Management_, _The Morse Dial_ and _Wells Fargo Messenger_. Illustration was an important way for artists to support themselves, and Henri, Sloan, Luks and other significant artists of the time worked as illustrators to provide secure earnings. Towards the end of the decade, Hopper traveled to Europe, and spent two long sojourns in Paris, where he overlapped with many of his contemporaries, and admired the work of the Old Masters as well as, Manet and Degas for their depictions of modern life.

    The Ashcan artists were seen as the avant-garde in American art, but the European modernists were on the cusp of being introduced. An early supporter of European modern art in New York was Alfred Stieglitz who opened a gallery in 1905 called the 291 Gallery. He began to exhibit cutting-edge European art in 1908. Stieglitz also despised the gatekeeping incited by The National Academy of the Arts. In response, he showcased European contemporaries with drawings by Auguste Rodin, and artists less known in America, including Cézanne, Matisse and Picasso. The first exhibition of Matisse's work ever held in the United States, which included _Nude in the Forest_ (1906), exhibited at 291 Gallery. These exhibitions set the stage for a defining moment in art of the twentieth century: the 1913 Armory Show, which opened in its first iteration at the 69th Regiment Armory on Park Avenue and 25th Street, New York, across the street from Swann Auction Galleries' current location.

    Inspired by time spent in Europe, around 1910, Arthur Dove became the first American artist to paint an abstract painting. At this time, abstract art was still largely unknown by many American artists. That would change in 1913 with the Armory Show, which became a catalyst for modern artists to embrace European influences.

    In 1911, the Association of American Painters and Sculptors was created to host a large invitational show that included European artists. Walt Kuhn and Arthur B. Davies ran the association and organized the exhibition, choosing the 69th Regiment Armory as its location. The exhibition included three hundred artists, living and dead, and around 1,300 works of art. The earliest works were by Ingres, Delacroix and Goya; overall, it showed the development of modern art in Europe (although some key artists were excluded). Overall, it was a media sensation. The work of Marcel Duchamp whose _Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2_ created an uproar of revulsion and led to a debate on the nature of art itself.  American artists were included in the exhibition, but their work appeared provincial next to their European counterparts.

    After the European prominence exhibited at the Armory show, many artists and dealers felt the absence of a national aesthetic and dedicated themselves to giving modernism a true American voice. During this decade, Stieglitz focused on exhibiting American artists; he had a close-knit circle including John Marin, Marsden Hartley, Arthur Dove, Max Weber, Arthur B. Carles, Abraham Walkowitz and Georgia O’Keeffe. While Stieglitz’s space focused on exhibiting artists looking towards Europe and abstraction, the Whitney Studio supported those continuing to work in a Realist style. In 1914, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney started the Whitney Studio, a building funded by the heiress and society sculptor, and held exhibitions to nurture artists. She favored realist artists such as Sloan and Luks. In 1918, it officially transitioned to the Whitney Studio Club and the space grew to include exhibition galleries, a squash court, library, salon and billiard rooms.

    In 1910, Hopper returned from his time abroad and in 1913 settled in his studio at Washington Square Park North where he would remain for the rest of his career. His work was included in the Armory show; in fact, it was where he sold his first painting _Sailing._ In 1915, he took up etching and would produce around 70 etchings over the next decade. He learned the etching process from Martin Lewis, another printmaker working in New York, who captured the city at night, exploring light and shadow. Through printmaking Hopper found critical and commercial success. He also found his signature style of depicting ordinary city or rural scenes with a pervading sense of loneliness. Printmaking was essential to developing Hopper’s artistic voice, and he noted that "After I took up etching, my painting seemed to crystallize."

    As artists continued to develop an American modern art, there were profound changes to global political stability. The carnage of World War I was impossible to ignore. Charles Burchfield recorded his fear of being drafted in his diaries and Georgia O’Keeffe’s brother enlisted immediately. George Bellows was explicit of his view of war in his work; his _War Series_ was a group of lithographs that depicted atrocities of war carried out by the Germans. Stieglitz closed 291 in 1917 due to financial difficulties caused by the war and decided to focus on his own photography.

    The 1920s were a time of prosperity in America. World War I had ended and the pessimism of the 1910s turned into optimism for modern life. American artists continued to focus on developing their artistic voices and both institutions and galleries were formed to bring their work to a broader audience.

    Politically, the 1920s was a period of isolationism, and this thinking affected the cultural interests of the country. There was a push to define American art was outside of European influences. Folk Art emerged in this decade as a form of primitive American art. In 1929, Edith Halpert along with Holger Cahill started the American Folk Art Gallery as the first space where American folk art was promoted and sold. In a similar vein, in 1926, the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg started, financed by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. to preserve a colonial American town.

    Artists also continued to find their voices beyond the influences of Europe. Around 1920, some American artists began to work in a new style, Precisionism, that controlled and diluted form down to basic shapes. Artists like Charles Demuth, Charles Sheeler, Elsie Driggs, Ralston Crawford, and Louis Lozowick, found some inspiration in European models such as Cubism, but chose subjects that were undoubtedly American and emblematic of modern life: urban landscapes, steel mills, and factories. The Precisionist preoccupation with "the machine" made sense: in the 1920s there was a great deal of optimism surrounding what factories and machines could build. In 1927, the Machine-Age Exposition held in New York brought together artists and engineers to exhibit architecture, the industrial arts and fine art together in one space. Works by Demuth and Sheeler were displayed next to cogs and motorboat propellers to create a machine-age aesthetic that exhibited the possibilities of modern life.

    Realism, however, still had its place in American art. During the 1920s, a group of artists set up studios around Union Square and 14th street. They were fittingly called The Fourteenth Street school and focused on figuration. Artists like Isabel Bishop, Raphael Soyer and Reginald Marsh depicted the urban environment and its inhabitants. Unlike the Ashcan School, they were less focused on the city’s poor, but instead, highlighted the figure of the New Woman who worked and lived outside the home.

    During this decade Hopper worked to solidify his standing as a working artist rather than an illustrator. In 1923, six of his watercolors were included in the Brooklyn Museum’s International Watercolor Exhibition and the Brooklyn Museum bought _Mansard Roof._ The following year, he quit working as an illustrator to focus on his painting. He also married his wife Josephine “Jo” Verstille Nivison, who was hi record keeper and often modeled for him. During the 1920s the artist sold works to the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and to the collector Duncan Phillips. By the end of the decade, he sold _House by the Railroad_ (1925) to The Museum of Modern Art—the first painting by any artist to enter the museum’s permanent collection.

    Museums and galleries were opened during this decade to specifically support American artists. The Museum of Modern Art was founded in 1929 to challenge traditional museums and provide a space where modern art could be displayed. Its first exhibition was “Cezanne, Gauguin, Seurat, Van Gogh,” but it turned its attention to Contemporary European and American artists shortly thereafter. Stieglitz returned to exhibition work when he opened the Intimate Gallery in 1925; he showed the works of American artists in his inner circle: Demuth, Dove, Hartley, Marin and O’Keeffe. He continued exhibiting their work at his gallery, An American Place, which opened in 1929. Edith Halpert started the Downtown Gallery in 1926 as a place where contemporary American artists could sell their work.

    In 1929 with the stock market crash, the prosperity and hopefulness of the decade ended. Nevertheless, the decade that followed would bring unprecedented opportunities for artists in America.

    The stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed changed American society and politics irrevocably. The decade was an extraordinary opportunity for artists to find employment through the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and was also a time during which divergent approaches towards American art solidified, creating tension between artists as to what constituted true American art.

    In Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to the Great Depression by creating The New Deal to restore prosperity to Americans. Artists benefitted significantly from its programs, and from 1933 to 1934 the Public Works of Art Project created jobs for artists in the form of producing murals for public housing, courthouses and post offices. In 1935, it transformed into the Federal Art Project, employing artists through 1943. These programs championed a Realist approach to their compositions since artists were often hired to focus on historical subjects and specific locales. Stuart Davis and other abstract artists were occasionally hired, but these programs were a boon for Regionalist and Realist sensibilities.

    Overall, during the decade Regionalism grew in popularity. Thomas Hart Benton, John Steuart Curry and Grant Wood opposed the urbanization of the country, the concentration of money on Wall Street and the intellectualism of the East Coast. Rural areas were especially hit hard during the Depression, but they had also experienced a recession since the end of World War I. Regionalist paintings and prints are steeped in nostalgia and depicted the American farmer as the soul of American. In 1933, there was an exhibit at the Kansas Art Institute of works by Benton, Curry and Wood. Maynard Walker, the organizer, said it was a new direction for American art that sprang from Midwest soil. In 1934, when Benton graced the cover of _Time_ magazine, he became one of America’s most famous artists.

    Realism was not relegated to the Midwest:, in New York artists like Reginald Marsh and Ben Shahn depicted social life and the activities of city dwellers, including bawdy entertainment and realities of day-to-day life. Edward Hopper, also considered a Realist, was an outlier; He didn’t depict the social environment of the city. Instead, his New York was quiet, focusing on its emptiness through light and form. He continued to become one of the most praised American modernists. In 1933, MoMA opened _Edward Hopper: Retrospective Exhibition,_ which included a separate room dedicated to his etchings, the first show in which etchings had such importance. The catalog included an introduction from Alfred Barr who praised Hopper as a great American modernist. Nevertheless, some criticized Hopper’s Realist style for not being modern enough.

    The reception of Hopper’s MoMA exhibit speaks to a larger fight playing out among artists as they defined American art — Stuart Davis and Thomas Hart Benton battled publicly in art publications in the 1930s. Benton thought Davis’s work was not American enough since the Abstract American Artists were looking towards Europe for inspiration. Benton believed there was still room for the figure in modern art. It is important to note, however, that even the European modernists conveyed a strong sense of place in their art and were regionally aligned. Although the artists believed they had little common ground in this struggle for dominance, they both laid claim to the inherent value of their approach as they sought authentic and independent voices that could speak for the nation.

    In a broader sense, the public found access to an art that was shaped by an American identity. In addition to Hopper’s 1933 exhibition, art exhibitions began to focus on contemporary American art. In 1931, the Whitney Museum opened with Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney’s collection after it was rejected by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and its mandate was to display and collect works by contemporary artists. Many of its exhibitions were devoted to Realists such as Hopper, but it also displayed modernists working in international styles, including Davis. In 1931-33, Rockefeller Center was constructed with murals by leading American artists. This was, of course, also not free from scandal, as Diego Rivera’s mural _Man at the Crossroads_ was destroyed because it depicted socialist themes and Vladimir Lenin.

    The growth of Communism and Fascism abroad resulted in an undercurrent in American society and art throughout the decade. America’s population had doubled between 1890 and 1930, and by 1929 one in 10 Americans were born abroad or had an immigrant parent. Many artists themselves were born outside the U.S. or were first generation Americans and were loosely aligned with political movements. However, most artists who were affiliated with the Communist party in the 1930s abandoned it when Stalin signed a nonaggression pact with Hitler in 1939. Artists were more interested in depicting social protest than radical political movements. As the growth of Fascism loomed across the Atlantic, European artists moved to New York to escape conflict and persecution. By the end of the decade, the city was poised to become a new artistic center of the world.

  body: "The 1940s was a decade of conflicting paths for artists. If Benton was still
    America’s most popular artist at the beginning of the decade the climate changed
    dramatically as New York established itself as the leading international center
    for art. \n\nRepresentational art continued with the work of the Regionalists,
    and others such as Ben Shahn and Charles Burchfield. Edward Hopper continued to
    paint, solidifying his place as a great American modernist with his painting _Nighthawks_
    in 1942. Non-representational art also proliferated, supported by a growing number
    of organizations like the Museum of Non-Objective Painting (opened in 1939).\n\nHowever,
    while American artists had organized themselves and were trying to find an American
    voice, European artists were fleeing the war and making their way to New York.
    America joined the Allies in fighting Germany in 1941 after Pearl Harbor. While
    some young artists left New York to fight, refugee artists from Europe arrived
    in New York and inserted themselves in artistic circles. The Surrealists, including
    Max Ernst and André Breton, arrived in the early 1940s. In 1941, Fernand Léger
    and Piet Mondrian were invited to join the American Abstract Artists group. While
    in the past, American artists were able to view European modern works of art in
    galleries or museums, now they were engaging with their creators on a personal
    level. New York became the center of exchanged ideas and innovation.\n\nAlso fleeing
    Europe was Peggy Guggenheim, the heiress and collector of modern European art
    who opened her gallery Art of This Century in 1942. It served a threefold purpose:
    a space for Guggenheim to display her own collection of European modernists, a
    gallery where she sold works of art, and a gathering place for artists. Guggenheim
    gave Jackson Pollock, who had trained with Thomas Hart Benton, his first show
    in 1943. He was working in a surrealistic style at the beginning of the decade,
    but by 1947 his drip technique emerged.\n\nThe 1940s were marked by the emergence
    of the New York School and Abstract Expressionism. Artists like Pollock, Lee Krasner,
    Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, Adolph Gottlieb and Robert Motherwell were moving
    increasingly towards abstraction. Their abstractions had bold, expressive and
    spontaneous brushstrokes. Rooted in the Surrealist concept of tapping the unconscious,
    the artists aimed to make paintings that had an immediacy of expression. Their
    work was supported by important New York art critics like Clement Greenberg and
    Harold Rosenberg.\n\nBy the end of the decade, New York had emerged as the new
    center of the art world and American artists were steadily leading the way in
    emerging forms of expression."
