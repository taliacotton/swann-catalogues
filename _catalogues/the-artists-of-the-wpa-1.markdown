  title: 'Howard Cook - The New England Valley '
  author: ''
  body: "Howard Cook, most widely known for his lyrical prints of Manhattan, was born
    in Massachusetts and traveled the continental United States extensively. As a
    young man, he moved to New York and enrolled in the Art Students League. He studied
    printmaking there under Joseph Pennell (1857-1926) who, nearing the end of his
    life, was characterized by his atmospheric cityscape etchings. Cook's interest
    in the medium increased after a trip to Paris in 1925, where he spent time with
    fellow ex-pats and master printmakers James E. Allen (1894-1964) and Thomas Handforth
    (1897-1948).  \n  \nCook's career took off after a 1926 trip to Maine, when woodcuts
    he made there were picked up by _Forum_, one of the most widely-circulated American
    magazines at the time. The publication subsequently commissioned Cook to create
    woodcuts of the American Southwest, where he became enamored with New Mexico and
    the Taos artist's colony, returning throughout his life (he relocated there permanently
    in 1939 and ultimately died in Santa Fe). By the end of the 1920s, Cook's adept
    printmaking caught the interest of Carl Zigrosser (1891-1975), the esteemed director
    of the Weyhe Gallery in New York who supported many emerging artists. In 1929,
    Zigrosser both hosted Cook's first solo exhibition and encouraged him to travel
    to Paris, providing him entr√©e into the venerable lithography studio Atelier Desjobert.
    Despite experimenting in a range of printmaking techniques, the woodcut remained
    Cook's medium of choice.  \n  \nAt the peak of his career, from the late 1920s
    until his 1939 move to New Mexico, Cook feverishly depicted a rapidly-changing
    New York. Construction on skyscrapers flourished in the interwar period, with
    landmark towers like the Chrysler Building completed in 1930 and the Empire State
    Building completed the following year, while the Great Depression halted progress
    on other projects and construction sites remained commonplace. Cook was employed
    by the Works Progress Administration during this time. Artists like Cook, Louis
    Lozowick (1892-1973), and Samuel Margolies (1897-1974) embraced the evolving city
    as their subject, using exaggerated perspective to emphasize the grandeur of buildings,
    and portraying construction workers as everyday heroes."
