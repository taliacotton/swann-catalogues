  title: NAOMI SAVAGE
  author: ''
  body: Born Naomi Siegler, Savage was a native of Princeton, New Jersey.  Her parents
    were Samuel Siegler and Elsie Siegler (née Radnitzky), a sister of Man Ray.  She
    first studied photography under Berenice Abbott at the New School for Social Research
    in 1943, and afterward attended Bennington College from 1944 until 1947 to study
    art, photography and music.  She spent a year after her graduation in California
    with her uncle, Man Ray, studying his techniques.  In 1950 she married the architect
    and sculptor David Savage, with whom she moved to Paris, living there for some
    years.  Savage was heavily influenced by Man Ray, prompting her to experiment
    with the medium of photography, combining traditional techniques with more unusual
    processes, including some of her own design.

  title: JUNKO YODA
  author: ''
  body: Yoda was born in Tokushima, Japan and studied at Musashino Art University
    in Tokyo.  She moved to New York in 1969 and had her first solo exhibition with
    the Zabriskie Gallery in New York and Paris in 1980.  Originally working with
    oil on canvas, she then switched to working with acrylic and washi, a traditional
    Japanese paper.  Layering two to three sheets of handmade washi, she then colors
    it with acrylic paint creating textural works that are inspired by topographical
    views of nature.

  title: MARY FRANK
  author: ''
  body: Frank was born in London and moved to the United States as a child in 1940.  Dance,
    rather than painting or sculpture, was her early passion.  She studied with Martha
    Graham (1894-1991) who influenced the remainder of her career even after she stopped
    dancing and began working as a sculptor and painter.  Largely self-taught, she
    had some formal artistic training, studying wood carving at Alfred van Loen’s
    studio, drawing with Max Beckmann (1884-1950) at the Brooklyn Museum Art School,
    and taking night classes with Hans Hofmann (1880-1966) at his Eight Street School.  Her
    early works explored mythological and primitive themes in a variety of sculpture
    mediums and drawing. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, she began to work
    with clay, which became a preferred medium for its malleability.  Her ceramic
    sculptures often depict the human body in motion in fluid form, evoking her time
    spent studying dance.  Later in her career, she turned increasingly towards painting
    and embracing color.  In 1969, she started exhibiting with the Zabriskie Gallery
    who would show her work over the following decades. Her work can be found in the
    permanent collections of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The National Museum of
    American Art at the Smithsonian Institution and The Art Institute of Chicago,
    among others.

  title: SHIRLEY GOLDFARB
  author: ''
  body: Goldfarb was represented by Virginia Zabriskie in Paris and New York.  Goldfarb
    was a contemporary of the New York School, attending the Art Students League in
    1949 where she met Jackson Pollock (1912-1956).  Goldfarb did not stay in New
    York for long after her studies. She continued to paint in the Abstract Expressionist
    style into the 1960s.  In 1954, she moved to Paris, where she forged her career
    as an abstract artist with an unshakable identity.  Goldfarb embraced the Parisian
    art scene and was welcomed into the same circles as Man Ray (1890-1976) and other
    American ex-pats.  Distance from New York perhaps led her to develop her unique
    style which blended French pointillism, sophisticated color theory, and her roots
    in abstraction.

  title: EMILIO CRUZ
  author: ''
  body: A New York native, Cruz began his career associated with New York artists
    Lester Johnson, Jan Muller and Bob Thompson--artists who all applied the principles
    of Abstract Expressionism to figurative imagery.  Of Cuban descent, Cruz spent
    the majority of his life in New York, excluding the 1970s when he taught at the
    School of the Art Institute of Chicago.  His work is also found in the collections
    of the Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Studio Museum in Harlem,
    New York and the Hirshhorn Museum, Washington, D.C.

  title: LESTER JOHNSON
  author: ''
  body: "Johnson came to New York in 1947 after studying at the Minneapolis School
    of Art and the St. Paul Art School.  He was befriended by his neighbors Wolf Kahn
    and Larry Rivers during the 1950s before moving to Columbus as an Artist-in-Residence
    at Ohio State University from 1961-62.  He followed this post with a residence
    at the University of Wisconsin and a supplementary academic career at Yale University.\n\nJohnson
    was one of a group of young New York School artists who summered in Springs, East
    Hampton in the 1950s and 60s.  He would return to Springs throughout his career
    and counted Saul Steinberg and Willem and Elaine Kooning as neighbors.\n\nThough
    Johnson’s work was characterized as Abstract Expressionism, he departed from this
    already loosely defined canon by including figures and interior forms.  His physically
    vigorous technique of action painting created portraits with a breadth of tangible
    presences--from exuberant joy to isolated stoicism to existential despair.   In
    the 1970s Johnson moved to portraying colorful narrative crowded street scenes.
    \ \n\nLike Pat Adams (born 1928) and Clinton Hill (1922-2003),  Johnson was represented
    by Korman Galleries before the roster was inherited by Virginia Zabriskie.  His
    work would be shown by Zabriskie in New York and Paris several times from 1954
    to 1985, helping to cement his position as a leading figure in the New York school."

  title: RICHARD STANKIEWICZ
  author: ''
  body: |-
    Zabriskie Gallery represented Stankiewicz from 1972 to 2009, and promoted his work with conviction.  Often called “Junk Art”, Stankiewicz’s works were created from discarded scrap metal welded together into abstract figures.  He titled his works in reference to what the figures were according to his imagination, which often had a sense of humor.  As the separate scraps come together in rhythmic, buoyant forms, the culmination transcends the “Junk Art” label.

    Stankiewicz’s work is an extension of his biography.  In 1928, Stankiewicz and his mother moved from Philadelphia to the Rust Belt city of Detroit.  During the Great Depression, they lived in a small apartment neighboring a foundry dump, where Stankiewicz used to play and create his own toys from the scrap.  He studied mechanical drafting before entering the Navy in 1941.  While he was stationed in the Pacific, Stankiewicz would carve figures from found wood and animal bones.  After his service, he moved to New York and studied under Hans Hofmann, followed by instruction from Fernand Léger and sculptor Ossip Zadkine in Paris.  Back in New York by 1952, Stankiewicz helped to found the Hansa Gallery alongside Wolf Kahn, where he would show his welded scrap metal sculptures.  He was widely exhibited in New York and internationally, though Stankiewicz felt that the market for his work had cooled in 1965 since he had moved to Massachusetts.  Finding fault with his representation at Stable Gallery at the time, he did not exhibit in New York until connecting with Zabriskie in 1972.  His work came back to New York with new vigor.  Stankiewicz had discovered new materials and was working at a larger scale with the same levity as before, occasionally including kinetic elements in his works.  The Zabriskie Gallery held eighteen solo exhibitions of Stankiewicz’s work over two decades.

  title: ROBERT CONOVER
  author: ''
  body: Conover was born in Philadelphia and studied at the Philadelphia Museum School
    before moving to New York where he attended the Art Students League and the Brooklyn
    Museum School.  His first solo exhibition was held at Laurel Gallery, New York
    in 1950 and before long Conover became noticed for his flat, angular abstractions.  Only
    a year after being represented in The Museum of Modern Art's "Abstract Painting
    and Sculpture in America," Conover was lauded by one critic as "one of our most
    talented newcomers."  Conover exhibited at the New Gallery, New York and his prints
    were exhibited at The MoMA in the 1953 "Young American Printmakers" exhibition
    before showing his paintings at Zabriskie Gallery in 1960.

  title: WILFRID ZOGBAUM
  author: ''
  body: Zogbaum studied art at the Rhode Island School of Design and Yale School of
    Art, but it was his time spent with Hans Hofmann that greatly influenced his career.  After
    his studies, he won a Guggenheim Fellowship and traveled extensively throughout
    Europe, meeting artists such as Wassily Kandinsky and Fernand Léger, which cemented
    his interest in pursuing abstraction as an art form. Returning to New York, he
    worked as a commercial photographer professionally to survive, while continuing
    to create his own abstract art before dedicating himself exclusively to his career
    as an artist in 1948.  Having started his career as a painter, he switched to
    creating sculptures in the 1950s.  He gained his reputation mostly for his sculptural
    work, which was extremely innovative for its time, and incorporated found objects
    such as machine parts and natural elements like stones.

  title: ELLA BERGMANN-MICHEL
  author: ''
  body: Born in Paderborn, Germany, Bergmann-Michel was an early espouser of Constructivism.  She
    started making collages by 1915 and from 1917-20 studied at the Weimar Hochschule
    für Bildenden Kunste under the German painter Walther Klemm (1893-1957).  Throughout
    her career, she introduced innovations to the collage medium, including incorporating
    poetry and being among the first artists to utilize photography.  Together with
    her husband, Robert Michel (1897-1983), she became known as a pioneer of using
    photographs in collage.  In 1920, the couple moved to Vockenhausen, near Frankfurt,
    Germany, where she continued her work in photo-collages and ink drawings in the
    Constructivist style, however, during World War II her artistic output waned until
    the political climate was safer for her to continue to make and promote abstract
    art.

  title: PAULE VÉZELAY
  author: ''
  body: |-
    Vézelay was born Marjorie Watson-Williams in Bristol, England.  She studied at the Slade School of Fine Art and the London School of Art before starting her career in London, as a figurative painter, where she had her first show in 1921.

    In 1926, she moved to France and changed her name to Paule Vézelay, possibly with the intention of aligning herself with the _avant-garde_ School of Paris. Her move to Paris coincided with her abandonment of figurative painting in 1928 and she dedicated herself exclusively to abstraction.  While living in France she gained success and recognition, and in the 1930s she became a member of the French abstract movement, _Abstraction-Création_.  During her time in Paris she also met and fell in love with André Masson (1896-1987) with whom she had a relationship for several years.

    The onset of World War II forced her return to London where she had difficulty gaining the same type of respect from the British art community as she had in France. Nevertheless, she remained committed to abstract art, often in the form of floating, quasi-biomorphic shapes.  She engaged in innovative approaches to abstraction through her thread and wire constructions, which are seen as a significant contribution to the modern abstract artistic movement and rank among her most original works.

    In 1952, the artist and publisher André Bloc (1896-1966) invited her to form a London branch of the Parisian Constructivist abstract movement _Groupe Espace_. She also formed a small group of British abstract artists who held an exhibition in 1955 at the Royal Festival Hall, which predated and anticipated the watershed 1956 Whitechapel Gallery exhibition, "This is Tomorrow."  She was one of the first British artists to commit wholly to abstraction and her achievements were recognized with a retrospective exhibition at the Tate, London in 1983.

  title: BALCOMB AND GERTRUDE GREENE
  author: ''
  body: |-
    Balcomb (1904-1990) and Gertrude Greene (1904-1956) were among the earliest American artists to produce abstract art, creating experimental, non-objective works in the 1930s.  Balcomb began his career studying and teaching psychology, while Gertrude focused her early studies on sculpture at the Leonardo da Vinci School in New York.  When the couple married in 1926, they moved to Vienna where Balcomb continued his studies in psychology before moving to New Hampshire for three years when Balcomb was hired by Dartmouth.  After his tenure at the university, Balcomb recognized his true passion was painting and in 1931 he went to Paris to study at the Academie de la Grande Chaumière.  During this time, Gertrude was committed to her work as a sculptor and was inspired by abstract movements such as Constructivism and Neo-plasticism.

    Both artists produced and championed abstract art in their artistic output as well as through activism, particularly during the 1930s.  Gertrude continued her three-dimensional work through the 1930s to the mid-1940s before pivoting to painting for the remainder of her career.  Balcomb focused on non-objective art through the 1940s before reintroducing the figure into his work later in his career.  They were founding members of the American Abstract Artists group when it was formed in 1937.  Gertrude was its first paid employee, working the desk at the Squibb Gallery exhibition in 1937 (the organization’s first yearly show), and Balcomb was its first chairman.  Its mission was to gain acceptance of abstract art within the mainstream artistic communities.  In addition to its group exhibitions, the Greenes along with other members took a more active approach and routinely picketed art museums that did not feature abstract art.

  title: TURKU TRAJAN
  author: ''
  body: Trajan was born in Hungary and moved to New York at age 21, where he remained
    for his entire career.  Though he earned his living as a cook and baker, his passion
    was for art, and he pursued both painting and sculpture actively.  He had his
    first solo exhibition in 1944 in New York and was exhibited frequently at Zabriskie
    Gallery.  His richly-colored, thickly-impastoed oils show the influence of Post
    Impressionist movements including Fauvism and Expressionism.  Despite having little
    commercial success throughout his career, Trajan's work was supported fervently
    by Virginia Zabriskie, going against popular currents as she frequently did, and
    he thereby became an important influence on the new generation of New York abstract
    artists.

  title: ARNOLD FRIEDMAN
  author: ''
  body: Friedman was born in Corona, Queens and worked at the post office while painting
    on the weekends and in the evenings.  While maintaining his full-time job to support
    his family, he developed his art career, first taking classes at the Art Students
    League in 1905 under Robert Henri (1865-1929) and Kenneth Hayes Miller (1876-1952)
    and then, in 1909, taking a leave of absence from his job to go to Paris where
    he was introduced to Impressionism and burgeoning modern art movements such as
    Cubism.  His style evolved throughout his career, but he maintained his focus
    on color and nature, paying tribute to Impressionism, particularly Camille Pissarro (1820-1903).  He
    did not dedicate himself full-time to art until 1933 when he was 59 years old.

  title: EMILE BRANCHARD
  author: ''
  body: Branchard was born in Greenwich Village and lived in a boarding house in the
    area that was run by his mother and catered to artists.  Before becoming an artist,
    he worked as a stevedore, truck driver, and policeman on the Home Defense Fund
    during World War I.  He contracted tuberculosis early in his career, and confined
    to his home for long periods, began to paint.  A self-taught artist, his only
    exposure to art had been during his childhood when he used to watch his stepfather
    paint.  A fellow boarder saw Branchard's work and helped get his paintings into
    the “Society of Independent Artists Exhibition” of 1919 where they were appreciated
    by the critic and art dealer Stephan Bourgeois.  This led to further exhibitions,
    including at the Marie Harriman Gallery and The MoMA’s “Masters of Popular Painting”
    show in 1938.  His style, marked by flat forms with subtle, undulating contours,
    recalls Symbolist abstraction and the Precisionist artists working in New York
    during the 1920s and 1930s.

  title: 'KATHERINE SHUBERT-KUNIYOSHI SCHMIDT '
  author: ''
  body: Schmidt began her training at the Art Students League in New York, where she
    met her husband Yasuo Kuniyoshi (1889-1953).  Throughout the 1920s, she received
    critical praise for her still lifes, landscapes and portrayals of New York urban
    life, exhibiting frequently at prominent, modern New York galleries such as the
    Downtown Gallery, the Daniel Gallery and the Whitney Studio Club (of which she
    was a founding member and where she had her first solo exhibition in 1923).  She
    became dissatisfied with her work from around 1939 until 1960, producing less
    though still participating in group exhibitions, when a crumpled paper towel on
    a table inspired her to explore the motif of dead leaves and discarded paper,
    the style of which approached "magical realism."  She is known for her impeccable
    technique and her elevation of everyday, overlooked subjects.

  title: JOHN GRAHAM
  author: ''
  body: |-
    Graham’s significant, influential career of four decades was marked by reinvention and a commitment to his vision of the endless possibilities of American Art.

    Born Ivan Dabrowsky in Kiev, Graham was a law student and a czarist soldier in the 1917 revolution.  After imprisonment and the downfall of Nicholas II, Graham left Russia and arrived in the United States in 1920.  Though it is unclear if he showed artistic inclination in Russia, Graham recreated himself as an art student in New York.  He attended the Art Students League from 1922 to 1924, where he studied under John Sloan (1871-1951).  In a meteoric rise to recognition, Graham’s first solo museum exhibition was organized by Duncan Philips in 1929.

    Like many early career artists, Graham traveled to Paris (his work would later be exhibited at Galerie Zabriskie, Paris) and he came under the influence of the Surrealists and their psychoanalytical approach, however he remained dedicated to his mission of creating a new American Art.  Along with Stuart Davis (1892-1964) and Arshile Gorky (1904-1948), Graham would provide a foundation for American Modernism and would be sought out by a new generation of the New York School (his watershed 1937 treatise, _System and Dialectics of Art_ had advanced the Abstract Expressionist movement).

    During the 1940s, Graham departed from his post-Cubist style, and adopted a new loosened, abstract style.  At this time, he served as a mentor to younger artists such as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Arshile Gorky, whose works would shape the Abstract Expressionist movement.  Graham was also considered influential to Lee Krasner, David Smith, Dorothy Dehner, and Mark Rothko.

    In his mature career, he found inspiration in Old Master works and he approached his canvases with a measure of dignity and mysticism.  His portraits are powerful, standing out boldly from their flattened back drops.  Simultaneously, Graham conveyed a delicate luminosity and vulnerability; his sitters’ askew eyes act to ground the figure in a plane between fantasy and reality.  This merging of worlds characterizes not only Graham’s work but also his storied, monumental life.

  title: JOSEPH STELLA  AND COLLAGE
  author: ''
  body: |-
    Stella completed more than sixty-five collages during his career, using items like dirty paper, cigarette wrappers, theater tickets and leaves, all tremendously _avant-garde_ for their time.  They highlight each element’s tactility in a relatively unaltered state by the artist, allowing their natural decomposition and decay to show.  They were not exhibited during Stella's lifetime, and he spoke and wrote very little of them.  Not until a selection was first exhibited at the Zabriskie Gallery in 1960-61 were they brought to the attention of the broader artistic community. The following year, Zabriskie Gallery lent two collage works by Stella for "The Art of Assemblage" travelling exhibition organized by the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

    During his lifetime, Stella was primarily known for his Futurist works as well as his interest in Precisionism in the 1920s and 1930s.  He started making these intimate, experimental and personal collages around 1918 and likely continued throughout his career.  Joann Moser, in writing about Stella’s collages, has noted that they “. . . anticipated some of the more important developments in the medium over the past fifty years and represent some of the more significant and innovative achievements of his entire career (“The Collages of Joseph Stella: ‘Macchie/Macchine Naturali’,” American Art, Summer 1992, vol. 6, no. 3).

  title: ABRAHAM WALKOWITZ
  author: ''
  body: "Walkowitz was born in Tyumen, Sibera to Jewish parents and immigrated to
    the Lower East Side of New York with his mother in 1889.  He was trained in the
    academic style at the National Academy of Design, New York, and at the Académie
    Julian in Paris, though his style was most influenced by his experiences outside
    of the studio.  During his time in Paris from 1906-07, Walkowitz saw Isadora Duncan
    (1877-1927) dance at Auguste Rodin's (1840-1917) Paris studio and made his first
    drawings of her. He later recalled, \"She was a Muse. She had no laws. She didn't
    dance according to rules. She created. Her body was music. It was a body electric,
    like Walt Whitman.\" Like Duncan's dancing, Walkowitz's drawings and watercolors
    were created by quick and spontaneous lines and washes of color. In Paris, Walkowitz
    was also impressed by the landmark 1907 Paul Cézanne (1839-1906) retrospective
    exhibit at the _Salon d'Automne_ and by his introduction to the work of Henri
    Matisse (1869-1954) and Henri Rousseau (1844-1910).  By the time Walkowitz returned
    to New York, his style was heavily influenced by European Modernism, with emphasis
    on gestures, simplified forms and flat planes of bold color.  His first solo exhibition
    was held at Haas Gallery, the back of a modest frame shop, in New York in 1908.
    \n\nIn 1912, Walkowitz met Albert Stieglitz (1864-1946) through Marsden Hartley
    (1877-1943) and became involved with the 291 Gallery, New York, which served as
    a hub of American modernism. Stieglitz was so impressed by the young artist, that
    he sent him to study art in Greece, Italy and North Africa in 1914.  His style
    became more abstract; its reduced linear forms lent themselves to the city's rush
    skyward, prematurely anticipating the New York School and the Abstract Expressionists.
    \n\nIn 1913, Walkowitz was represented at the Armory Show and in the 1916 Forum
    exhibition.  Walkowitz was concerned with politics and artists' rights and was
    active in various artist's groups, founding the People's Art Guild and the Society
    of Independent Artists (he became director of the latter from 1918 to 1938).  In
    1920, he exhibited at the Société Anonyme alongside Man Ray (1890-1976), Hartley
    and Joseph Stella (1877-1946).  Despite local and international recognition, Walkowitz
    was not nearly as well-known as his contemporaries.  Virginia Zabriskie was among
    the many figures in the field, including Stieglitz, Henry McBride, Carl Van Vechten
    and Lloyd Goodrich, who thought that Walkowitz deserved more notice than he was
    given. \n\nWalkowitz painted into the 1940s, when his eyesight began to fail.
    \ Zabriskie represented him during the last six years of the artist's life.  She
    admired him for his work that was so archetypal of New York and for his passion
    and conviction.  Zabriskie Gallery held thirteen exhibitions of Walkowitz's work
    and placed him in the collections of major institutions.  In promoting his legacy,
    Zabriskie grew close to the aging artist, accompanying him to the Academy of Arts
    and Letters award ceremony in May 1962, where Walkowitz was given the Marjorie
    Peabody Waite Award for a distinguished elderly artist, to a standing ovation.
    \ After his death, Zabriskie purchased the Abraham Walkowitz Estate, including
    numerous watercolors and paintings left undiscovered in his studio.  Zabriskie
    organized Walkowitz's memorial service and remembered him as a devoted, often
    feisty artist whose work was not fully understood in his lifetime."

  title: 'THEODORE ROSZAK '
  author: ''
  body: Theodore Roszak was a Polish-born American artist who experimented in several
    mediums including photography, sculpture, painting, and print making throughout
    his career. During a fellowship in Prague, Roszak was introduced to the aesthetics
    and ideology of Constructivism. He explored the Constructivist movement mainly
    through three-dimensional structures created from plaster, metal, and wood. Roszak
    was first introduced to the practice of photography in the 1930s when he began
    photographing his sculptural work in the studio. Inspired by Moholy-Nagy, Roszak
    quickly began experimenting with photograms and incorporated his constructivist
    style into his photographic compositions. Virginia Zabriskie was drawn to artists
    who could successfully demonstrate the link between sculpture and photography
    and the similarity of their depiction of formal compositional elements. Zabriskie
    was an early supporter of Roszak's career and continued to work extensively with
    the Theodore Roszak Estate.

  title: FRANÇOIS KOLLAR
  author: ''
  body: François Kollar, a native of Hungary, established a gallery in Paris in 1930.  He
    began his career in advertising and fashion, photographing famous models and creating
    ads for iconic fashion lines, most notably in _Harper's Bazaar_.  His first model
    was his wife, who worked closely with him throughout his life.  Kollar, who had
    early experience working in factory and industrial settings, also became well-known
    as a master of industrial reportage. His imagery examined the changing nature
    of work during the transitional early 20th century, representing in expressive
    and modern compositions the changing landscape and the place of the individual.  All
    of Kollar's compositions demonstrate his deft treatment of light and texture,
    and feature numerous modern techniques, including abstracted lighting, superimosition,
    double exposures and solarization.

  title: LAURE ALBIN-GUILLOT
  author: ''
  body: Laure Albin-Guillot's work is not easily categorized. She produced well-known
    portraits of celebrities of her day, as well as modernist nudes, microphotography
    of fauna, still lifes, landscapes, and portfolios of work in tandem with noted
    French writers. Her visual approach is best characterized as semi-pictorialist,

    imagery in both beautiful and precise terms. She published and exhibited widely,
    and had the first one-person exhibition at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1925,
    which garnered her increasing attention and helped establish her reputation. Her
    fashion work appeared in _Vogue_ (the first in 1922), and other imagery was published
    in both _Vu_ and Arts & _Metiers Graphiques_ magazines. She was named president
    of the French Société des Artistes, among other key posts, and served as president
    of the Union féminine des carrières libérales et commerciales, an organization
    bent on supporting the interests of women in professional life.

  title: DADA AND SURREALISM
  author: ''
  body: |-
    Dada was an art movement that rode on a wave of anti-war sentiment and the existential crisis following World War I. It was officially called “Dada” in 1916 and applied to a group of _avant garde_ artists and intellectuals who were devoted to the abstract and having authentic emotional and spiritual experiences. According to Dadaists, authority and institutions stifled the full spectrum of human experience and needed to be re-examined. The intention of Dada, or Neo-Dada after 1945, was to shock or disorient the viewer and force them to question hierarchies, mainstream culture, and the hypocrisy of progress. Collage, assemblage, photography, film and “readymades” presented the paradoxes of creation and destruction and cross examined precious versus discarded materials.

    Neo-Dada was a contemporary movement to the early years of Zabriskie Gallery, which welcomed these ideas and provided a historical context through programming which allowed for comparisons between the artists of the 1950s and 60s with their post-World War I predecessors. Zabriskie Gallery, with New York as a backdrop, set a unique stage for works inspired by the _Dada Manifesto_ as the multifaceted, urban environment rejected stillness and uniformity. It is wholly appropriate that Zabriskie Gallery, which challenged the status quo with the spirit and tenacity of Virginia Zabriskie at the helm, would gravitate towards this zeitgeist. Zabriskie’s genuineness to her own independent ideas and aesthetic was a great part of the gallery’s success.

    Zabriskie Gallery would present several exhibitions that explored these ideas by featuring Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp’s “readymades”; assemblages by Joseph Cornell, Karl Mann, Alfonso Ossorio, Paule Vézelay, Maurice Henry, and Daniel Spoerri; collages by Joseph Stella, A.E. Gallatin, Bruce Connor, Eileen Agar, Balcomb and Gertrude Greene, and Ella Bergmann-Michel; and sculptures by Richard Stankiewicz and Wilfrid Zogbaum, among others.

    Through a succession of exhibitions, Virginia Zabriskie expanded the public’s knowledge of Dada and Surrealism as an integrated literary and artist movement. She was first made aware of Dada and Surrealist photographs through her interest in Man Ray’s work. As she expanded her understanding of this photography, she cleverly tracked down some other French photographers involved in the movement using the Parisian phonebook and added them to her roster. In 1985 after establishing strong relationships with both popular and lesser-known Dada and Surrealist artists in France, Galerie Zabriskie, Paris hosted an exhibit titled “Surrealist Photographs” which included the works of Hans Bellmer, Pierre Boucher, Brassaï, Georges Hugnet, André Kertész, François Kollar, Roger Parry, Man Ray, and others. Just one year later Zabriskie Gallery, New York held a major show titled “Surrealism 1936-Objects, Photographs, Collages and Documents” that furthered the understanding of Surrealism as a multidisciplinary school of thought and significantly widened the visibility of several French artists in America.

    Virginia Zabriskie’s groundbreaking contributions to the photography market stemmed from her distinctive sensibilities and audacious spirit. Beginning with a trove of Alfred Stieglitz photogravures she discovered, Zabriskie began to consider the ways in which photography was marketed and exhibited, and how growing commercial interest in the medium related to its classification as an art form. The result was both innovative exhibitions that juxtaposed and corresponded photography to other mediums and photo-centric shows that brought both historical and modern material to public in innovative and dynamic ways.

    Perhaps most interestingly, Zabriskie’s program established a connection between sculpture and photography, likening their sense of reality, depiction of three-dimensional space, and subject matter. One of her notable, early shows that included photography titled _Sculpture: A Photographer’s Vision,_ shown in 1977, paired Mary Frank with Jerry Thompson, Brancusi with Brancusi, Rodin with Steichen, and Gaston Lachaise with Paul Strand. The exhibition drew connections between form, line, space, and movement and helped establish the gallery as a serious authority in the medium of photography.

    In 1977, Zabriskie’s association with photography grew further significant with her opening of Galerie Zabriskie in Paris. At Galerie Zabriskie, Virginia endeavored to introduce photography as a significant art form to the European market. Due to the gallery’s low ceilings and small square footage, the space naturally lent itself to photographic exhibitions, and for the first few years of Galerie Zabriskie photographic shows were the only exhibitions mounted. Her attention to the conceptual and research aspects of the program promptly made Galerie Zabriskie one of the most important photography galleries in Europe at the time. The space became a Parisian sanctuary for individuals who were serious about practicing, curating, and collecting photography. The popular openings often attracted a crowd that would spill out onto the streets, and many principal minds of the medium had their first encounter at Galerie Zabriskie. Perhaps the most important consequence of those introductions was the melding of American and French photographers.

    One of Galerie Zabriskie’s goals was to introduce both contemporary and historical American photography to the French and vice versa. By the closing of Galerie Zabriskie in 1998, Virginia had introduced 26 American photographers to the European market by giving them their first international exhibition. Of those artists were historical names such as Berenice Abbott, Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander, Robert Frank, Walker Evans, Alfred Stieglitz, and more. Zabriskie performed the same exchange for French photographers in New York. Laure Albin-Guillot, Brassaï, Georges Hugnet, Claude Cahun, Francois Kollar, and more, all had their first American exposure at the Zabriskie Gallery. She was the first gallerist to exhibit Eugène Atget’s work in a commercial setting in France; the show paired Atget’s albumen prints of Paris with Berenice Abbott’s New York cityscapes. Zabriskie’s talent for research, impeccable curatorial skills, and a discerning eye lead to museum quality exhibitions that spurred new conversations and ideas across the Atlantic.

    Virginia Zabriskie changed the way we perceive and understand 20th-century photography. She introduced new photographers to the market, explored trans-Atlantic connections, and related the medium to a broader art historical cannon. With immense energy and care Virginia Zabriskie and her galleries played a major role in the expansion of the photography market and collector base.

  title: THE VIRGINIA ZABRISKIE COLLECTION
  body: |-
    ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dcryyrd42/image/upload/v1629999650/_MG_1005_yhkmlw.jpg)We are honored to offer the collection of Virginia Zabriskie in this special single-owner auction that opens our 2021 fall season. Virginia Zabriskie built her personal collection during a pioneering career that spanned more than five decades, marked by audacity and innovation in a field that was seldom encouraging to professional women.

    After acquiring her New York gallery in 1954, at the age of 26, Zabriskie inherited a promising roster of young artists, including Pat Adams, Clinton Hill and Lester Johnson, all well-represented in this auction. As a young art student, she had recognized her calling, musing later that, "My ability to interpret and criticize art grew faster than my ability to make it.

    ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dcryyrd42/image/upload/v1630001868/M44274-238_1_cyymip.jpg)Pursuing art history, she befriended the artist, critic and modern art promoter Walter Pach while she was a college student; through him, she met Marcel Duchamp, Edward Hopper and other contemporary artists in New York. This cemented her connoisseurship and faith in artists’ visions and informed her groundbreaking exhibitions, developed around the juxtaposition of media and historical eras. She is responsible for both launching the careers of artists and bringing forgotten, unappreciated artists to light. Zabriskie’s diverse program—a reflection of her unique curatorial vision and individual aesthetic—brought photography to the forefront at a time when the medium was still considered vanguard, and encompassed a wide range of work, from early 20th century Dada and Surrealist masters to American photography icons like William Klein and Harry Callahan.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dcryyrd42/image/upload/v1630000164/_MG_1019_mfku75.jpg)

    In 1966, the Zabriskie Gallery, which had been in a small space on the second floor of 835 Madison Avenue that had originally been established by Marvin Korman (a fellow graduate student at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University from whom she had acquired the gallery), relocated to 699 Madison Avenue, and after five years to 29 West 57th Street. By the early 1980s, Zabriskie Gallery had expanded into three spaces, two in New York, and one in Paris. The gallery at 724 Fifth Avenue specialized in painting; sculpture was highlighted at the 521 West 57th Street location. In addition to featuring contemporary and modernist American painters, Zabriskie's trailblazing programming included the exhibition of sculpture by Mary Frank, Saul Baizerman, George Rickey, Kenneth Snelson, Theodore Roszak and Richard Stankiewicz, among others.

    In 1977, Galerie Zabriskie opened in Paris at 29 rue Aubry le Boucher. It was the first gallery of its kind, joining an exhibition space for photographic works with a bookstore devoted to selling photo-related literature. Zabriskie not only presented individual American and French photographers, but also organized numerous landmark group shows which united these photographers from both sides of the Atlantic.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dcryyrd42/image/upload/v1630000130/_MG_1002_bkzlwh.jpg)

    She was a champion of 19th-century photographers such as Felice Beato, Edouard Baldus and Eadweard Muybridge, and extraordinarily held the first commercial exhibition in France of Eugene Atget's photographs of Paris (thanks in part to the photographer and Zabriskie Gallery artist Berenice Abbott, who had acquired Atget's negatives, through the studio of Man Ray and the art dealer Julien Levy, both of whom were also intrinsically linked to Zabriskie). Through this trans-Atlantic exchange, Zabriskie introduced many modern and contemporary European photographers to America, and brought American photography to Europe, creating a wider audience for Harry Callahan, Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Strand, Lee Friedlander, Brassaï, Man Ray, Berenice Abbott, Robert Frank and Nicholas Nixon, all artists included among this auction.

    Her full roster, most of whom appear in this auction, boasted a wide range of artists, including Abraham Walkowitz (Zabriskie held numerous exhibitions of his work and handled the artist's estate), Elie Nadelman, Alexander Archipenko, Marcel Duchamp, Joseph Stella, Ralston Crawford, Lucas Samaras, Nell Blaine, Milton Resnick, Ben Vautier, and many others.

    The Paris gallery closed in 1998 with "Au Revoir Paris," a group show highlighting all the American photographers whose first European exposure came at Galerie Zabriskie. In 1999 Virginia Zabriskie received the Médaille de la Ville de Paris, presented at the Hotel de Ville in Paris, for her significant contribution to French culture. Zabriskie continued to helm her New York gallery, at its last public exhibition space, in the Fuller Building on Madison Avenue, until its closing in December 2010. She continued to work as a private art dealer thereafter.

    ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dcryyrd42/image/upload/v1629999841/_MG_1018_mi5rgn.jpg)Though Zabriskie had said “to survive is to succeed," it is universally acknowledged that through her unwavering vision and determination, she left a legacy that has transformed our industry, both visually and professionally, which will persist for generations to come.
