  title: JOHN GRAHAM
  author: ''
  body: |-
    Graham’s significant, influential career of four decades was marked by reinvention and a commitment to his vision of the endless possibilities of American Art.

    Born Ivan Dabrowsky in Kiev, Graham was a law student and a czarist soldier in the 1917 revolution.  After imprisonment and the downfall of Nicholas II, Graham left Russia and arrived in the United States in 1920.  Though it is unclear if he showed artistic inclination in Russia, Graham recreated himself as an art student in New York.  He attended the Art Students League from 1922 to 1924, where he studied under John Sloan (1871-1951).  In a meteoric rise to recognition, Graham’s first solo museum exhibition was organized by Duncan Philips in 1929.

    Like many early career artists, Graham traveled to Paris (his work would later be exhibited at Galerie Zabriskie, Paris) and he came under the influence of the Surrealists and their psychoanalytical approach, however he remained dedicated to his mission of creating a new American Art.  Along with Stuart Davis (1892-1964) and Arshile Gorky (1904-1948), Graham would provide a foundation for American Modernism and would be sought out by a new generation of the New York School (his watershed 1937 treatise, _System and Dialectics of Art_ had advanced the Abstract Expressionist movement).

    During the 1940s, Graham departed from his post-Cubist style, and adopted a new loosened, abstract style.  At this time, he served as a mentor to younger artists such as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Arshile Gorky, whose works would shape the Abstract Expressionist movement.  Graham was also considered influential to Lee Krasner, David Smith, Dorothy Dehner, and Mark Rothko.

    In his mature career, he found inspiration in Old Master works and he approached his canvases with a measure of dignity and mysticism.  His portraits are powerful, standing out boldly from their flattened back drops.  Simultaneously, Graham conveyed a delicate luminosity and vulnerability; his courtesans’ askew eyes act to ground the figure in a plane between fantasy and reality.  This merging of worlds characterizes not only Graham’s work but also his storied, monumental life.

  title: JOSEPH STELLA & COLLAGE
  author: ''
  body: |-
    Stella completed more than sixty-five collages during his career, using items like dirty paper, cigarette wrappers, theater tickets and leaves, all tremendously _avant-garde_ for their time.  They highlight each element’s tactility in a relatively unaltered state by the artist, allowing their natural decomposition and decay to show.  They were not exhibited during Stella's lifetime, and he spoke and wrote very little of them.  Not until a selection was first exhibited at the Zabriskie Gallery in 1960-61 were they brought to the attention of the broader artistic community.

    During his lifetime, Stella was primarily known for his Futurist works as well as his interest in Precisionism in the 1920s and 1930s.  He started making these intimate, experimental and personal collages around 1918 and likely continued throughout his career.  Joann Moser, in writing about Stella’s collages, has noted that they “. . . anticipated some of the more important developments in the medium over the past fifty years and represent some of the more significant and innovative achievements of his entire career (“The Collages of Joseph Stella: ‘Macchie/Macchine Naturali’,” American Art, Summer 1992, vol. 6, no. 3).

  title: ABRAHAM WALKOWITZ
  author: ''
  body: "Walkowitz was born in Tyumen, Sibera to Jewish parents and immigrated to
    the Lower East Side of New York with his mother in 1889.  He was trained in the
    academic style at the National Academy of Design, New York, and at the Académie
    Julian in Paris, though his style was most influenced by his experiences outside
    of the studio.  During his time in Paris from 1906-07, Walkowitz saw Isadora Duncan
    (1877-1927) dance at Auguste Rodin's (1840-1917) Paris studio and made his first
    drawings of her. He later recalled, \"She was a Muse. She had no laws. She didn't
    dance according to rules. She created. Her body was music. It was a body electric,
    like Walt Whitman.\" Like Duncan's dancing, Walkowitz's drawings and watercolors
    were created by quick and spontaneous lines and washes of color. In Paris, Walkowitz
    was also impressed by the landmark 1907 Paul Cézanne (1839-1906) retrospective
    exhibit at the _Salon d'Automne_ and by his introduction to the work of Henri
    Matisse (1869-1954) and Henri Rousseau (1844-1910).  By the time Walkowitz returned
    to New York, his style was heavily influenced by European Modernism, with emphasis
    on gestures, simplified forms and flat planes of bold color.  His first solo exhibition
    was held at Haas Gallery, the back of a modest frame shop, in New York in 1908.
    \n\nIn 1912, Walkowitz met Albert Stieglitz (1864-1946) through Marsden Hartley
    (1877-1943) and became involved with the 291 Gallery, New York, which served as
    a hub of American modernism. Stieglitz was so impressed by the young artist, that
    he sent him to study art in Greece, Italy and North Africa in 1914.  His style
    became more abstract; its reduced linear forms lent themselves to the city's rush
    skyward, prematurely anticipating the New York School and the Abstract Expressionists.
    \n\nIn 1913, Walkowitz was represented at the Armory Show and in the 1916 Forum
    exhibition.  Walkowitz was concerned with politics and artists' rights and was
    active in various artist's groups, founding the People's Art Guild and the Society
    of Independent Artists (he became director of the latter from 1918 to 1938).  In
    1920, he exhibited at the Société Anonyme alongside Man Ray (1890-1976), Hartley
    and Joseph Stella (1877-1946).  Despite local and international recognition, Walkowitz
    was not nearly as well-known as his contemporaries.  Virginia Zabriskie was among
    the many figures in the field, including Stieglitz, Henry McBride, Carl Van Vechten
    and Lloyd Goodrich, who thought that Walkowitz deserved more notice than he was
    given. \n\nWalkowitz painted into the 1940s, when his eyesight began to fail.
    \ Zabriskie represented him during the last six years of the artist's life.  She
    admired him for his work that was so archetypal of New York and for his passion
    and conviction.  Zabriskie Gallery held thirteen exhibitions of Walkowitz's work
    and placed him in the collections of major institutions.  In promoting his legacy,
    Zabriskie grew close to the aging artist, accompanying him to the Academy of Arts
    and Letters award ceremony in May 1962, where Walkowitz was given the Marjorie
    Peabody Waite Award for a distinguished elderly artist, to a standing ovation.
    \ After his death, Zabriskie purchased the Abraham Walkowitz Estate, including
    numerous watercolors and paintings left undiscovered in his studio.  Zabriskie
    organized Walkowitz's memorial service and remembered him as a devoted, often
    feisty artist whose work was not fully understood in his lifetime."

  title: 'THEODORE ROSZAK '
  author: ''
  body: Theodore Roszak was a Polish-born American artist who experimented in several
    mediums including photography, sculpture, painting, and print making throughout
    his career. During a fellowship in Prague, Roszak was introduced to the aesthetics
    and ideology of Constructivism. He explored the Constructivist movement mainly
    through three-dimensional structures created from plaster, metal, and wood. Roszak
    was first introduced to the practice of photography in the 1930s when he began
    photographing his sculptural work in the studio. Inspired by Moholy-Nagy, Roszak
    quickly began experimenting with photograms and incorporated his constructivist
    style into his photographic compositions. Virginia Zabriskie was drawn to artists
    who could successfully demonstrate the link between sculpture and photography
    and the similarity of their depiction of formal compositional elements. Zabriskie
    was an early supporter of Roszak's career and continued to work extensively with
    the Theodore Roszak Estate.

  title: FRANÇOIS KOLLAR
  author: ''
  body: François Kollar, a native of Hungary, established a gallery in Paris in 1930.  He
    began his career in advertising and fashion, photographing famous models and creating
    ads for iconic fashion lines, most notably in _Harper's Bazaar_.  His first model
    was his wife, who worked closely with him throughout his life.  Kollar, who had
    early experience working in factory and industrial settings, also became well-known
    as a master of industrial reportage. His imagery examined the changing nature
    of work during the transitional early 20th century, representing in expressive
    and modern compositions the changing landscape and the place of the individual.  All
    of Kollar's compositions demonstrate his deft treatment of light and texture,
    and feature numerous modern techniques, including abstracted lighting, superimosition,
    double exposures and solarization.

  title: LAURE ALBIN-GUILLOT
  author: ''
  body: Laure Albin-Guillot's work is not easily categorized. She produced well-known
    portraits of celebrities of her day, as well as modernist nudes, microphotography
    of fauna, still lifes, landscapes, and portfolios of work in tandem with noted
    French writers. Her visual approach is best characterized as semi-pictorialist,
    with soft, luxurious values and a quiet gaze, her technical skill rendering the
    imagery in both beautiful and precise terms. She published and exhibited widely,
    and had the first one-person exhibition at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1925,
    which garnered her increasing attention and helped establish her reputation. Her
    fashion work appeared in _Vogue_ (the first in 1922), and other imagery was published
    in both _Vu_ and Arts & _Metiers Graphiques_ magazines. She was named president
    of the French Société des Artistes, among other key posts, and served as president
    of the Union féminine des carrières libérales et commerciales, an organization
    bent on supporting the interests of women in professional life.

  title: SURREALISM
  author: ''
  body: Through a succession of exhibitions, Virginia Zabriskie expanded the public’s
    knowledge of Surrealism as an integrated literary and artist movement. She was
    first made aware of Surrealist photographs through her interest in Man Ray’s work.
    As she expanded her apprehension of Surrealist photography, she tracked down French
    photographers involved in the movement using the Parisian phonebook. In 1985 after
    establishing strong relationships with both known and unknown Surrealist artists
    in France, Galerie Zabriskie, Paris hosted an exhibit titled “Surrealist Photographs”
    which included the works of Hans Bellmer, Pierre Boucher, Brassaï, George Hugnet,
    André Kertész, François Kollar, Roger Parry, Man Ray, and others. Just one year
    later Gallery Zabriskie, New York held a major show titled “Surrealism 1936-Objects,
    Photographs, Collages and Documents” that furthered the understanding of Surrealism
    as a multidisciplinary school of thought and widened several French artists’ markets
    in America.

  title: VIRGINIA ZABRISKIE AND PHOTOGRAPHY

    Virginia Zabriskie’s groundbreaking contributions to the photography market stemmed from her distinctive sensibilities and audacious spirit. Beginning with a trove of Alfred Stieglitz photogravures she discovered, Zabriskie began to consider the ways in which photography was marketed and exhibited, and how growing commercial interest in the medium related to its classification as an art form. The result was both innovative exhibitions that juxtaposed and corresponded photography to other mediums and photo-centric shows that brought both historical and modern material to public in innovative and dynamic ways.

    Perhaps most interestingly, Zabriskie’s program established a connection between sculpture and photography, likening their sense of reality, depiction of three-dimensional space, and subject matter. One of her notable, early shows that included photography titled _Sculpture: A Photographer’s Vision,_ shown in 1977, paired Mary Frank with Jerry Thompson, Brancusi with Brancusi, Rodin with Steichen, and Gaston Lachaise with Paul Strand. The exhibition drew connections between form, line, space, and movement and helped establish the gallery as a serious authority in the medium of photography.

    In 1977, Zabriskie’s association with photography grew more serious when she was given the opportunity to open a gallery in Paris. With the opening of Galerie Zabriskie, Virginia endeavored to introduce photography as a significant art form to the European market. Due to the gallery’s low ceilings and small square footage, the space naturally lent itself to photographic exhibitions, and for the first few years of Galerie Zabriskie photographic shows were the only mounted. Her attention to the conceptual and research aspects of the program promptly made Galerie Zabriskie one of the most important photography galleries in Europe at the time. The space became a Parisian sanctuary for individuals who were serious about practicing, curating, and collecting photography. The openings often attracted a crowd that would spill out onto the streets, and many principal minds of the medium had their first encounter at Galerie Zabriskie. Perhaps the most important consequence of those introductions was the melding of American and French photographers.

    One of Galerie Zabriskie’s goals was to introduce both contemporary and historical American photography to the French and vice versa. By the closing of Galerie Zabriskie in 1998, Virginia had introduced 26 American photographers to the European market by giving them their first international exhibition. Of those artists were historical names such as Berenice Abbott, Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander, Robert Frank, Walker Evans, Alfred Stieglitz, and more. She performed the same service for French photographers in New York. Laure Albin-Guillot, Brassaï, Georges Hugnet, Claude Cahun, Francois Kollar, and more, all had their first American exposure at the Zabriskie Gallery. She was the first gallerist to exhibit Eugène Atget’s work in a commercial setting in France; the show paired Atget’s albumen prints of Paris to Berenice Abbott’s New York cityscapes. Zabriskie’s knack for research, strong curatorial skills, and discerning eye lead to museum quality exhibitions that spurred new conversations and ideas across the Atlantic.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dcryyrd42/image/upload/v1630000246/_MG_0996_clgxxf.jpg)

    Virginia Zabriskie changed the way we perceive and understand 20th-century photography. She introduced new photographers to the market, explored trans-Atlantic connections, and related the medium to a broader art historical cannon. With immense energy and care Virginia Zabriskie and her establishments played a major role in the expansion of the photography market and collector base.

  title: THE VIRGINIA ZABRISKIE COLLECTION
  body: |-
    ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dcryyrd42/image/upload/v1629999650/_MG_1005_yhkmlw.jpg)We are honored to offer the collection of Virginia Zabriskie in this special single-owner auction that opens our 2021 fall season. Virginia Zabriskie built her personal collection during a pioneering career that spanned more than five decades, marked by audacity and innovation in a field that was seldom encouraging to professional women.

    After acquiring her New York gallery in 1954, at the age of 26, Zabriskie inherited a promising roster of young artists, including Pat Adams, Clinton Hill and Lester Johnson, all well-represented in this auction. As a young art student, she had recognized her calling, musing later that, "My ability to interpret and criticize art grew faster than my ability to make it.

    ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dcryyrd42/image/upload/v1630001868/M44274-238_1_cyymip.jpg)Pursuing art history, she befriended the artist, critic and modern art promoter Walter Pach while she was a college student; through him, she met Marcel Duchamp, Edward Hopper and other contemporary artists in New York. This cemented her connoisseurship and faith in artists’ visions and informed her groundbreaking exhibitions, developed around the juxtaposition of media and historical eras. She is responsible for both launching the careers of artists and bringing forgotten, unappreciated artists to light. Zabriskie’s diverse program—a reflection of her unique curatorial vision and individual aesthetic—brought photography to the forefront at a time when the medium was still considered vanguard, and encompassed a wide range of work, from early 20th century Dada and Surrealist masters to American photography icons like William Klein and Harry Callahan.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dcryyrd42/image/upload/v1630000164/_MG_1019_mfku75.jpg)

    In 1966, the Zabriskie Gallery, which had been in a small space on the second floor of 835 Madison Avenue that had originally been established by Marvin Korman (a fellow graduate student at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University from whom she had acquired the gallery), relocated to 699 Madison Avenue, and after five years to 29 West 57th Street. By the early 1980s, Zabriskie Gallery had expanded into three spaces, two in New York, and one in Paris. The gallery at 724 Fifth Avenue specialized in painting; sculpture was highlighted at the 521 West 57th Street location. In addition to featuring contemporary and modernist American painters, Zabriskie's trailblazing programming included the exhibition of sculpture by Mary Frank, Saul Baizerman, George Rickey, Kenneth Snelson, Theodore Roszak and Richard Stankiewicz, among others.

    In 1977, Galerie Zabriskie opened in Paris at 29 rue Aubry le Boucher. It was the first gallery of its kind, joining an exhibition space for photographic works with a bookstore devoted to selling photo-related literature. Zabriskie not only presented individual American and French photographers, but also organized numerous landmark group shows which united these photographers from both sides of the Atlantic.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dcryyrd42/image/upload/v1630000130/_MG_1002_bkzlwh.jpg)

    She was a champion of 19th-century photographers such as Felice Beato, Edouard Baldus and Eadweard Muybridge, and extraordinarily held the first commercial exhibition in France of Eugene Atget's photographs of Paris (thanks in part to the photographer and Zabriskie Gallery artist Berenice Abbott, who had acquired Atget's negatives, through the studio of Man Ray and the art dealer Julien Levy, both of whom were also intrinsically linked to Zabriskie). Through this trans-Atlantic exchange, Zabriskie introduced many modern and contemporary European photographers to America, and brought American photography to Europe, creating a wider audience for Harry Callahan, Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Strand, Lee Friedlander, Brassaï, Man Ray, Berenice Abbott, Robert Frank and Nicholas Nixon, all artists included among this auction.

    Her full roster, all of whom appear in this auction, boasted a wide range of artists, including Abraham Walkowitz (Zabriskie held numerous exhibitions of his work and handled the artist's estate), Elie Nadelman, Alexander Archipenko, Marcel Duchamp, Joseph Stella, Ralston Crawford, Lucas Samaras, Nell Blaine, Milton Resnick, Ben Vautier, and many others.

    The Paris gallery closed in 1998 with "Au Revoir Paris," a group show highlighting all the American photographers whose first European exposure came at Galerie Zabriskie. In 1999 Virginia Zabriskie received the Médaille de la Ville de Paris, presented at the Hotel de Ville in Paris, for her significant contribution to French culture. Zabriskie continued to helm her New York gallery, at its last public exhibition space, in the Fuller Building on Madison Avenue, until its closing in December 2010. She continued to work as a private art dealer thereafter.

    ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dcryyrd42/image/upload/v1629999841/_MG_1018_mi5rgn.jpg)Though Zabriskie had said “to survive is to succeed," it is universally acknowledged that through her unwavering vision and determination, she left a legacy that has transformed our industry, both visually and professionally, which will persist for generations to come.
