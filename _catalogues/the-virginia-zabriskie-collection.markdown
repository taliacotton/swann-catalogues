  title: THE VIRGINIA ZABRISKIE COLLECTION
  body: "We are honored to offer the collection of Virginia Zabriskie in this special
    single-owner auction that opens our 2021 fall season. Virginia Zabriskie built
    her personal collection during a pioneering career that spanned more than five
    decades, marked by audacity and innovation in a field that was seldom encouraging
    to professional women.\n\nAfter acquiring her New York gallery in 1954, at the
    age of 26, Zabriskie inherited a promising roster of young artists, including
    Pat Adams, Clinton Hill and Lester Johnson, all well-represented in this auction.
    As a young art student, she had recognized her calling, musing later that, \"My
    ability to interpret and criticize art grew faster than my ability to make it.\"
    Pursuing art history, she befriended the artist, critic and modern art promoter
    Walter Pach while she was a college student; through him, she met Marcel Duchamp,
    Edward Hopper and other contemporary artists in New York. This cemented her connoisseurship
    and faith in artists’ visions and informed her groundbreaking exhibitions, developed
    around the juxtaposition of media and historical eras. She is responsible for
    both launching the careers of artists and bringing forgotten, unappreciated artists
    to light. Zabriskie’s diverse program—a reflection of her unique curatorial vision
    and individual aesthetic—brought photography to the forefront at a time when the
    medium was still considered vanguard, and encompassed a wide range of work, from
    early 20th century Dada and Surrealist masters to American photography icons like
    William Klein and Harry Callahan.\n\nIn 1966, the Zabriskie Gallery, which had
    been in a small space on the second floor of 835 Madison Avenue that had originally
    been established by Marvin Korman (a fellow graduate student at the Institute
    of Fine Arts at New York University from whom she had acquired the gallery), relocated
    to 699 Madison Avenue, and after five years to 29 West 57th Street. By the early
    1980s, Zabriskie Gallery had expanded into three spaces, two in New York, and
    one in Paris. The gallery at 724 Fifth Avenue specialized in painting; sculpture
    was highlighted at the 521 West 57th Street location. In addition to featuring
    contemporary and modernist American painters, Zabriskie's trailblazing programming
    included the exhibition of sculpture by Mary Frank, Saul Baizerman, George Rickey,
    Kenneth Snelson, Theodore Roszak and Richard Stankiewicz, among others.   \n   \n
    In 1977, Galerie Zabriskie opened in Paris at 29 rue Aubry le Boucher. It was
    the first gallery of its kind, joining an exhibition space for photographic works
    with a bookstore devoted to selling photo-related literature. Zabriskie not only
    presented individual American and French photographers, but also organized numerous
    landmark group shows which united these photographers from both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nShe
    was a champion of 19th-century photographers such as Felice Beato, Edouard Baldus
    and Eadweard Muybridge, and extraordinarily held the first commercial exhibition
    in France of Eugene Atget's photographs of Paris (thanks in part to the photographer
    and Zabriskie Gallery artist Berenice Abbott, who had acquired Atget's negatives,
    through the studio of Man Ray and the art dealer Julien Levy, both of whom were
    also intrinsically linked to Zabriskie). Through this trans-Atlantic exchange,
    Zabriskie introduced many modern and contemporary European photographers to America,
    and brought American photography to Europe, creating a wider audience for Harry
    Callahan, Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Strand, Lee Friedlander, Brassaï, Man Ray, Berenice
    Abbott, Robert Frank and Nicholas Nixon, all artists included among this auction.\n\nHer
    full roster, all of whom appear in this auction, boasted a wide range of artists,
    including Abraham Walkowitz (Zabriskie held numerous exhibitions of his work and
    handled the artist's estate), Elie Nadelman, Alexander Archipenko, Marcel Duchamp,
    Joseph Stella, Ralston Crawford, Lucas Samaras, Nell Blaine, Milton Resnick, Ben
    Vautier, and many others.\n\nThe Paris gallery closed in 1998 with \"Au Revoir
    Paris,\" a group show highlighting all the American photographers whose first
    European exposure came at Galerie Zabriskie. In 1999 Virginia Zabriskie received
    the Médaille de la Ville de Paris, presented at the Hotel de Ville in Paris, for
    her significant contribution to French culture. Zabriskie continued to helm her
    New York gallery, at its last public exhibition space, in the Fuller Building
    on Madison Avenue, until its closing in December 2010. She continued to work as
    a private art dealer thereafter.\n\nThough Zabriskie had said “to survive is to
    succeed,\" it is universally acknowledged that through her unwavering vision and
    determination, she left a legacy that has transformed our industry, both visually
    and professionally, which will persist for generations to come."
