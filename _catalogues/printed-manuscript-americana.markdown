- lot: 122
  title: Printed & Manuscript Americana (various consignors)
  author: ''
  body: 'We now continue with our regularly scheduled Americana programming, lots
    122-349: Americana from a variety of consignors, spanning the 17th through 20th
    centuries, including books, broadsides, manuscripts, archives, photographs, prints,
    original art, and even a sculpture. This will be followed by a selection of Latin
    Americana (lots 350-388) which extends back as far as 1566.'
- lot: 101
  title: ''
  author: ''
  body: Closing out this noteworthy print collection are lots 101 through 121, relating
    broadly to the rapidly expanding commerce and westward exploration of the young
    nation, covering American Indians, the Mexican War, Perry's arrival in Japan,
    the whaling industry, and a lone Civil War print, described as "an enduring image
    of the Lost Cause."

  body: The War of 1812 is covered in lots 86 through 100, with naval battles a particular
    strength.
- lot: 72
  title: ''
  author: ''
  body: As seen in lots 72 through 80, the birth of the United States required a seismic
    shift in world view on both sides of the Atlantic. Printmakers tried to make sense
    of this shift using symbols and allegories--often by elevating America to the
    status of one of the four great continents (apologies to South America, Australia,
    and Antarctica). These are followed by four examples of the early American engraving
    craft including Amos Doolittle's famous Prodigal Son series from 1814.
- lot: 38
  title: ''
  author: ''
  body: Lot 38 through 63 all depict George Washington and related scenes, including
    three of the first printed portraits ever produced (apparently from the active
    imagination of engravers), a fascinating variety of more reliable portraits, and
    several poignant memorial prints. These are followed by portraits of other founding
    fathers--Hancock, Lee, Franklin, Hamilton, Lafayette, and Jefferson through lot
    71.
- lot: 14
  title: ''
  author: ''
  body: Lots 14 through 37 tell the story of the American Revolution, from three depictions
    of the Boston Massacre, the opening salvos of Lexington and Bunkers Hill, the
    victory of John Paul Jones at Flamborough Head, through the British surrender
    at Yorktown.

    We begin this auction with a noteworthy collection of historical prints which spins a narrative of America stretching from the arrival of Columbus to the start of the Civil War. This collection was compiled over the past three decades by a Virginia gentleman, buying mostly from the leading dealers and auction houses in the field.

    Here you can find famed rarities such as the 1776 London engraving of the Romans view of Bunker Hill (lot 22, only one seen at auction since 1973); unknown gems such as the Battle of Buena Vista lithographed by Frances Palmer (lot 106, none traced in OCLC); beautiful copies of old favorites including the southeast and southwest views of Manhattan from the 1768 Scenographia Americana series (lots 6 and 7); at least one previously unknown item, a circa 1832 printing of the Constitution featuring a portrait of Washington (lot 60); and a few bargains to catch the attention of all ranks of collectors.

    Dramatic battle scenes (land and sea) alternate with portraiture of the founding fathers, city views, and a thought-provoking section of allegorical prints which reflect on independent America's new place in the world after the Revolution. A small selection of important illustrated books and pamphlets on the Revolution (lots 15, 25, 26, and 40) complements the mezzotints, etchings, lithographs, and copper engravings.

    The collection begins with 13 prints representing the colonial era, including city views and scenes from the French and Indian War, lots 1 to 13.
