  body: Focus on Women includes material created by women who are household names,
    and others whose stories have been almost entirely forgotten. In the course of
    selecting and cataloging material for the sale, the truths of many women's struggles
    and accomplishments—both mundane and record-making—manifested in several ways,
    with a core of interlocking patterns. Piecing together the untold stories required
    research guided by trails of breadcrumbs left by the objects themselves. We at
    Swann hope that our audience of scholars, collectors, and institutions will enjoy
    the early printed books, manuscripts, fine bindings, photographs, prints, drawings,
    and archives we have assembled to celebrate and highlight the contributions of
    women.
