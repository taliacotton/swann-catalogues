  body: Founded by Nathaniel Currier in 1835, Currier & Ives was the major poster
    firm of the nineteenth century. James Merritt Ives joined Currier in 1857, and
    the two produced some of the most popular images of the period through 1907â€”with
    the bulk of their work being done in the 1860s. Together they published thousands
    of prints, in three folio sizes (small, medium and large) of scenes that are still
    sought by collectors today.
