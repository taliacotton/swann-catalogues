  title: Imogen Cunningham
  author: ''
  body: "Cunningham's _Shell Collection 3_ features an array of textures and values,
    including detail-rich dark grays and blacks and luminous, glittering highlights.
    Cunningham's approach in this elegant still life is emblematic of the modernist
    aesthetic that she is known for and championed, and also a work that hints at
    abundance, one that is evocatively sensual. This duality characterizes much of
    her work.\n\nCunningham's earliest photography was Pictorialist in nature, but
    after a 1923 meeting with Edward Weston, she began to favor a modernist approach.
    Her flora and fauna studies of the 1920s and 30s are often associated with this
    shift. These distinctly rendered, close up, elemental, and lush renderings of
    plant life were first shown in the landmark Film und Foto exhibit in Stuttgart
    in 1929. By 1932 she would be a charter member of the West Coast Group f.64, whose
    members favored sharp, unfiltered, and unmanipulated imagery. Their direct, or
    \"straight,\" photographic approach eschewed compositional manipulation in favor
    of recording, and certainly this influence can be seen in _Shell Collection_.\n\nHowever,
    Cunningham explored other photographic styles and subjects throughout her long
    career. \"I photograph anything that can be exposed to light,\" she said, and
    indeed here her apparent desire to look closely from all angles and translate
    to photographic paper form, light, and shape, hints at an emotional appreciation
    for form and abstraction.\n\n> _\"The formula for doing a good job in photography
    is to think like a poet.\"_  \n> Imogen Cunningham"
