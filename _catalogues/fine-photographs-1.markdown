  title: Peter Beard
  author: ''
  body: "Peter Beard was a photographer well-known for his pictures of Africans and
    African wildlife. He made his first trip to the continent when he was 17, photographing
    with a VoigtlÃ¤nder camera his grandmother had given him. In 2013 Beard wrote to
    Robert Kolker, a journalist for _New York Magazine_, \"I made a life for myself
    in Africa that was as far as you could possibly get from art school at Yale.\"
    \n\nIn the 1960s, concurrent with a project about the demise of starving elephants
    and black rhinos, Beard began creating elaborate, large format photo-collage \"diaries\"
    (hardly an unheard of project for Beard; he had been making diaries with collaged
    imagery since the age of 12). The \"diaries\" incorporated everything from postage
    stamps to news clippings to smears of animal blood. He purchased Hog Ranch, an
    encampment outside of Nairobi, in the mid-60s. In the following decades, his work
    focused on documenting the Kenyan environment, its people, wildlife and landscape,
    as well as conservation and man's impact on nature. From the 1970s until his passing
    in 2020, Beard split his time between Hog Ranch and his home in Montauk. \n\nThis
    photograph, entitled _Cheetah Orphans in Mweiga near Nyeri_, is one of Beard's
    most iconic images, a poignant and impactful depiction of two orphaned cheetah
    cubs. Though this image is the basis for other works, each piece is entirely unique,
    as each photograph is treated as a district canvas upon which Beard has added
    his drawings, collages, and/or handwritten text."

  title: Roy DeCarava
  author: ''
  body: "Born in Harlem in 1919, Roy DeCarava began his formal artist career studying
    painting at The Cooper Union Institute, then painting and printmaking at the Harlem
    Community Arts Center, and subsequently drawing and painting under Charles White.
    He picked up a camera with the intention of documenting his printmaking progress,
    and it became his sole artistic focus in the 1940s. He brought an attuned sense
    of composition and tonal sophistication to the photographic medium. \n\nDeCarava's
    key subjects of interests are the streets, the home, and jazz. Instead of taking
    a purely documentary approach to photographing everyday Harlem life, he sought
    to personally understand, capture, and elevate the varied textures and soul of
    his neighborhood. DeCarava said of his work, \"It's not the subject that interests
    me as much as my perception of the subject.\" \n\nAn innovative and skilled darkroom
    technician, DeCarava's prints are known for their darkness. He started printing
    in a shadowy, murky tonal range in the early 1950s, and the stylistic choice was
    further encouraged by the New York jazz scene. The result is alluring and mysterious
    photographs, that reveal meaning in layers of gray. \n\nThe early classic still
    life _Catsup Bottles, Table and Coat, New York_, was taken in 1952 and exemplifies
    DeCarava's ability to render intimate, expressive qualities in form and tone.
    The balanced composition of light and shadow produces a subtle gradation that
    never quite deliveries a pure white. When considered carefully DeCarava's images
    disclose themes of social, cultural, and historical significance in their complex
    tonality."

  title: Robert Frank
  author: ''
  body: "Robert Frank, a photographer who is indelibly associated with the inequity,
    grit, beauty, and paradox of the American social landscape, included a number
    of images featuring cars in his seminal photo book _The Americans_. In his vision,
    Americans are on the road together, alone, for pleasure, out of necessity, sometimes
    in gleaming autos, sometimes a blur of speed and joy, sometimes a means of endured
    transport, sometimes a means of finding connection with others, sometimes a means
    of displaying and establishing identity. Memorably, the last image in the volume
    features Frank's family huddled in a car (_U.S. 90, en route to Del Rio, Texas_),
    a marker of his own cross-country road trip to make images, and his own relationship
    with an automobile. \n\n_Covered Car, Long Beach, California_ features an automobile
    shrouded and situated under two looming palm trees, its form made distinct and
    hard in the California light, is the most iconic. The folds of the cover offer
    an elegant visual counterweight to the rest of the composition, the draping lines
    and the gleaming textile subtly suggesting their own sensuality. The image seemingly
    speaks to 1950s economic comfort and to the glamorous (if mysterious) California
    lifestyle, while simultaneously offering a sly commentary on our national obsession
    with cars.\n\nJack Kerouac, in his iconic introduction to _The Americans_, comments
    on this photograph: \"Car shrouded in fancy expensive designed tarpolian to keep
    soots of no-soot Malibu from falling on new simonize job as owner who is two-dollar-an-hour
    carpenter snoozes in house with wife, and TV, all under palm trees for nothing,
    in the cemeterial California night.\""

  title: Imogen Cunningham
  author: ''
  body: "Cunningham's _Shell Collection 3_ features an array of textures and values,
    including detail-rich dark grays and blacks and luminous, glittering highlights.
    Cunningham's approach in this elegant still life is emblematic of the modernist
    aesthetic that she is known for and championed, and also a work that hints at
    abundance, one that is evocatively sensual. This duality characterizes much of
    her work.\n\nCunningham's earliest photography was Pictorialist in nature, but
    after a 1923 meeting with Edward Weston, she began to favor a modernist approach.
    Her flora and fauna studies of the 1920s and 30s are often associated with this
    shift. These distinctly rendered, close up, elemental, and lush renderings of
    plant life were first shown in the landmark Film und Foto exhibit in Stuttgart
    in 1929. By 1932 she would be a charter member of the West Coast Group f.64, whose
    members favored sharp, unfiltered, and unmanipulated imagery. Their direct, or
    \"straight,\" photographic approach eschewed compositional manipulation in favor
    of recording, and certainly this influence can be seen in _Shell Collection_.\n\nHowever,
    Cunningham explored other photographic styles and subjects throughout her long
    career. \"I photograph anything that can be exposed to light,\" she said, and
    indeed here her apparent desire to look closely from all angles and translate
    to photographic paper form, light, and shape, hints at an emotional appreciation
    for form and abstraction.\n\n> _\"The formula for doing a good job in photography
    is to think like a poet.\"_  \n> Imogen Cunningham"
