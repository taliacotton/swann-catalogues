  title: Robert Frank
  author: ''
  body: "Robert Frank, a photographer who is indelibly associated with the inequity,
    grit, beauty, and paradox of the American social landscape, included a number
    of images featuring cars in his seminal photo book _The Americans_. In his vision,
    Americans are on the road together, alone, for pleasure, out of necessity, sometimes
    in gleaming autos, sometimes a blur of speed and joy, sometimes a means of endured
    transport, sometimes a means of finding connection with others, sometimes a means
    of displaying and establishing identity. Memorably, the last image in the volume
    features Frank's family huddled in a car (_U.S. 90, en route to Del Rio, Texas_),
    a marker of his own cross-country road trip to make images, and his own relationship
    with an automobile. \n\n_Covered Car, Long Beach, California_ features an automobile
    shrouded and situated under two looming palm trees, its form made distinct and
    hard in the California light, is the most iconic. The folds of the cover offer
    an elegant visual counterweight to the rest of the composition, the draping lines
    and the gleaming textile subtly suggesting their own sensuality. The image seemingly
    speaks to 1950s economic comfort and to the glamorous (if mysterious) California
    lifestyle, while simultaneously offering a sly commentary on our national obsession
    with cars.\n\nJack Kerouac, in his iconic introduction to _The Americans_, comments
    on this photograph: \"Car shrouded in fancy expensive designed tarpolian to keep
    soots of no-soot Malibu from falling on new simonize job as owner who is two-dollar-an-hour
    carpenter snoozes in house with wife, and TV, all under palm trees for nothing,
    in the cemeterial California night.\""

  title: Imogen Cunningham
  author: ''
  body: "Cunningham's _Shell Collection 3_ features an array of textures and values,
    including detail-rich dark grays and blacks and luminous, glittering highlights.
    Cunningham's approach in this elegant still life is emblematic of the modernist
    aesthetic that she is known for and championed, and also a work that hints at
    abundance, one that is evocatively sensual. This duality characterizes much of
    her work.\n\nCunningham's earliest photography was Pictorialist in nature, but
    after a 1923 meeting with Edward Weston, she began to favor a modernist approach.
    Her flora and fauna studies of the 1920s and 30s are often associated with this
    shift. These distinctly rendered, close up, elemental, and lush renderings of
    plant life were first shown in the landmark Film und Foto exhibit in Stuttgart
    in 1929. By 1932 she would be a charter member of the West Coast Group f.64, whose
    members favored sharp, unfiltered, and unmanipulated imagery. Their direct, or
    \"straight,\" photographic approach eschewed compositional manipulation in favor
    of recording, and certainly this influence can be seen in _Shell Collection_.\n\nHowever,
    Cunningham explored other photographic styles and subjects throughout her long
    career. \"I photograph anything that can be exposed to light,\" she said, and
    indeed here her apparent desire to look closely from all angles and translate
    to photographic paper form, light, and shape, hints at an emotional appreciation
    for form and abstraction.\n\n> _\"The formula for doing a good job in photography
    is to think like a poet.\"_  \n> Imogen Cunningham"
