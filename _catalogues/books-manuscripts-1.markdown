  title: The Manny Coleman Collection
  body: |-
    I was fortunate to be involved in the purchase of the Manny Coleman collection of some 10,000 rare books on all subjects, assembled by him before 1968, when cancer took his life. The books had stayed in the family home untouched until Colemanâ€™s wife passed away, and the surviving heirs made the difficult decision to sell the collection in 2001.

    Two other bibliophiles and I bought and organized the collection, and eventually sold the majority of it on to other dealers and collectors. The remainder the three of us divided.

    After spending time with the books, certain titles and subjects from the early modern period struck me as exploring issues that are still with us today. With the Coleman books as my foundation, I began to search for additional books that would fit this theme. I understand now that in many ways the issues that plagued the seventeenth century: magical thinking, war, civil unrest, public health, and political strife, are still with us today. At the same time, the scientific experimentation and medical advances that began in this period directly inform current developments in these fields. I really enjoyed building this collection and hope the books will stir the imaginations of others as they have me.
