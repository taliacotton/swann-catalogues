  title: Tom of Finland (1920-1991)
  author: ''
  body: '![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dcryyrd42/image/upload/v1626812087/2578/784283.jpg)Tom
    of Finland (born Touko Laaksonen) pioneered a new freedom and aesthetic in gay
    erotic art. Coming of age in a time and place of extreme censorship, he was inspired
    by the "beefcake" photographs that were primarily distributed through body building
    magazines of the 1940s and \`50s to create a visual language for gay men that
    was hyper-masculine and, over time, increasingly graphic, depicting the wildest
    sexual fantasies. Always instilled with a playfulness and joyful involvement of
    the participants, they also toyed with rebellion and put sex, politics, history,
    and aesthetics on a level playing field. His work became an inspiration for generations
    of artists to find their own voice and expression. His drawings, photographs,
    and collages can be found in several important collections and museums, including
    the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of
    Chicago, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art,
    among others.'
