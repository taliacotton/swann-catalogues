  title: A Window Into the Unseen Life of Blackwell Hospital
  author: ''
  body: |-
    In 1865, Jessie A. Stowers was born in Waddington, New York. She was an 1892 graduate of City Hospital, a nurse at Blackwell, and Superintendent of Gouveneur Hospital from 1895 until 1921.

    Around 1894, when Stowers was stationed on the so-called “Welfare Island” i.e., Roosevelt Island, in the East River, the site housed a notorious complex of workhouses which included a large central hospital, an almshouse, a smallpox hospital, and a hospital designated for patients deemed “incurable” by the system, which included those suffering from mental and physical disabilities.

    Featuring an album compiled during Stower’s time working as a nurse on Blackwell’s Island (now called Roosevelt Island), discover images taken before investigative reporter, Nellie Bly, infiltrated the Women’s Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell Island in 1887, and wrote _Ten Days in a Madhouse,_ an exposé on the inhumane conditions she found there.

    who encouraged her literary efforts. \n\nThis is the first printed edition of
    _Recollection,_ Wheatley’s fourth published poem, and the first time her work
    was published in a magazine. Her poetry came to the attention of George Washington,
    Thomas Paine, John Paul Jones, and Thomas Jefferson, nonetheless she continued
    work as a scullery maid and died in poverty at the age of 31."

  title: The Critically Acclaimed works of American Novelist, Toni Morrison
  author: ''
  body: "Chloe Anthony Wofford Morrison, know as Toni Morrison, was an American novelist,
    noted for her examination of the Black American experience. Morrison spent her
    childhood in the Midwest and then pursued an education at Howard University (B.A.,
    1953) and Cornell University (M.A., 1955).\n\nExtending her studies, Morrison
    taught at Texas Southern University, Howard University, worked as a fiction editor
    for Random House, began teaching writing at the State University of New York and
    went on to join the faculty of Princeton University in 1989.\n\nThroughout her
    academic career Morrison wrote several novels, children’s books, plays and short
    fictions. Featured here is a first edition of Morrison's 1992 novel, _Jazz,_ a
    story of violence and passion set in New York City’s Harlem during the 1920s.
    \n\nHer use of fantasy, her limber poetic forms and her recollection of childhood
    folktales, contributed to the dynamism of the works we explore today."
