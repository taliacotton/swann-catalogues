  author: ''
  body: "Bralds, a mostly self-taught artist from the Netherlands, has been a prolific
    and sought-after illustrator for several decades. He was launched into fame beginning
    in 1978 when he received his first commission with a cover for _TIME_ magazine
    soon followed by his indelible image of the proud Morgaine on horseback gracing
    the cover of _The Mists of Avalon,_ Marion Zimmer Bradley's 1983 women-focused
    historical fiction bestseller about Arthurian legends. Bralds' impressive client
    list includes such notable publications as _Newsweek, Omni Magazine, The Washington
    Post, Rolling Stone, Atlantic Monthly, Esquire, Playboy, Penthouse, National Geographic,_
    and more. His work has been featured in ad campaigns for Alfa Romeo, Atlantic
    Records, Grand Marnier, Gucci, IBM International, Kahlua, Levi-Strauss, Pirelli
    Brazil, among others. \n\nHe has designed three stamp issues for the United Nations
    Postal Service and the United States Postal Service. In the late 1990s, Bralds
    transitioned to a fine art career, displaying his work in exhibits and galleries
    throughout the world.   \n A long list of awards includes a Hall of Fame recognition
    from the Dutch Society of Illustrators, an Andy Award, and a Clio Award. From
    The Society of Illustrators, he has won several medals, the coveted Hamilton King
    Award in 1984 and, just this spring of 2021, was inducted into their prestigious
    Hall of Fame."
