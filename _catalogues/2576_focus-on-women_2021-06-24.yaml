    448 titles in Mexico City and ran an expansive book store. She created a
    printing and bookselling dynasty that persisted for three generations after
    her death. Daughters, daughters-in-law, granddaughters, and
    great-granddaughters continued printing using the Benavides name. (cf.

    member of the Society of Friends who traveled as a transatlantic missionary
    of faith. She arrived in Oyster Bay, Long Island in New York early in 1680,
    traveling with her friends Sarah Yoklet and Lydia Wright. Her main objective
    was establishing Women's Meetings in the colonies as she had done at home in
    Charney Bassett, England.  She visited Providence, Rhode Island; Boston;
    East & West Jersey; Pennsylvania; Barbados; Nevis; and Antigua. While in
    Barbados, she led meetings with Black and white congregants, "and the power
    of the Lord Jesus was mightily manifested, so that my Soul was often melted
    therewith, even in the Meetings of the Negro's or Blacks." This posthumously
    published work is a collection of Vokins's letters, many written during her
    journey. Supporting prefatory material is contributed by several other
    Quaker women, including Theophila Townsend (1656-1692). The Society of
    Friends' strong stance on gender equality meant that Quaker women were able
    to see their own work in print during the 17th century, even as they were
    simultaneously jailed, executed, and otherwise persecuted for their
    beliefs.<br><br>ESTC R9069, listing seven copies in American libraries; Wing

    has transcribed the complete title with printing place (Cologne) and date of
    imprint (1696). Anne of Austria (1601-1666) was queen consort to King Louis
    XIII of France and took up an opposing political position to Cardinal
    Richelieu (as she does in Dumas' novel The Three Musketeers). Despite
    opposition she seized the reins of power as regent on behalf of their son
    after Louis' death. She attracted enemies, and this work is the chief
    witness to them, alleging numerous sexual indiscretions, one with her enemy
    Richelieu, resulting in the apparent royal heir. The book was printed in
    Norwich and in Cologne. Ownership of a copy in France would have been quite
    dangerous in this period, but some person of means commissioned this fine
    copy.

    of woman, love: its function in humanity, and marriage, ending with a
    summary of proposed reforms, and an appeal to women. "How will [woman]
    become the equal of man in civil dignity? When she shall hold a place on the
    jury and by the side of all civil functionaries; shall be a member of boards
    of trade and mercantile associations; and shall be a witness in all cases in

    from Cannon Falls, Minnesota in 1857; one letter from Cannon Falls, MN
    written by Jane Russell (1819-1924); [together with] three letters written
    jointly from Homer and Detroit, Michigan by family friends Mary Jane Mead
    (1818-1849) and her husband Henry Laurens Hammond (1815-1893) in 1843 and
    '44; two early notes written by MHR while at the Wheaton Female Seminary in
    the late 1830s; two letters written by MHR's husband Joseph Peckham
    (1816-1884) while he was in Massachusetts and courting MHR; [and] one letter
    written by JR's husband Captain Charles Weatherby Gelett (1813-1895) whilst
    in Cannon Falls, MN; sizes vary, one Minnesota letter with
    Hastings-postmarked envelope dated 1859; and three other Michigan (Detroit &
    Homer) postmarks from 1843 & 1844; most are addressed to "Mother," Amelia
    Russell; sizes vary.<br><br>The Russell family was headed by epic matriarch
    Amelia Drew Russell (1785-1868), mother and stepmother to nine faithful and
    loving children who dutifully wrote home, along with their spouses and other
    ADR fans throughout the mid-19th century. Although some Russell daughters
    and sons stayed on the east coast, two ranged widely. Jane went whaling with
    her husband (for which see lot 44 this auction), and also settled for a time
    in Cannon Falls, where she and her husband built a house now listed on the
    National Register of Historic Places. Gelett's letter contains details of
    these house plans. <br><br>In her 1859 letter, Jane says that she prefers
    "to sit up a little while after the rest have gone to bed & have the room
    all to myself. It is about all the time I have that is free from
    interruptions." She's been making butter and tending "my old batcheler," and
    notes, "my house is dirty, but they say dirt is healthy." It sounds like
    their house is still under construction. "I got my parlor chamber all ready
    to plaster overhead but no one seems to have any plaster left for me." She
    closes with the sad tale of Mr. Chapman, whose wife just died, leaving a new
    baby behind. "I still miss dear Mrs. C. The babe is looking finely. I held
    him for his mother to bestow on him the first & last smile he had from her.
    I assisted in laying her out & in dressing her for the grave. The little one
    was baptized at the funeral."<br><br>Mary Homer is a very lively
    storyteller. Her two letters from Minnesota contain several amusing
    anecdotes, including April's Fools pranks. "When it was time to light the
    candle, I took the first one that came to hand and lighted it and set it on
    the table. It spattered and sputtered a little and then went out. Jane felt
    rather vexed as she was in a hurry to use it, but I knew there were plenty
    of good ones, so I just laid it one side, and took another. Upon
    examination, we found that it was made of turnip, with a bit of candle wick
    transferred to it. We had a hearty laugh over the joke." At supper time, the
    joker was struggling with some very unyielding butter, which he could barely
    cut, let alone spread onto bread when, "we could not long restrain our
    mirth, but all joined in another hearty laugh that the rogue got caught in
    his own trap. Charles had cut off some pieces of yellow turnip and laid in
    the plate with the butter and they so nearly resembled it. He was completely
    taken in."<br><br>Next, these silly people placed a full-sized "female
    figure" in Chapman's bed chamber while he was out. "We were in our chamber
    when he came back but heard his salutation as he entered his room, 'Hallo
    old woman!' He carried on quite a conversation with her and then took her
    down into the sitting room for he said he could not sleep with her in the
    room. He said that he could get along very well if she would sit with her
    back to him, but he was afraid she might turn around."<br><br>A neighbor has
    a tame faun who runs free. "We frequently hear the tinkling of her bell and
    see her running near the house. She is fond of playing with children, and
    sometimes lets us older folks pat and scratch her. She came to me yesterday
    when I was hanging out clothes, and when I put my face down to her,
    attempted to lap it for me."<br><br>Mary Homer also describes a building
    failure that occurred during a frivolous locally-sourced theater event. "The
    exercises were passing off very pleasantly [...] when there came a sudden
    crash [and we] soon found that the floor beneath us was giving away. A good
    deal of confusion ensued for a few minutes, but the floor sank so gradually
    that no one was seriously hurt. [...] Those in the middle of the room were
    lowered farther into [the cellar] than they cared to be, but they were soon
    helped out and the room cleared." The report of the collapse is followed by
    Mary Homer's critique of Minnesotan construction practices of 1857, compared
    to those found on the east coast.<br><br>Mary Jane Mead, who died at the age
    of thirty-two, includes a few short remarks. She accompanied her husband to
    Michigan, where he organized the first Congregational Church in Detroit in
    1844. Her husband recounts their trip to Homer in detail. MJM hopes to
    welcome Mother Russell "to our western home, for we soon wish to have one."
    Noting, "I think you would be delighted with our beautiful 'wilds' and our
    'oak openings,' 'our Prairies,' our softly gliding streams, our soft, muddy
    roads with scarce a stone to jar or jolt the carriage. I shall be better
    able to say how I like Mich. when I shall have longer resided here." A full
    transcript of the letters is available upon request.

    Twenty-one letters of which seventeen are written by Russell (four written

    Weatherby Gelett (1813-1895) and one written by Mary G. Smith from the ship
    <i>Saratoga</i> to Russell while onboard the <i>Uncas</i>; all but one
    letter addressed to Russell's mother, Amelia Drew Russell (1785-1868); some
    with exotic postmarks from Hong Kong, Hawaii, Lahaina, and other ports; the
    bulk of the letters written during the voyage of Gelett's whaling vessel,
    the <i>Uncas</i>, which was at sea between August 1846 and the spring of
    1849;  most are stamped "Ship" and were eventually routed through New
    Bedford, Massachusetts on their way to Kingston, MA; sizes generally 9 3/4 x
    7 3/4 in.<br><br>For extended periods of time, Russell was left in Hawaii
    while her husband returned with his crew to sea in order to further add to
    his stores of sperm whale oil. Russell's letters are those of a pious New
    England girl, but we can infer her sense of adventure intermingled with her
    sometimes-harping piety. One may also consider that she was writing to her
    mother. Russell recounts some tales of the whaling ship and describes Faial
    in the Azores and her inbound and outbound visits to Valparaiso, Chile. She
    has written up amusing character sketches for each member of the crew as
    well, including each person's name, rank, job onboard and their original
    home places.<br><br>Some of the most interesting material stems from her
    grand adventures on the Hawaiian Islands, where she traveled by foot, double
    canoe, and horseback, was carried in a litter, and visited volcanos and
    missionaries. The longest journey, made with her husband and a retinue of
    about fifteen while he took a break from his seafaring saw them making
    tracks over rugged stretches of "clinkers" (fields of broken-up lava rock)
    and sleeping on the ground in tents, in smoke-filled native grass huts, and
    caves.<br><br>By November of 1848 the <i>Uncas</i> crew had accumulated
    3,700 barrels of whale oil, and the Captain was building his seasick-prone
    wife a house on deck in preparation for the voyage home. Leaving Honolulu at
    this date, headed for Valparaiso, they hope to encounter a few more whales
    along the way to fill the ship completely, and to reach home by May
    1849.<br><br>The California gold rush was complicating the procurement of
    crew in Hawaii in the fall of 1848. Russell notes that sailors were leaving
    in droves (or begging to be released) while others turned down large
    salaries for the chance to try their luck in the gold fields of California.
    She also mentions that measles and whooping cough were sweeping through the
    population of native Hawaiians with devastating effects.<br><br>After
    returning home, Russell and Gelett lived in Minnesota for a short time, but
    the captain was drawn again to the sea, without his wife on subsequent
    voyages. Eventually the couple retires to California. Russell lived to the
    age of 95 and is buried at the Nordhoff Cemetery in Ojai, California.

    born Eliza Rosanna Gilbert in County Limerick, and spent her early years
    between India and the U.K. She was dancing professionally at the age of
    sixteen. Montez had affairs with Franz Liszt, Alexander Dumas, and others.
    As a performer, she most likely engaged in sex work as well; in polite
    society she was described as a courtesan. Her power in this position reaches
    its apex in Munich, where she wielded great influence over King Ludwig I of
    Bavaria as his mistress. Between 1846 and 1848, her role in the court caused
    rather profound political upheaval, ultimately resulting in Ludwig's
    abdication from the throne. Marriages, affairs, and controversy came and
    went in subsequent years as Montez traveled to Australia and the United
    States, performing and dancing professionally. Montez is buried in Brooklyn,
    where she succumbed to syphilis in January of 1861. Aspects of her story
    have been portrayed in many period and modern films and novels, and she may
    be the inspiration for Conan Doyle's Irene Adler. At the time of her death,
    Lola Montez was thirty-nine years old.

    of a letter to her mother originally written in 1863; two small snapshots of
    an elderly woman; [and] nine photographs of an unidentified historic home,
    as found.<br><br>Hawes Terhune was a very successful novelist and writer of
    cook books who began writing and publishing at the age of fourteen. She
    wrote twenty-five novels, and the same number of non-fiction works on
    household management and cooking. Notable contributions include her novels
    <i>Alone</i>, and <i>The Hidden Path</i>, and the wildly successful
    <i>Common Sense in the Household</i>.<br><br>The present diary was written
    before her marriage. She describes her process in vivid detail. "I write
    much now-- to give my mind food, every kind of labor is distasteful-- it
    would rather brood in silence over its own fancies and griefs, but I force
    it into other channels." "I must work, while the day lasts. I do not retire
    at night, until I am so weary that I sleep as soon as I touch the pillow,
    and I lay down my pen only to seek my couch." Even as an accomplished
    published novelist, Hawes's work makes her different and opens her to social
    criticism. "As a compliment [a friend] repeated an observation made in
    relation to me by <i>an admirer and friend</i>. 'She is intellectual, writes
    finely, but her intellect will neither get her a husband, provide comforts
    for him, or make him happy.' 'I wish I could tell you his name, 'said she;
    'you are very intimate with him.' [...] Bitter thoughts swelled in my soul
    this afternoon as I trod the street alone." (See pages 261 ff.) A great
    writer is always great to read, and Hawes is no exception in this candidly
    and sharply written journal. The typist has not taken credit for their work,
    but Hawes's biography does contain the tantalizing note that she taught
    herself how to type after breaking her wrist at the age of seventy.

    the <i>nicest</i> book. 'I could read it right through three times, and it

    1870, Woodhull and Claflin were the first women to open a Wall Street stock
    brokerage. Their father was a snake oil salesman and occasional sham
    attorney or physician. The two girls were exploited for profit by their
    father who promoted them as psychic mediums in their early years, a career
    they continued to cultivate in young adulthood.<br><br>The brokerage was
    very successful, and the profits enabled Woodhull and Claflin to publish
    their own eponymous weekly radical newspaper. Advocates of the Free Love
    movement (which pushed for women's right to marry, divorce, and have
    children without social or state restrictions), their paper was also the
    first in the U.S. to publish Marx's <i>Communist Manifesto</i> in English. 
    Woodhull and Claflin ran for President and Vice President of the United
    States in the 1872 election, nominated by the Equal Rights Party. They faced
    stiff disapproval and opposition and were often simply ignored. Anthony
    Comstock jailed both sisters for publishing an obscene newspaper at the time
    of the 1872 election, making it impossible for them to attempt to vote or
    promote their feminist and suffragist causes. Both women left New York for
    Great Britain in 1877.

    enrolled as a freshman in the inaugural Vassar College class for its first
    school year in 1865. She was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts to parents from
    the East coast. The family was living in Ohio when her younger brother was
    born, and then moved to Minnesota in the 1860s. She lists Faribault,
    Minnesota as her hometown at the time of her college enrollment and is
    recorded living at the same location on the census of 1870. Although she did
    not graduate, she did go on to marry Civil War veteran Elmer John Barker of
    the 5th New York cavalry in McHenry, in Illinois in 1876. She had three sons
    who lived to adulthood and a daughter who passed away in her first year. The
    details of Griggs's life seem to indicate that her parents explored an
    adventurous lifestyle in the middle part of the 19th century. She eventually
    settled in Crown Point, New York, on the west shore of Lake Champlain.
    Although Griggs herself never graduated, her daughter-in-law, Harriet
    Provost Fisher (1886-1974) successfully completed her Vassar degree in 1907,
    and her granddaughter, Janet Barker (1916-1973) was in the graduating class
    of the college in 1937. (cf. Vassar College. <i>Alumnae Biographical

    <br><br>Including more than 375 individual pieces, the vast majority
    correspondence both sent and received by Smith, including approximately
    sixty-five pages dating from the period before she married Charles
    Eigenmann, as her career and studies were getting off the ground, most
    letters addressed to her parents, several to an unidentified friend
    addressed in shorthand symbols; the balance of the material, dating from
    1887 through 1899, representing transitional periods for the scientist, as
    she managed her own work, while coping with a travelling spouse and the
    appearance of five children in her life, one with a disability; the earlier
    period correspondence includes six letters to Smith from William George
    Willoughby (1825-1911) of the California Academy of Sciences, along with
    several receipts from the Academy for biological specimens given by Smith; a
    very large trove of material housed in three thick 3-ring
    binders.<br><br>Rosa Smith Eigenmann is considered the first woman
    ichthyologist in the United States. She discovered a new species of eyeless
    fish, the blind goby or Othonops eos, living in caves beneath the Point Loma
    Peninsula in San Diego, California in 1879. At that time, she was a graduate
    of the Point Loma Seminary and a member of the San Diego Society of Natural
    History. She was the first woman to enjoy full membership in the Society,
    and also served as its librarian and recording secretary. A meeting with
    Indiana University ichthyologist David Starr Jordan allowed her to tour
    Europe in the summer of 1880 and then begin studies in zoology at
    IU.<br><br>Sometime in 1882 she was forced to abandon IU without taking a
    degree and return to California to care for a sick family member. This is
    where the present collection of correspondence begins. In July of 1882 she
    connected with Harford at the California Academy of Sciences, who wrote to
    her regarding her work with the blind goby. She, Jordan, and Harford traded
    samples of rare fish for research during this period as recorded in the
    correspondence here. By June of 1883, Smith is writing from San Francisco
    and actively involved with the Academy of Sciences, describing her work
    there, "I worked at fishes in the Acad. yesterday morning. While there Mr.
    Harford brought in some fishes from China [that were discovered] with gold
    fishes. He put them alive into alcohol for my own collection." She is
    looking for work at the end of July, eventually finding a teaching position
    at Snell Seminary in Oakland.<br><br>Four letters and one signed document
    sent to Smith by close friend, botanist, and landscape architect Kate
    Sessions (1857-1940) from 1885 are included in the lot.<br><br>After Smith's
    marriage to IU ichthyologist Carl Eignemann in 1887, the couple moved to
    Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they both studied fish samples collected by
    Louis Agassiz in South America at Harvard. With the arrival of children,
    Smith is forced to step back from her science career somewhat, but the
    letters from this period are also of great interest as we see her balancing
    the demands of the family while continuing her work.<br><br>1888 is well
    represented in this collection, while the Eingenmann's were stationed at
    Woods Hole, Massachusetts. In all, Smith published twelve papers between
    1880 and 1893, and co-authored an additional twenty-five with her husband.
    This collection offers opportunities to gain greater knowledge of her life.

    considered the foundational San Francisco female painter of the 19th
    century. Her success in creating botanical paintings, portraits, landscapes,
    and pastels earned her gold and silver medals at various expositions. An
    active promoter of the rights of women, she considered herself a "New
    Woman." This term was used by feminists [notably Sarah Grand (1854-1943)] to
    describe an educated, independent person who earned her own money and
    exercised complete autonomy, free from male domination.

    ought to say something about deserted Paris at the time of the near approach
    of the Germans, when we had air raids by night and Bertha by day, and knew
    that if the enemy got a very few miles nearer we might all have to be
    evacuated at a moment's notice. We made light of it at the time, and there
    was very little panic, but thousands and thousands of rich and poor departed
    for the Provinces, and the streets and shops were deserted, the schools

    folio-format ledger books from the period, one in half red morocco with
    marbled paper boards, the other in blind-stamped buckram; containing birth
    information about both children, beginning with Demmer's own daughter,
    Margaret Anderson (d. 1973), with her birth in 1886, recording the child's
    height and weight for her first fifteen years, vaccinations, school details,
    childish drawings, social events, gifts, lists of friends, a large hair
    lock, flowers from MA's wedding, swatches of clothes (perhaps made by MD),
    and wedding ephemera, including a few dried flowers.<br><br>The
    granddaughter, Lucy Emma Barnfield's (1906-1955) album is more detailed,
    dedicated by MD on first leaf, "To the child whose baby days go all too
    quickly," including newspaper clippings on baby care, LB's published birth
    announcement, lists of gifts and givers, and extensive notes taken almost
    daily and quite factual at first: "Born Oct. 22nd, 1906, Monday 7:15 am, 8
    lbs. undressed. We all went to see the baby, a little worried about her feet
    at first, but Dr. B. said they would be all right," "Nov. 10, I changed L.
    first time," "Nov. 17, Mar. not so well, Dr. says not get up yet," "Nov. 24,
    Mar walked from couch to bed first time and came to table for first time,"
    with MD's own personal social notes mixed in.<br><br>By February, as the
    baby starts to engage with her grandmother, the details become more
    interesting, "Lucy doesn't sleep quite as well toward a.m. Her face is quite
    broken out [eczema]. She laughs out loud, reaches out her hands & knows
    people, began 3rd big bottle malted milk," other important milestones are
    recorded in July, when LB can stand alone, walk by holding onto furniture,
    play peek-a-boo and pattycake; the grandmother also notes her own emotions,
    "I wish they would give her to me, it seems as though she must be mine!"
    "She does so many cunning things, I don't know how to write them. For
    instance, she doesn't care for graham crackers, the one thing she could eat.
    She will feed them to Roxy and she has found out she can tease him by
    keeping them back & I will say, give it to Roxy, & she will shake her head
    for no, & when we ask her if she has any teeth she shakes her head & she
    waves her arms and legs for everything, and waves her hand
    bye-bye."<br><br>In all nearly 200 pages are meticulously filled with very
    detailed notes covering LB's first five years, as well as several family
    photographs, LB's early childish scrawls, followed by drawings, and some of
    her first letters; in addition to being an exhaustive history of this child,
    MD's journal is also a document of attitudes and practices surrounding
    children and child-rearing in rural America at the beginning of the 20th
    century, sizes vary, content is extensive. (2)

    born in Waddington, New York. She was an 1892 graduate of City Hospital, a
    nurse at Blackwell, and Superintendent of Gouveneur Hospital from 1895 until
    1921. In the early photo of the original Gouverneur Hospital buildings its
    famous horse-drawn ambulance is standing in readiness. In 1902, Dr. Emily
    Dunning Barringer (1876-1961) became the first woman ambulance physician at
    Gouverneur Hospital, which served the lower east side of New York. Circa
    1894, when Stowers was stationed on the so-called "Welfare Island" i.e.,
    Roosevelt Island, in the East River, it housed a notorious complex of
    workhouses which included a large central hospital, as well as an almshouse,
    a smallpox hospital, and a hospital designated for patients deemed
    "incurable" by the system, which included those suffering from mental and
    physical disabilities. Investigative reporter Nellie Bly infiltrated the
    Women's Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell Island in 1887, and wrote <i>Ten Days in
    a Madhouse</i>, an exposé on the inhumane conditions she found there.

    Slave</i>, was exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show, where its content, a
    barely pubescent nude girl under the cloak of a leering older man in the
    process of offering her for sale, proved controversial. The juxtaposition of
    the nude female form as an object of exploitation did not suit the taste of
    many contemporary observers. St. Leger Eberle's studio was on New York's
    Lower East Side, and her subjects were predominantly the poor and
    working-class children who inhabited the neighborhood. She felt a personal
    responsibility as an artist to "see for people -- reveal them to themselves
    and each other."

    the Gotham Book Mart at 51 West 47th street pasted inside back board, very
    good, 7 x 4 1/4 in.<br><br>Woolf's important contribution to feminist
    literature is a contemplation on women's social treatment (compared to
    men's), and how it affects their creation of art. "This leads to a sketch of
    women's circumstances in the past, and the effect of those circumstances
    upon their writing. The conditions that are favourable to imaginative work
    are discussed, including the right relation of the sexes." (Quoted from the
    dust jacket blurb.)<br><br>Vanessa Bell, Woolf's older sister, and also a
    member of the Bloomsbury Group, studied painting at the Royal Academy. She
    painted, illustrated dust jackets for her sister's work, and produced the
    Famous Women Dinner Service: fifty hand-painted plates celebrating important
    women throughout history, from Catherine the Great and Pocahontas, to
    Charlotte Brontë, Greta Garbo, herself, and her sister.<br><br>The Gotham
    Book Mart was established and run by Frances Steloff (1887-1989) from 1920
    until her death at the age of 101. Steloff's iconic book shop was a hub of
    literary society in the city for more than eight decades. She hosted author
    readings, art shows, and meetings of literary clubs, including the James
    Joyce Society, which held its first meeting there in 1947. A champion of
    literature under siege, Steloff sold banned titles like <i>Lady Chatterley's
    Lover</i>; <i>the Tropic of Cancer</i>; and Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>. When
    Anaïs Nin was forced out of Paris, she sent her books to Steloff for
    safekeeping. (cf. <i>Frances Steloff: Memoirs of a Bookseller</i>, a short

    also was a tri-state tennis champion in college, trained as a nurse, and
    cared for members of the Apache tribe during the 1918 flu pandemic in
    Arizona. Her real love was trick riding. She rode horses and bulls (in
    Mexican bullfights). She claimed to be the first female rider to
    successfully perform the "under the belly crawl," and was famous for jumping
    her horse King Tut over an open car complete with passengers, a trick she
    performed on her wedding day, with her groom in the car. She also worked as
    a stunt rider in films, often riding for male actors, including Tim McCoy,
    Tom Mix, Hoot Gibson, and Ken Maynard. The production stills in this lot
    show a lost western which included Gray in the cast, not as a stunt double.

    Three Glass-plate Astronomical Photographs [together with] New England
    Magazine, 1892.
  TYPESET: >-
    Glass-plate photographs circa 1889; all separately mounted and framed in
    oak, each image plate sandwiched between a sheet of clear and a sheet of
    milk glass to facilitate viewing and scrutiny; labeled 22: Spectrum of
    B[eta] Aurigae; 23: Peculiar Spectra, and 41: untitled, photographic plates
    measure 8 x 10 in., 15 1/4 x 12 1/4 in. overall; [and] the April 1892 issue
    of <i>New England Magazine</i>, Boston: New England Magazine Corporation,
    1892, containing the illustrated article, "Women's Work at the Harvard
    Observatory," by Helen Leah Reed, in original publisher's printed paper
    wrappers, edges chipped, some toning, contents generally good, 10 x 7
    in.<br><br>Mary Anna Draper (1839-1914) established and endowed the Draper
    Memorial after the death of her husband, pioneering astronomical
    photographer Henry Draper.  She had worked alongside him for more than
    fifteen years and sought to continue his work in the spectral analysis of
    stars based on photographs taken through telescopes. Because of her
    influence, women were included on the immense Draper project. Although Reed
    claims in her article that the female scientists who worked under the
    auspices of the Harvard Observatory were paid the same wages as their male
    counterparts, it is now known that they were paid half the hourly rate of
    men and one of the institution's motivations for hiring them.<br><br>Antonia
    Maury (1866-1952) was the first astronomer to detect and calculate the orbit
    of a spectroscopic binary. Maury also discovered Beta Aurigae, the second
    spectroscopic binary star to be identified through spectral analysis. Beta
    Aurigae, whose glass-plate photograph is included in this lot, appears as a
    single star in the night sky, but is actually a binary star system.
    Williamina Fleming (1857-1911), head of the <i>Henry Draper Catalogue</i>,
    developed a classification of stars based on their hydrogen content, and
    discovered the Horsehead Nebula in 1888. Anna Winlock (1857-1904), who
    worked at the Harvard College Observatory for thirty-five years, began by
    reducing and computing meridian circle observations (a potentially useless
    set of numbers left behind after her father's death) and spent twenty years
    making significant contributions to the Astronomische Gesellschaft Katalog.

  TYPESET: >-
    Three-ring binder containing approximately 400 photographs depicting an
    approximate decade in the life of Dr. Clayton; all are small-format,
    black-and-white images, beginning with her time at Mount Holyoke College,
    where she was an assistant professor in the physiology department, many
    showing her colleagues, including the founder of that department, Professor
    Abby Howe Turner (1875-1957), and the other physiology adjuncts: Dorothy
    Elizabeth Williams, Mary Isabel Newton, and Helen McGregor TeWinkel; in
    addition to images of Clayton's recreational activities, which include a
    trip to Europe with friends, day tripping in coastal Maine, hiking, and
    photos of family, snapshots of other medical professionals, such as
    obstetrics and gynecological physician Dr. Katherine Kuder and her sister,
    the researcher Alberta Kuder, and many other women working in the medical
    and scientific fields; photos in a good state of
    preservation.<br><br>Clayton was born in Shelbyville, Indiana. She graduated
    from Bucknell Institute in 1912, and earned a bachelor's degree at Barnard,
    through the Columbia Teacher's College in 1918. She subsequently entered the
    University of Rochester, where she earned her master's degree and Ph.D. in
    vital economics. Clayton taught at Mount Holyoke for six years in the
    physiology department under Professor Turner, specializing in nutrition
    studies. In 1934, she moved to Maine to take a position as nutritionist at
    the university in Orono. This album covers the period at Holyoke, and the
    move to Maine. It illustrates Clayton's life brimming with travel, social
    activities, and adventure, surrounded by a network of other women with
    careers and education similar to her own. When this album arrived at Swann,
    Clayton was unidentified. She had only written "self," "myself," or nothing
    at all on her own pictures. The cataloger is gratified to attach Clayton's
    name and biography to the stories told by these photos.

    This large group of personal material formerly belonged to the artist

    full-length portraits and scenes, the vast majority by Sherman herself;
    approximately twenty original pencil sketches and watercolors; seven

    the Art Students League of New York, and began selling silhouettes in 1915
    at the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco. Although this archive
    demonstrates her mother's influence, as she was also a silhouette artist,
    this fact seems to be omitted from Sherman's biography. The work in the
    archive is substantial, and represents her career quite fully, including
    some vignettes, and many full-length cut portraits. Letterhead,
    advertisements, business cards, and other ephemera punctuate the collection
    by documenting her career. A charming group of colored animal silhouettes
    sent by a young fan is also found in this archive, along with a newspaper
    article describing the boy's work. Sherman doesn't confine herself to
    humans. She also cut charming silhouettes of dogs and a horse or two. The
    unpublished autobiography promises to reveal more of the details of the
    artist's career and life.

    Dunham's Habitation Leclerc in Port-au-Prince, Haiti; [and] two

    full with her address at the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney, Australia; sizes
    vary, in all sixteen pieces.<br><br>Other than the carbon of the letter to
    Pratt, all other correspondence is directed to Dorothy Gray Breed
    (1922-1976), Dunham's assistant and friend. The two referred to themselves
    charmingly as "Dorf" and "Calf," which is how Dunham signs her letters.
    Letters to Gray are consumed with the daily struggles of setting contracts
    for the dance company while on a series of international tours. They are
    exhaustively detailed. Some personal notes appear as well, but it's mostly
    business.<br><br>The long 1957 letter to her husband written from Japan is
    different. Composed at the end of a bitterly disappointing tour (financially
    and emotionally), Dunham is also not well physically. She has just lost her
    stepmother, really the only mother she knew, and is struggling to pay her
    company and get them travelling. In Japan she lives in an attic and tries
    her best to pick up the pieces. She hopes to sell a valuable necklace in
    Paris, and despairs that the 18 tons of gear belonging to the troupe may be
    sold at auction for want of the storage fees. Dunham ended up spending a
    year in Japan, writing and healing. She wrote <i>A Touch of Innocence</i>,
    her childhood memoir, during this period. Even when writing about contracts
    and finances, or at this emotional low point, Dunham's skill with words is
    on display.<br><br>"The company and every fact of it needed and will need if
    it does operate again only the good and positive, only the hopeful and
    careful and nourishing, to it and especially to me, not because I'm me or
    feel myself to be special or apart or better, but because I do represent
    original knowledge and investment in so many ways. [...] To what good then
    painful destruction, unkind criticism, conflict, grief, heartache, personal
    insecurity, embarrassment, often disgrace, I say to myself many times during
    the night, why - why."

    portrait to the Sister Chapel project. "The Sister Chapel (1974-78) was an
    important collaborative installation that materialized at the height of the
    women’s art movement. Conceived as a nonhierarchical, secular commemoration
    of female role models, The Sister Chapel consisted of an eighteen-foot
    abstract ceiling that hung above a circular arrangement of eleven monumental
    canvases, each depicting the standing figure of a heroic woman." It was
    created by a collaborative group of women artists in 1974. As a feminist
    conscious-raising experience, this project sought to create an alternative
    to the patriarchy. It is on display at Rowan University in Glassboro, New
    Jersey. (cf. Andrew D. Hottle's <i>The Art of the Sister Chapel</i>, New

    RISD (where she studied silver design), and NYU. She employed female
    designers like Goldsmith at her firm throughout its history from 1932

    (1877-1962) research in developing the bathysphere, a vessel capable of
    exploring the ocean at great depths. The project also employed a number of
    female scientists, artists, and research assistants on Nonsuch Island. In
    this album we find photographs of Gloria Hollister (1900-1988), who set a
    world record for the deepest dive performed by a woman on her thirtieth
    birthday in the bathysphere; Jocelyn Crane (1909-1998), who studied
    crustaceans and specialized in fiddler crabs; natural history illustrator
    for the Zoological Society's Helene-Therese Tee-Van (1893-1976); Kathryn
    Leigh [aka Binx], who served as laboratory secretary; Else Bostlemann,
    another artist; and others. (cf. Carol Grant Gould's <i>The Remarkable Life
    of William Beebe</i>, Washington: Island Press, 2004.)<br><br>The
    scientists, research assistants, and other contributors to the project are

    cancer treatment that ended her life at the age of fifty-two. In the late
    1960s, she used clay to make small sculptures of the vulva. As she explored
    the work further, she expanded her preferred media to include chewing gum,
    kneaded erasers, dryer lint, and other unconventional materials. In the
    1970s, she began working in photographic body art, applying dozens of small,
    sculpted vulvas to her own body. The work later took the form of more
    involved "perfomalist" video self-portraits.

    stamps on versos.)<br><br>Lauraine & Lennette are siblings who participated
    in the University of Minnesota’s “Transsexual Research Project," undergoing
    gender reassignment surgeries in 1967. "After being female for 48 years I
    will tell you that my sister and I have not regretted one moment of that 48
    years. Would I go through numerous surgeries, and endure all that pain and
    tears again? You ‘betcha’, as life as a male would be unendurable and life
    would not be worth living." (Lauraine Lee, 22 March 2015;
    http://transascity.org/lenette-and-lauraine-lee-1970/)<br><br>April Ashley,
    born in Liverpool in 1935, was outed by the <i>Sunday People</i> newspaper
    in 1961. The British courts found that she was not entitled to support
    following her divorce because she was a legal man and therefore could not
    legally wed "another" man. Her autobiography, <i>The First Lady</i>, came
    out in 2006.<br><br>Christine Jorgensen (1926-1989) grew up in the Bronx and
    served in the army during World War II. Because her transition was highly
    publicized, and she was a proficient communicator, and wonderful public
    presence, she contributed greatly to the general public's awareness of trans
    issues and trans rights, in addition to supporting other trans people.

  CROSSHEAD: 'Free Norma Jean Croy, Original Silkscreen for Making T-Shirts.'
  TYPESET: >-
    [?San Francisco, 1980s or 1990s.]<br><br>The original silkscreen used to
    make t-shirts for Croy's cause; [together with] a white t-shirt newly
    printed from the silkscreen; signs of use, old ink.<br><br>Norma Jean Croy
    was convicted of the pre-meditated murder of a police officer and sentenced
    to life in prison based on a racially charged incident in Yreka, California
    in 1978. An argument at a convenience store escalated to a melee at a
    private home in the course of which the police discharged more than 200
    rounds, and a small group of young Shasta-Karok Native Americans fired three
    bullets. Croy and her brother were both shot by the police. Her brother
    returned fire, killing a police officer instantly with one shot. Norma Jean
    never handled any weapons. Nonetheless, she was convicted and jailed. Judge
    Edward Stern, who presided over Croy's brother's appeal in 1991 noted, "I
    think that when Norma Jean Croy comes up for a parole hearing again, [...]
    the parole board should take into consideration the fact that this court
    believes that had Norma Jean Croy been tried in the case I heard, [she]
    would have been found not guilty. [...] I want the record to be clear that
    this is my judgment, my opinion, having heard the evidence in this case."
    Croy was finally exonerated and released from prison in 1997, after being
    wrongly incarcerated for eighteen years. In the 1990s, Croy's cause, often
    alongside that of Leonard Peltier, was featured by a number of social
    justice groups working to free wrongly convicted indigenous Native
    Americans. This silkscreen is proof of the insistent grassroots activism
    that helped keep her case in the public eye.

    x 20 1/2 in.<br><br>"Graphics Collective posters appeared in peoples' homes,
    women's liberation offices, coffee shops, women's centers, women's health
    clinics, labor unions, and even on the set of a popular TV sitcom. All work
    was done in teams of 2-4 women led by an artist-designer. The Collective
    wanted a new feminist art that transcended the highly individualistic 'Great
    Men of Art' syndrome. Members would propose a poster idea and then recruit a
    team to actually produce it. This method incorporated the vision of the
    individual artist into the collective art process. Thousands of posters were
    distributed worldwide during the Collective's 13-year history from
    1970-1983. Today some of their best efforts are considered classics of
    feminist poster art." (Estelle Carol, founding member, for more information
