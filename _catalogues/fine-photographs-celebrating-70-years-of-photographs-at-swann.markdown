  title: Celebrating 70 Years of Photography at Swann
  author: ''
  body: "Over 70 years ago, Swann held the first auction dedicated to photography
    in the United States. This 1952 photography auction was astonishingly early for
    a sale devoted to a medium just 113 years old and still finding its artistic footing
    in the marketplace. Seven decades later, however, the landscape for this diverse
    and innovative medium has grown dramatically.  The past few decades bore witness
    to a blossoming market, with numerous galleries, auction houses, and a vibrant,
    devoted, passionate group of collectors spread around the world. \n\nIn 1952,
    albums and books illustrated with photographs dominated the sale at Swann. The
    sales results are shocking to a contemporary reader: a nearly complete set of
    Eadweard Muybridge’s Animal Locomotion (with duplicate plates) sold for $250,
    and William Henry Fox Talbot’s Pencil of Nature for $200. The catalogue had no
    illustrations or estimates, and though the offerings were diverse, the medium’s
    early relationship with the book field is apparent.\n\nToday we see a full spectra
    of photo books, contemporary photographs made to occupy an entire wall, small
    classical gems, and modernist masterpieces exploring abstraction in our auctions.
    To date, our Department’s top lot is Edward S. Curtis’ The North American Indian,
    which sold for $1.44 million.  This market has expanded and flourished, and our
    auctions at Swann continue the tradition of groundbreaking exploration of the
    medium, most recently in our photo book and vernacular photography sales (introduced
    in 2006 and 2014, respectively). These sales advance the boundaries of what is
    sought and reconsider the ways in which we view and discuss photographic output.\n\nToday
    we look both forward and backward. Back, to marvel at what has grown. Forward,
    to imagine what we can still build."
