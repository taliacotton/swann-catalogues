    Aquatint and engraved map of the moon's surface on a sheet with two columns

    size, wide margins with deckle edges; old folds, foxing.
  at-a-glance: '[Rome?, circa 1787]'
  FOOTNOTE: >
    Cassini's large-scale map of the moon printed in 1679 was an influential
    scientific phenomenon. Even at the time of its publication copies were
    scarce and the copper printing plate was presumed lost for over 100 years.
    In 1787 Cassini's heirs discovered the plate in the archives of the
    Imprimerie Royale and a new edition was struck; and along with it, a certain
    renewed interest to the greater public and scientific community.


    The present Italian broadside is a piggyback on that re-kindled awareness of
    lunar cartography; Giovanni Brun reproduces the layout of the original with
    general faithfulness but gives us a greatly reduced model with topographical
    nomenclature added. One playful detail that is repeated from the original is
    a subtly hidden head of a woman peering out from the Promontorium Heraclides
    at lower right, a feature quasi-famously known as Cassini's "Moon Maiden".

    <i>Situate on the South side of the River Susquehanna; Opposite to 3
    Islands, in Catawisa Township Northumberland County, (about 30 Miles above
    Sunbury & about the same Distance below Wilksbury,) in the State of
    Pennsylvania. Laid out by the Proprietaries of this land Mess. Wm.
    Rittinghouse & John Kunchel. [sic].</i>  Ink on vellum, 22¼x24 inches at
    widest; old folds and expected soiling but overall good.  Provenance:
    Christie's New York, June 10, 1993, lot 389.
  at-a-glance: 'Eastern Pennsylvania, 1796'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The title here is misleading since there does exist Mifflinburg,
    Pennsylvania, approximately fifty miles to its west; however, the beginnings
    of the town of Mifflinville are represented by this original hand-drawn
    plat. 


    A tiny community on the banks of the Susquehanna River in Columbia County,
    Mifflinville's layout hasn't changed a great deal in the intervening 225
    years since this document was drafted: the sparse north/south streets remain
    John, Mary, Ann, Market, Race, and Fair; the east/west streets shown here
    only to Fifth have expanded a whole two blocks up to Seventh. At the center
    of the map between Ann and Race streets we find "Burying Grounds" and indeed
    the town's cemetery is still located in that spot, with a modicum of homes
    and scarce businesses built up around it. 


    Lettered references are keyed with an explanatory panel at the upper left:
    "A. A Market place, and in the Center of it a public building. B for an
    English College. C for a German College. D is the ground or places marked
    and laid out for the different denominations of Christian Societies. The
    vacant ground, in Front of the Town, is to be left open for use of the whole
    Town, except the use of the Ferry, and the Fishing is Kept for the
    Proprietors & is marked in the Plan F/M or for a Fish market". 


    This is followed by an outline of Conditions for the town's establishment:
    "There are 10 places laid out for the use of Churches & meeting houses of
    the different denominations of Societies & the first 12 Settlers of any
    Society shall have the first choice of one of said 10 places, for that
    purpose, & the next 12 Settlers of any Society shall have the same choice as
    before & so on until the 10 places are applied for the purpose aforesaid.
    The out Lots belonging to the East Liberty lay about a mile from
    Mifflinsburg. April 8th 1796". 


    The industry and commerce which the proprietors surely imagined for the
    future of their town never much materialized and at no point has her
    population grown far beyond 2,000 residents; but from a historical
    standpoint it is delightful to compare this birth-certificate document to
    the Mifflinville of today and observe how closely it still resembles
    Rittenhouse and Kunkle's original 18th-century plan. 


    For an extensive history of the town (with mention of the present document)
    see J.H. Beers, Historical and Biographical Annals of Columbia and Montour
    Counties, Pennsylvania, 1915, pages 249-252.

    Peter Furse was a British Navy officer who began his service in World War I
    at age 17, during which time he received his first exposure to map drafting.
    After the war he continued his education at the University of Cambridge and
    when World War II came, he again served with the Royal Navy, ultimately
    elevating to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. After spending several years
    in Africa, Furse and his wife Barbara settled down in the village of
    Hampton, New Brunswick, Canada. There he spent his retirement years creating
    and publishing well-studied whimsical pictorial cartography in the
    mid-1960s. 


    Here Furse has rendered an incredibly detailed manuscript map that richly
    describes the regional history of southern Ontario from the age of discovery
    to the mid-twentieth century. A small sampling of the illustrated anecdotes
    includes: 


    1849 the first sod turned for Great Western Railway, at London; 1883 the
    first free public library in Ontario at Guelph; 1755 the first Canadian Navy

    Pen and ink map of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island
    drawn on an untrimmed deckle-edged sheet of "JWhatman/1959" watermarked wove
    paper; 27¾x40½ inches overall; minimal margin soiling and short edge

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Peter Furse was a British Navy officer who began his service in World War I
    at age 17, during which time he received his first exposure to map drafting.
    After the war he continued his education at the University of Cambridge and
    when World War II came, he again served with the Royal Navy, ultimately
    elevating to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. After spending several years
    in Africa, Furse and his wife Barbara settled down in the village of
    Hampton, New Brunswick, Canada. There he spent his retirement years creating
    and publishing well-studied whimsical pictorial cartography in the
    mid-1960s. 
     
    The present manuscript was published circa 1963 with lithographed examples
    located at the Tides Institute Museum of Art, and (as of November 2021) one
    copy on offer by a Canadian mapseller. That printed map measures
    approximately 2/3 smaller than our original drawing. 


    The map is painstaking in its arrangement of regional information and
    illustrative charm; a small sampling of the illustrated anecdotes includes: 


    1580 Sable Island, first settlement. 40 convicts landed by first Governor,
    de la Roche. 12 survivors; C1810 222 negroes to Freetown, Sierra Leone at
    their own request. Freetown was started by British abolitionists in 1787, 34
    years before U.S.A. started Liberia; 1524 Verrazano exploring, in "Dolphin",
    reported U.S.A. to be a narrow strip. Contemporary maps show "The Gulf of
    Verrazano" where (inland) Carolina, Virginia, Maryland & Pennsylvania should
    be; 1753 1,600 German colonists to Lunenburg; 1761 First ship built in
    Yarmouth, "James". Later built more tonnage per head than any other place in
    the world; 1849 "Pony Express" Halifax-Digby for first formed "Associated
    Press"; 1765 First Agricultural Show in the Maritimes at Windsor; 1604 de
    Monts, Champlain, Pontrincourt, Pontgrave explored Fundy, 1605 they explored
    Annapolis Basin; 1612 Chief Membertou baptized; 1534 Cartier 1st fur trade
    at Baie des Chaleurs; 1745 Georgetown [PEI] destroyed by New Englanders;
    1656 First settlers - Nicholas Denys reported Caribou; 1785 Last Walrus
    seen, Magdalen I.; 1820 Indian couriers carried mail between Halifax &
    Sydney; 1715 The impregnable fortress of Louisbourg built; 26 July 1758
    Generals Amherst & Wolfe with Admiral Boscawen took Louisbourg for the last
    time; C1000-1121 Eric the Red, Bishop Eric of Iceland in search of Vineland;
    and there is also a large embellished panel at left describing "Events, for
    the illustration of which, space is lacking".

    "During this painful operation, most of these young men, as they took their
    position to be operated upon, observing me taking notes, beckoned me to look
    them in the face, and sat, without the apparent change of a muscle, smiling
    at me whilst the knife was passing through their flesh, the ripping sound of
    which, and the trickling of blood over their clay-covered bodies and limbs,
    filled my eyes with irresistible tears. When these incisions were all made,
    and the splints passed through, a cord of raw hide was lowered down through
    the top of the wigwam, and fastened to the splints on the breasts or
    shoulders, by which the young man was to be raised up and suspended. …He was
    thus raised some three or four feet above the ground, until the buffalo
    heads and other articles attached to the wounds swung clear, when another
    man, his body red and his hands and feet black, stepped up, and, with a
    small pole, began to turn him around. The turning was slow at first, and
    gradually increased until fainting ensued, when it ceased. In each case
    these young men submitted to the knife, to the insertion of the splints, and
    even to being hung and lifted up, without a perceptible murmur or a groan;
    but when the turning commenced, they began crying in the most heartrending
    tones to the Great Spirit, imploring him to enable them to bear and survive
    the painful ordeal they were entering on. This piteous prayer, the sounds of
    which no imagination can ever reach, and of which I could get no
    translation, seemed to be an established form, ejaculated alike by all, and
    continued until fainting commenced, when it gradually ceased. …what that
    double agony actually was, every adult Mandan knew, and probably no human
    being but a Mandan ever felt. …Each body lowered to the ground appeared like
    a loathsome and lifeless corpse. No one was allowed to offer them aid whilst
    they lay in this condition. They were here enjoying their inestimable
    privilege of voluntarily entrusting their lives to the keeping of the Great
    Spirit, and chose to remain there until the Great Spirit gave them strength
    to get up and walk away."

    Five of Thomas Davies' unquestionably rare "Six Views of North American
    Waterfalls Dedicated to His Excellency Lieut. General Sir Jeffrey Amherst": 


    - An East View of the Great Cataract of Niagara. 

    - A North View of the Pisaiack Falls, in the Province of New Jersey in North
    America. 

    - A North West View of the Cohoes, or Great Cataract of the Mohawk River, in
    the Province of New York in North America. 

    - A South East View of the Lower Cataract on the Casconchiagon or Little
    Seneca's River, on Lake Ontario. 

    - A North West View of the Half Moon or Second Fall in the River
    Cosconchiagon on Lake Ontario. 

    - (presently excluding A South East View of the Great Cataract on the
    Casconchiagon or Little Seneca's River, on Lake Ontario). 


    British army officer Thomas Davies was a pioneering artist of colonial North
    America, honing his skills while surveying (and skirmishing) in the
    wilderness of the northeast during the French and Indian War. The original
    watercolors Davies painted to serve as models for these engravings were
    produced during this period and persist as some of the earliest first-hand
    visual records of the region's topography taken by a European. 


    "Views like those produced by Davies are not fanciful studio illustrations
    of idealized scenery, but renderings of nature observed, the landscape laid
    down in such a way that is both recognizable and informative… Davies's
    landscape is not a drawing of a cascade with its fugitive light, bewildering
    movement, and overpowering noise; it is a drawing of a specimen, a waterfall
    catalogued and described in an inventory of the falls of Canada" - Victoria
    Dickinson, Drawn From Life: Science and Art in the Portrayal of the New
    World, pages 198-199, 201. 


    While Davies should naturally receive the lion's share of acclaim for his
    trailblazing presence of time, place, and compositional abilities, major
    endorsement must be afforded to the skillful engraving of John Fougeron,
    Peter Mazell, and Thomas Morris, each translating to the plate with such
    fidelity the subtle nuances of flowing water, rocky strata, dense timber and
    overall feel for the unspoiled natural phenomenon of these waterfalls.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    "This stunning aquatint was conceived through the combined efforts of two of
    the most talented participants in nineteenth-century American printmaking
    circles: the young John William Hill (he was twenty-four years old at the
    time) and the master aquatint engraver William James Bennett. While
    maintaining undisputed harmony in the wide pictorial world he has
    constructed, Hill presents five different topographic spheres: a scene in
    Brooklyn, nautical activity on the East River, the dense settlement of
    Manhattan, the Hudson River, and the far-off shores of New Jersey. This he
    has done innovatively, without reference to the conventional devices of a
    foreground landscape, coulisse trees, or other border elements traditionally
    used in achieving a compact, pleasing design. ...The copperplate that
    resulted from the collaboration of Hill and Bennett is still in existence.
    It was found at the turn of the twentieth century in the old establishment
    of Currier and Ives, where it had long served as a floor plate under a
    stove. As the sky was badly damaged, it was burnished out of the plate" --

  at-a-glance: 'New York, circa 1907'
  FOOTNOTE: >
    A dominant rendering of the magnificent Gothic-inspired Financial District
    skyscrapers designed by New York City architect Francis H. Kimball. 


    A signature cannot be located but the inimitable style and detailed focus of
    Hughson Hawley is seen in every block of curtain wall limestone and
    ornamental finial. Trinity Church and the Empire Building (also designed by
    Kimball) can be seen to the left of the Broadway façade; a wide-open plaza
    is to the right where Zuccotti Park currently exists; and an elevated train
    runs behind the buildings. 


    We have been able to trace several instances of the image reproduced in the
    early 20th century, though nothing close to the grand scale of this original
    watercolor. Its likeness is pictured and captioned in the January 26, 1907
    Real Estate Record and Builders' Guide on page 156; on several contemporary
    postcards or advertisement-type ephemera; and the Museum of the City of New
    York holds a photographic dry plate negative of the watercolor, credited to
    the Wurts Brothers. 


    In the lower margin there is some writing, "For Mr. Kimball…", a line which
    appears to be something along the lines of original framing specifications
    rather than a gift inscription. Certainly Mr. Kimball would have wished to
    proudly display such an authentic and imposing illustration of one of his
    greatest architectural achievements.
