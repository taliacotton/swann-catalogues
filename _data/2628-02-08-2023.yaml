    In early 1779, George Washington made preparations for a campaign against
    Fort Detroit from Fort Pitt, requiring attacks against the Seneca villages
    along the Allegheny River. In April, Washington ordered General Daniel
    Broadhead to cancel the campaign he led, but, with the approval of
    Washington, Broadhead continued disrupting the loyalists and allied Indians
    in the region, destroying crops and dwellings in order to drive them to
    under-resourced British camps.

    "HAVE NO APPREHENSIONS OF THE EFFECTS OF GENERAL HAMILTON...IN
    OUR...ELECTION"
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    ". . . [Y]ou need have no apprehensions of the effects of General Hamilton's
    exertions in our approaching election. If no fraud shall be practiced, our
    assembly ticket in this City will be carried by a Majority still greater
    than that of the last year. We have on the republican side . . . at least a
    dozen Men superior to Gen'l H. both in public debate & in active powers &
    exertions in a business of this kind. The only difference is that they do
    not puff themselves in the newspapers & thus you at a distance do not hear
    of them--but mark the effect. . . .

    "Fabius must not be set up as a Candidate unless there be a certainty of his
    success. Nor should he consent to the use of his name until there shall
    appear, in various, if not every, part of the State, a zeal and eagerness
    for the measure. Though I feel a lively interest in your success, I also
    feel much for his individual happiness, I may add, and for that of the fair
    Sarah & Maria. . . ."

    In 1798, President Adams appointed Hamilton Commanding General of the U.S.
    Army, passing up men with deep military experience, such as Benjamin
    Lincoln, George Clinton, Horatio Gates, Henry Knox and Charles Cotesworth
    Pinckney. If Hamilton's appointment didn't enrage Burr, who also had
    military ambitions, Burr certainly did not appreciate Hamilton's efforts to
    discredit him during the presidential election of 1800. According to the
    election system of the time, the ticket whose candidate received the most
    electoral votes would become president and the other candidate on the ticket
    would become vice president. The vote in 1800 resulted in the Republican
    candidates receiving more votes than the Federalist candidates, but the
    votes were the same for both candidates on the Federalist ticket, leaving
    the House of Representatives to break the tie and resolve whether Burr or
    Thomas Jefferson would become president. Hamilton persuaded some of his
    fellow Federalists in the House to vote against Burr, denying him the
    presidency. In 1804, when Burr tried to run for offices as a Federalist,
    Hamilton launched a campaign similar to the one in 1800 that threatened to
    ruin Burr's reputation. Later that year, Hamilton died by the shot of Burr's
    pistol.

    In August of 1783, Percival and Anthony Pawley engaged an attorney to
    recover a group of 10 enslaved people who had escaped to Boston, where
    slavery had recently been abolished. On October 6, 1783, SC Governor Guerard
    wrote a letter to MA Governor Hancock demanding restitution for the damages
    caused by MA's harboring of the slaves and demanding their return. Chief
    Justice of the MA Supreme Judicial Court, William Cushing, explained to
    Hancock that nothing undertaken by the authorities in MA violated the
    Articles of Confederation nor attacked the sovereignty of SC, which
    information was likely conveyed in the enclosure that accompanied the
    present letter to Guerard. Hancock did nothing to locate the "negroes," and
    without any guarantees of protection from MA, no one from SC pursued them.

    "ITALY IS WAKING UP TREMENDOUSLY, ARCHITECTURE . . . BURSTING OUT
    EVERYWHERE"
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    ". . . Your letter contains positive things: the first is the idea of
    building an aquarium in Venice. Obviously this idea interests me a lot. I
    know the London aquarium, which the director of the Zoological Garden showed
    me during Pentecost. It's very interesting to make an aquarium, I couldn't
    ask for more. It will even give me great pleasure. The difficulty is to make
    architecture as beautiful as some of the fish in the Adriatic Sea . . . .

    "But what would interest me much more . . . would be to try to make a modern
    house in Venice (an ordinary house, the house of an honest man) in keeping
    with the splendours of the architecture of the past. And by splendor I mean
    just as much the modest house as the Palace. . . . The question is . . . to
    find a harmony between today and yesterday . . . employing the techniques of
    today with, if possible, as much brilliance as the Venetians of yesteryear .
    . . . The more I travel, the more I find that it is the contemporary spirit
    which constitutes, generation after generation, the chain of kinship, human
    harmony, and a fundamental unity. Any look back creates a lie and a hiatus.

    "The . . . point about . . . the contact to be made with Count VOLPI about .
    . . the new industrial Venice. You encourage me to intervene. When I was in
    Venice, I was also full of fire and indignation, and I felt it my duty to
    inform a man of Count VOLPI's worth about the present state of ideas . . .
    in matters of housing. . . . I will send Count VOLPI a note . . . . The only
    thing that worries me is that he does not have time to read these and that
    my intervention is therefore of the nature of a mosquito bite, and nothing
    more.

    "Italy is waking up tremendously, architecture and town planning are
    bursting out everywhere. The welcome I received in Rome and Milan is such
    that I can, without boasting, admit a part of paternity in this Italian
    renaissance (how pretty the word is!). If Count VOLPI wanted, as you say, to
    appeal to people from all over the world and ask me to explain to him what
    application can be made in Venice of the architectural and urban revolution
    in the field of housing, I would be charmed. I've reached an age where you
    almost start to get tired of always knocking on other people's doors and
    where you would like someone to call you from time to time. . . ."

    In 1945, Ezra Pound was arrested by U.S. authorities and charged with
    treason. Most of his 12-year imprisonment was spent at St. Elizabeths
    psychiatric hospital in Washington, DC, during which time Pound's case was
    never brought to trial. In 1956, St. Elizabeths concluded that Pound's
    condition made him unfit to stand trial. Friends of Pound, including
    Archibald MacLeish, Graham Greene, Jean Cocteau, and T.S. Eliot, appealed to
    the U.S. Attorney General to review the case with an eye toward extraditing
    him to the U.K., if no trial was forthcoming in the U.S. Pound was
    discharged in 1958, after a judge's motion to dismiss the 1945 indictment
    went unopposed by the Attorney General.

    ". . . [W]as happy to have Lettow-Vorbeck. He was a very noble character and
    can certainly put solid kraut dullness over one of the most brilliant
    campaigns in history. But Rommel is dull reading too. Very few krauts make
    good reading. I suppose it is because they tell the truth & keep back
    anything that should not be shared with outsiders. Also they always write as
    though they hoped they might have a chance to fight the same campaign over
    again.

    "Here the weather has finally turned for the good & we may even have some
    fishing. George Saviers should be down in a few days, and will be able to
    give a good look at Mary's arm. . . . Am running hard in everything except

    why as complicated as charge of late [light?] brigade. Very difficult piece
    but I hope it will be good. Something in it for everybody including the
    crows. Am tired of skinning all these dead horses and they can take
    bullfighting, for the moment, and put it where they found it. After this
    appendix is finished will relinquish it to Tynan, Buckley and whoever wants
    it if they can find it. . . . Last summer was the best time I ever had and
    am only bitching so as not to be rude around the house. . . .

    ". . . Forgot to thank you for the Burgos clipping. Do you think you could
    find one on the fight at Dax where the bull stepped on Antonio's foot?
    Unfortunately, that is all I remember about that fight except that the bulls
    had their horns shaved down to the quick. Remember all about Jamie[?] &
    giving him the smelling salts & about Luis Segura making such a bloody fool
    of himself. But mostly I recall how La Barata [pet name of his Lancia car?]
    farted & spat, Nicole & her relatives & the bull stepping on Antonio's foot.
    You can see how difficult it is to have only selective recall. From San
    Sabastian on it gets quite vivid. . . . Hotch [A.E. Hotchner] has all sorts

    chases spectres might well be thought to sicken fish. By all accounts
    besides, the periodicity is, for each island, regular. The difficulty is
    that it should vary and be even reversed from isle to isle. Touched with a
    sense of this, Monsieur Wilmot, conseiller-général, an able man--the author,
    at least, of an able pamphlet on the archipelago--made a number of well
    considered experiments. Catching wholesome fish on the outside, he had them
    sunk . . . to different depths and over different bottoms in the lagoon.
    Over pearl shell, it appears they remained innocuous; but the proximity of
    certain sorts of coral, above all in the season of its flowering, poisoned
    them in an exposure of twelve days. . . ."

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Letters: 20 August [1931]: ". . . I am doing little work at present in
    painting, most of my labor is going into my place, digging and building.
    I've done two watercolors and I have all the drawings of the early summer,
    but I am holding my energies for the winter."

    [26 March 1933]: ". . . I have to work by exact schedule--so much done each
    day in order to open the 1st of June in Chicago--every minute counts. So far
    I have done more extensive work than New School & Whitney Museum put
    together--and under this pressure I believe I am doing my best work. . . .
    We fought a little over the inclusion of the Ku Klux Klan and the bank
    failures but they gave in and now even the governor backs me up.

    "We are in a revolution, Hymie. Something is happening to this country,
    psychologically. It is my good fortune to be the one probably who will
    change . . . officially sanctioned art. No state, heretofore would ever have
    had the nerve to hire an artist and let him paint the actual fact--the evil
    as well as the good.

    "We will see what comes of it. Whether or not it wrecks my backers
    politically."

    25 May 1933: ". . . I have had my way all through this work and it is far
    superior to any that I have done before. . . .

    "It is certain to get a lot of publicity after the first hurrah of the
    Fair's opening is over. For once a State exhibit is something other than a
    farce and that must automatically draw intelligent attention.

    "I am probably in for more berating from our critical friends, what I do is
    a little too much for their delicate sensibilities, but that won't make any
    difference if the American people should wake up and realize that for once
    they have been fairly and accurately portrayed. . . .

    "I believe it possible that these bad years have taken the blinders off a
    good deal of intelligence that was pulling the red band wagon just through
    pure inertia. I have a hope that maybe I'll get somewhere yet. We'll see. .
    . ."

    29 August 1933: ". . . What I can judge of reports in the Times give me the
    feeling that Art is at a pretty low ebb right now.

    "I have been a little discouraged by the poor publicity my Indiana mural
    received. This was my best job and yet I rarely see anything about it. . .
    ."

    31 December 1935: ". . . I am still working on the plans of my murals for
    the State Capitol but expect to get at the walls within six or eight more
    weeks. . . .

    "I do not miss all the quarreling and bickering of the New York Art world.
    In fact it is grand to work in peace. . . ."

    17 October 1941: ". . . You understand that my language in New York was
    figurative--but don't fool yourself and say that it didn't contain a lot of
    truth. This whole museum business is rotten and I'm not yet through with it.
    Read my article in the June issue of 'Common Sense' . . . ."

    23 April 1964: ". . . I've outlived the 'movements', the critics, the arty
    art experts, . . . the bright boys and the holy boys and girls--the social
    content children with the Commie bias, I mean. It looks like I've got
    America behind me--and that's more, by far, than I ever expected.--and,
    certainly, enough for me . . . ."

    to be of good portent, in the re-building of devastation-ruined cities;
    especially that there was re-awakened interest in beautifying places, even
    amongst the wrecked streets & places [squares?].

    "It must be one of the strangest experiences imaginable, to return to a city
    and find every familiar street and place so utterly changed. I should dread
    the experience, in Berlin W., where for so many years I lived, of finding
    only demolished houses. . . . [I]n my dreams I especially love to roam along
    the streets in the vicinity of the Lützow Platz; the Maassen Strasse and

    have the treasure of remembering all these places as they were when I

    no need to do any such thing . . . . [I]t feels as though knowing you, you

    need than ever to write & photograph--to create the equivalent in form [to]
    that which is the essence called You. . . . I will tell you about Agnes
    Meyer. I can realize what an influence she must have been in your young
    life. For 6 or 7 years she & I were very close friends. . . ."

    The postscript: "You wrote: 'You stood by the doorway & talked to me. I
    heard every word you said, but I didn't hear any words. For suddenly I saw
    the thing behind your words. I saw the essence of you, the highly personal .
    . . you. I was completely destroyed. . . . I was not there. I was not
    anywhere. I had ceased to exist.'

    collapse or write. . . .

    actually exist. . . ."

    December of 1843 when there were on hand at the printers and the binders
    different endpapers, title-pages, half-titles and text pages already

  TYPESET: >-
    8vo, publisher's ¼ green cloth and blue paper-covered boards, very slightly
    skewed, scattered minor soiling; unclipped dust jacket, several old
    cellotape mends on top and bottom edges of verso repairing short closed
    tears and small nicks, moderate dust soiling and edge creasing; endpapers
    toned with some spotting. <i>First edition, inscribed by the author:</i> "G
    -- Recognize any of these events. We had fun. Dick." According to Rare Book
    Hub, the first signed or inscribed copy to appear at auction. It is surmised
    that the dedicatee is Richard Gillespie who was at Cornell University the
    same time as Fariña and Thomas Pynchon. The three shared the same residence
    in Ithaca and would have crossed paths frequently; Farina was known to have
    signed letters to his friends as "Dick." (For Richard Gillespie see:
    https://thomaspynchon.com/playing-bridge-with-thomas-pynchon/). The fact
    that the inscription is in red correction pencil suggests it was likely
    accomplished prior to his book signing at the Thunderbird book store in
    Carmel, California (the few copies he signed there were done in ink)
    whereafter, later that same day, 30 April 1966, two days after the novel's
    publication, he tragically died in a motorcycle accident. A 1960s American
    counter-culture desideratum.

    devotedly / Scott Fitzgerald." While the extent of their relationship isn't
    clear, Fitzgerald and Lundbergh did enjoy a correspondence, however brief
    (the laid in 1-page TLS on Princeton University Library stationery signed by
    Mr. Clark the Manuscripts Curator, dated 19 March, 1969, confirms
    Lundbergh's gift of 3 Fitzgerald holograph letters to him to be added to
    Princeton's Fitzgerald holdings). A letter from Fitzgerald to Maxwell
    Perkins (circa 1 March, 1929) includes a favorable mention of Lundbergh:
    "Will you watch for some stories from a young Holger Lundberg who has
    appeared in The Mercury? He is a man of some promise and I headed him your
    way" (Turnbull, ed., The Letters of F. Scott Fitzgerald, NY, 1963, p. 214).

  TYPESET: >-
    Half-title (mounted on stub); 3-page index at end. Small 8vo (6½ x 4¼
    inches; 170 x 110 mm), later ¼ morocco and marbled boards, spine ruled and
    lettered in gilt; pages age-toned, no markings. <i>A work of the utmost
    scarcity, the first Spanish edition of this translation, with no other
    examples appearing at auction</i> according to Rare Book Hub. This is the
    most important abridged version of Marx's Capital ever to have appeared.
    Superior to the edition, also published in Madrid, by Dionisio de los Ríos
    with a translation by Zafrilla, bearing an 1886 publication date, which is
    generally considered to be the first Spanish translation of Das Kapital, and
    deemed an inferior (also abridged) version from Roy's French version. OCLC
    locates four copies (British Library, Bibliothèque Nationale, and two in the
    United States). This Spanish translation was made from the French of Gabriel
    Deville (1854 -1940), the French socialist theoretician, politician and
    diplomat, who did more than almost anyone else to raise awareness of Karl
    Marx's theories of the weaknesses of capitalism, most effectively through
    the present work, which came to have a profound influence upon the spreading
    of Marxist thought throughout the Spanish speaking world. "The epitome, here
    translated, was published in Paris, in 1883, by Gabriel Deville, possibly
    the most brilliant writer among the French Marxians. It is the most
    successful attempt yet made to popularize Marx's scientific economics"
    (Robert Reeves La Monte, Introductory Note to the 1899 English translation).
    The Spanish translator of the work is Antonio Atienza, a typographer and
    translator at the press of Ricardo Fé, who in 1886 volunteered his work at
    the newly founded "El Socialista," the Spanish flagship publication of
    Marxist socialism. It was also in 1886 that Atienza translated the present
    work, with the publication following in 1887. This translation happened
    almost simultaneously with the problematic translation by Zafrilla, which
    appeared in weekly installments in the rival newspaper "La Républica."

    American edition, first state binding,</i> containing thirty-five passages
    and the Epilogue omitted from the English edition (published a month
    earlier). Melville himself famously described his book thus: "It is the
    horrible texture of a fabric that should be woven of ships' cables and
    hawsers. A Polar wind blows through it, and birds of prey hover over it."
    "[Melville's] great book, Moby Dick, was a complete practical failure,
    misunderstood by the critics and ignored by the public; and in 1853 the
    Harpers' fire destroyed the plates of all of his books and most of the
    copies remaining in stock (only about sixty copies survived the fire) ...
    Melville's permanent fame must always rest on the great prose epic of Moby
    Dick, a book that has no equal in American literature for variety and
    splendor of style and for depth of feeling" (Dictionary of American
    Biography XII, pp. 522-526). BAL 13664; Sadleir, Excursions 229; Grolier,

    compared with the Doves Bible and the Kelmscott Chaucer. A flower among the
