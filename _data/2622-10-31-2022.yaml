    (1890-1967) was born into an aristocratic family in Strasbourg (at the time
    a part of Germany) and studied painting in Paris, Cologne and Munich. In
    1917, she moved to Berlin and was introduced to the avant-garde Galerie der
    Sturm, which was the center of the modern art scene in the city. While in
    Berlin, she also met Rudolf Bauer (1889-1953), with whom she had a lifelong
    relationship.<br><br>Rebay was interested in non-objective art, a form of
    abstraction that was rooted in esoteric religious beliefs and philosophical
    ideas of intuition. She believed this form of art was a cure for a world
    ravaged by war and the burgeoning technological innovations that fueled
    materialism.<br><br>In 1927, she moved to New York and was commissioned to
    paint Solomon Guggenheim's portrait. She took the opportunity to encourage
    him to collect non-objective art and became instrumental in guiding
    Guggenheim's collection. When he founded the Museum of Non-Objective
    Painting (now the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) in New York, she was the
    first curator and director of the museum and chose Frank Lloyd Wright to
    design the now iconic building.

    Philippine sugar magnate, Ossorio (1916-1990) was one of the early
    practitioners of Abstract Expressionism, and in the 1950s he formed
    important artistic friendships with Jackson Pollock and Jean Dubuffet. They
    showed Ossorio the value of looking inward for inspiration, and his
    surrealistic imagery began to evolve into more abstract, outwardly
    expressionistic work.

    Drypoint and engraving printed in dark brownish black on white wove Italia
    paper, 1944-45.  300x250 mm; 12x10 inches, full margins.  Third state (of
    3).  From the Roman numeral edition of 10, aside from the Arabic numeral
    edition of 50.  Numbered V/X in pencil, lower right.  Printed by Emiliano
    Sorini, New York, with the blind stamp lower left, in 1967.  Co-published by
    Lee Krasner Pollock, Estate of Jackson Pollock, and The Museum of Modern
    Art, New York, with the Pollock Estate blind stamp lower left.  A very good
    impression of this extremely scarce, early print.<br><br>Only a few lifetime
    proofs of Pollock's etchings exist today.  Most of his intaglio work was
    printed posthumously from plates preserved in the estate, which are now in
    the collection of The Museum of Modern Art, New York.<br><br>Following is an
    account written by the printmaker Gabor Peterdi, who was entrusted with
    printing Pollock's surviving intaglio plates, "Shortly after Pollock's
    death, during the time when The MoMA was organizing the Pollock
    retrospective, I received a call from William Lieberman. He told me, they
    had discovered in Pollock's estate four plates in rather neglected
    condition--corroded, dirty, etc.--and they wanted to find out if they could
    be salvaged. Lieberman asked me whether I were willing to undertake this
    job.  As Lieberman and I had a longstanding professional association, and as
    I also felt strongly that Pollock's work should be saved if possible, I
    consented to try. <br><br>The four plates were in terrible condition, full
    of corrosion, with most of the drypoint flattened out. Further, the four
    plates contained six images, as two of the plates had images on both sides.
    This would create additional problems with printing. I cleaned the plates
    and reworked the drypoint on all six images. As I knew Pollock personally
    and worked together with him at Hayter's Atelier 17, I knew very well his
    own way of working so the restoration was no problem. <br><br>Then I printed
    up some proofs (before steelfacing) of all the images and gave one set to
    The MoMA.  At this time, I advised the museum that, after steelfacing, four
    of the images were sound enough to be printed in editions.  The other two
    were weak, underetched images with too much corrosion. So, you could say it
    was I who decided which images to print, based entirely on what was
    feasible. All this (cleaning, restoration, printing of proofs) was done by
    me in my studio in Rowayton, Connecticut. <br><br>I also recommended
    [Emiliano] Sorini to do the printing of the editions. Sorini had printed
    some of my own plates for me and, at that time, was teaching under my
    supervision in the Yale University printmaking workshop. Sorini made the
    prints in his own studio. I do not know who did the steelfacing. I had
    nothing to do with the choice of paper," (Gabor Peterdi, letter written
    March 13, 1987).<br><br>Pollock's (1912-1956) New York apartment was located
    opposite of Atelier 17 on East 8th Street and was frequented by other
    Abstract Expressionists such as William Baziotes (1912-1963) and Robert
    Motherwell (1915-1991).  It was here that Hayter instructed Pollock in the
    technique of drypoint and etching in the autumn of 1944. (Emmerling, Jackson
    Pollock: 1912-1952, p. 60).  Pollock tested his method of building up an
    image with interlocking lines and brushstrokes, for which he would become
    famous, through his experimentation with etching.  He reworked many of his
    etchings with ink and gouache; and in most cases, professionally printed
    impressions of his plates were not taken until after his death.

  CROSSHEAD: Untitled.
  TYPESET: >-
    Oil with paper collage on found board, with vintage reproduction print
    verso, 1956.  862x635 mm; 34x25¼ inches.  Signed and dated in oil, lower
    right recto.  <br><br>The current early work, was made by Stella (born 1936)
    while a student at Princeton University.  Stella had become acquainted with
    abstract art, and the work of Hans Hofmann and Josef Albers in particular,
    while attending high school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. 
    Later on, while at Princeton University and through frequent trips to New
    York during the mid-1950s, he became influenced by the abstract
    expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline. <br><br>According to a
    review in the Princeton Alumni Weekly, regarding an exhibition of Stella's
    early work ("1958": February 4, 2006-May 7, 2006, Arthur M. Sackler Museum,
    Harvard University Art Museums;May 26, 2006-August 20, 2006, The Menil
    Collection, Houston;September 16, 2006-December 31, 2006, Wexner Center for
    the Arts, Columbus) the author Mark F. Bernstein wrote, "Within 18 months of
    his graduation from Princeton, at a time in life when most of his classmates
    were sitting dully in law school classes or fumbling through their first
    jobs, Frank Stella [Princeton class of] ’58 was one of the most important
    artists in the world, a comet who exploded Abstract Expressionism in a
    series of black, almost brutally minimalist paintings that seemed, in the
    words of art historian Robert Rosenblum, to 'close the door on what art
    could do.<br><br>When Stella first arrived in Princeton in 1954, the
    University’s art department did not offer any drawing classes, which
    Stella--who majored in history--says suited him fine, as he had little
    interest in taking them. The following year, William C. Seitz, later a
    curator at the Museum of Modern Art, began to offer a noncredit, free-form
    drawing course that met, for lack of any other space, in the architects’
    work area at McCormick Hall.  According to Darby Bannard [Princeton class
    of] ’56, a close friend of Stella’s and a noted abstract artist, the
    architecture students resented having to share their space with painters and
    would sometimes deface their work, leave wet paint on work stools, or scrawl
    signs asking, 'Is this art?'<br><br>A year later, Stephen Greene was hired
    to teach Princeton’s first studio art class.  Greene, Stella recalls,
    'Taught in the traditional method.  You brought in a model, you draw the
    model, and after you do it for a while you can paint.  But I was kind of an
    annoying student. I didn’t want to paint from the model. I just wanted to
    make paintings.  So after a while [Greene] gave up and said, You’re
    incorrigible. Just go ahead and make the paintings and forget about an art
    class.'<br>Traditional, representational art bored Stella. 'I just thought I
    was too far behind' what was going on in modern art to waste time sketching,
    he says. [Willem] de Kooning and [Franz] Kline had been fighting Picasso for
    years to take older painting styles, such as Cubism, to a new level in which
    painting was entirely nonrepresentational and non-objective,' Stella says.
    'All of the painting that had developed from 1945 to 1950 had been a
    tremendous struggle to get through that and [the abstract expressionists]
    had come out on the other side. I wanted to start on the other side. I
    didn’t want to have to fight a battle already won or
    lost.'"<br><br>Provenance: Gift from the artist to Sigurd G. Waaben,
    Princeton, a friend of the artist, as a wedding present, Waaben was a
    student at The Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, at the time, and a
    hobbyist artist; thence by descent to current owner, private collection, New
    Jersey.

    when the Old Masters of Abstract Expressionism were just starting to make
    major prints in New York.  The artist, his wife, and his new dealer, Xavier
    Fourcade, grew concerned that De Kooning [1904-1997] was entering the print
    market too quickly and with too many prints.  Therefore, the seven completed
    editions [including the current work] went into storage while long-range
    commercial options were considered.  When De Kooning and Fourcade finally
    decided to enter the print market in a serious manner, five years later, the
    decision was made to release only the new editions developed and published
    by Knoedler.  As a result, these seven editions remained unsigned,
    unpublished and virtually unknown.  The first printed reference to any of
    these seven prints, the most important lithographs he made between 1960 and
    1970, did not appear until 1990."  Graham 42.<br><br>Provenance: The printer

    Castelli.  A very good impression.<br><br>Bontecou (born 1931) is an
    American sculptor and printmaker originally from Providence, Rhode Island. 
    She was exposed to construction and assembly by her parents who both worked
    in war implements manufacturing.  From a young age, Bontecou expressed an
    interest in drawing and sculpture and after studying academic painting at
    the Art Students League, New York, from 1952 to 1955, with artists such as
    George Grosz (1893-1959) and William Zorach (1887-1966), Bontecou discovered
    her passion for sculpture.  She spent two years in Rome in the late 1950s on
    a Fulbright Scholarship, where she delved deeper into sculpture and began
    welding.  She also developed a novel technique using an acetylene torch to
    create large drawings made of soot, which she called
    "worldscapes."<br><br>On her return to New York, Bontecou began creating
    mounted abstract wall sculptures, for which she gained acclaim.  Leo
    Castelli organized her first solo exhibition at his gallery in 1960, and the
    Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, bought one of her works the
    following year.  The art critic and philosopher Arthur Danto described
    Bontecou's work as lying "at the intersection of magnified insects, battle
    masks, and armored chariots."  Her sculptures from the 1960s, which she is
    best known for, impart an organic and mechanistic sensibility that conjure
    fear and terror of the unknown and the inexpressible.  Field 12.

    Sylvester, John Chamberlain: A Catalogue Raisonné of the Sculpture
    1954-1985, 1986, page 44, number 3 (illustrated).<br><br>According to
    Sylvester, this sculpture was made by Chamberlain (1927-2011) very early in
    his career in Chicago; it is his first sculpture made from steel
    rods.<br><br>Rena Rosequist (born Rena Furlong, 1931-2019) was born in
    Hickory, North Carolina and attended the Women's College of the University
    of North Carolina, where she was exposed to the work of young modern
    artists, like Jackson Pollock (1912-1956).  After graduation, she attended
    the progressive Black Mountain College and continued her studies in art and
    art history.  During her time at Black Mountain College, Rosequist met her
    first husband, poet Joel Oppenheimer (1930-1988), who attended until 1953.
    By 1955, Chamberlain (1927-2011) had followed friend and fellow artist,
    Gerry van de Wiele (born 1932) from the Art Institute of Chicago to Black
    Mountain College, where Chamberlain would meet Rosequist (Chamberlain
    attended Black Mountain College from 1955 to 1956).  Eventually Oppenheimer,
    Rosequist, and Chamberlain migrated to New York, and though Oppenheimer and
    Rosequist divorced by 1960, Rosequist and the itinerant Chamberlain kept in
    touch.  Rosequist moved to Taos, New Mexico and operated Mission Gallery
    with her second husband, Ivan Rosequist from 1962 to 2017.<br><br>According
    to Gagosian Gallery, New York, which has represented the estate of John
    Chamberlain, "In the mid-1940s Chamberlain spent nearly three years aboard
    an aircraft carrier while serving in the US Navy.  Traveling through the
    Pacific, Mediterranean, and Atlantic greatly influenced his sense of scale
    and viewpoint.  Following his return to the United States, he studied at the
    Art Institute of Chicago (1951–52) and then at Black Mountain College in
    North Carolina (1955–56), where he fostered a keen appreciation for poetry
    and began to consider language as an integral part of his aesthetic
    approach.<br><br>Chamberlain moved to New York in 1956 and the following
    year made Shortstop, his first sculpture incorporating automobile parts. He
    continued to use this material, revealing the seemingly infinite formal
    potential of the shining chrome, flaking paint, hard edges, and voluminous
    folds. In 1961 his innovations led to his inclusion in the 'Art of
    Assemblage' at New York’s Museum of Modern Art, where his sculptures were
    shown alongside Futurist, Surrealist, and Cubist works.<br><br>At the end of
    the 1960s Chamberlain began to incorporate galvanized steel, urethane foam,
    and mineral-coated Plexiglas into his work.  Despite the physical
    differences of these materials, Chamberlain was consistent in his approach,
    constantly searching for the right 'fit' and rearranging compositions until
    they 'locked into place.<br><br>Chamberlain returned to the nearly exclusive
    use of automobile parts in the mid-1970s, expanding his technique by cutting
    and painting the metal.  Seeking a larger studio space with higher ceilings
    where he could expand the scale of his work, he moved from New York to
    Sarasota, Florida, in 1980. There he made the Gondolas (1981–82), long, low
    works often displayed in pairs or groups on the floor, like abstracted boats
    floating in a row.  For the Giraffe series (1982–83), he sandblasted painted
    car metal, removing the color in patterned, linear strips to reveal the raw
    surface beneath.<br><br>Chamberlain is considered among the most important
    and influential 20th century sculptors, his dynamic work blends Abstract
    Expressionism, Pop Art and Minimalism, and can be found in public
    collections worldwide, including the Centre Pompidou, Paris; the Hirshhorn
    Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; the Moderna Museet,
    Stockholm; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Tate Modern, London;
    the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and the Museum of Modern Art,

    the artist to Rena Rosequist, 1984; thence by descent to current owner,
    private collection, New York. <br><br>Rena Rosequist (born Rena Furlong,
    1931-2019) was born in Hickory, North Carolina and attended the Women's
    College of the University of North Carolina, where she was exposed to the
    work of young modern artists, like Jackson Pollock (1912-1956).  After
    graduation, she attended the progressive Black Mountain College and
    continued her studies in art and art history.  During her time at Black
    Mountain College, Rosequist met her first husband, poet Joel Oppenheimer
    (1930-1988), who attended until 1953. By 1955, Chamberlain (1927-2011) had
    followed friend and fellow artist, Gerry van de Wiele (born 1932) from the
    Art Institute of Chicago to Black Mountain College, where Chamberlain would
    meet Rosequist.  Eventually Oppenheimer, Rosequist, and Chamberlain migrated
    to New York, and though Oppenheimer and Rosequist divorced by 1960,
    Rosequist and the itinerant Chamberlain kept in touch.  Rosequist moved to
    Taos, New Mexico and operated Mission Gallery with her second husband, Ivan
    Rosequist from 1962 to 2017.

    Terra cotta sculpture, circa 1975.  220x220x105 mm; 8¾x8¾x4¼ inches.  With
    the artist's signature incised on the verso.<br><br>Nakian (1897-1986) often
    depicted classical mythology in his abstracted sculptures, and returned to
    themes such as Leda and the Swan and Europa and the Bull repeatedly.  He met
    and befriended painters Arshile Gorky and Willem de Kooning in the 1930s and
    Marsden Hartley and Marcel Duchamp in the 1940s. The famous poet, Frank
    O'Hara was the curator of a major Nakian retrospective at The Museum of
    Modern Art, New York, in 1966 (where the artist was also exhibited in
    1930).  In the exhibition catalogue, O'Hara noted: "Nakian is unrepressed,
    un-neurotic, unabashed in his approach to sensuality, however tortuous his
    esthetic commitment, and whether his subject be death, bestiality, or
    Arcadian dalliance.  This explicitness gives the Nymph and Satyr plaques a
    marvelous joy and ease, the Europa terra-cottas a voluptuous dignity, and
    the Leda and the Swan drawings an almost comic abandon.  Unlike most
    sexually oriented images in modern art, from Auguste Rodin to Andy Warhol,
    one finds no guilt or masochism in a Nakian.  It is outgoing and athletic
    even in its releases and defeats: the satyr, the bull, the swan, the goat
    are each circumvented or absorbed by the goddess of his choice in the most
    choice of circumstances, that of his own choosing, like the amorous 'dying'
    of the Elizabethans or the Metamorphoses of Ovid."

    initially came to New York by way of California, to pursue acting and dance,
    which she studied at the University of California, Los Angeles.  She
    enrolled at the American Academy of Art in New York, but her travels in 1925
    throughout Europe, where she saw works by Picasso and Matisse, convinced her
    to change course and pursue a career as an artist.  She studied for several
    years at the Art Students League and there met the American modernist
    sculptor David Smith, whom she married in 1940.  Similar to his interests,
    she explored more progressive art forms, adhering to abstract and cubist
    tendencies rather than simply representational imagery.<br><br>The couple
    moved to Bolton Landing, a farm outside New York City, where, unfortunately,
    Dehner's art was secondary to her duties as a wife (Her painting Life on the
    Farm serves as a psychological reflection of the mundanity then).  The
    couple separated in 1950 and divorced two years later.  Dehner resumed her
    career as an artist, studying printmaking at Atelier 17 and returning to her
    much beloved medium of sculpture.

    York, at the Pratt Institute, the Art Students League, the Hans Hofmann
    School of Fine Arts and Columbia University.  Studying with Hans Hoffmann,
    McNeil shared a studio with Lee Krasner and through her met Jackson Pollock,
    Willem de Kooning and Esteban Vicente.  In 1936, McNeil and a group of other
    artists formed the American Abstract Artists. They painted in a geometric
    cubist style, though at the same time McNeil was beginning to create a
    different expressionist kind of art.  He painted full time, but with the
    outbreak of World War II McNeil spent time in the Navy.  After the war, in
    1946, his first regular job was teaching at the University of Wyoming in
    Laramie.  He continued to teach throughout his career and ultimately became
    director of the Pratt Institute's evening program.<br><br>During the 1950s,
    McNeil's style was fully abstract and he began exhibiting at the Egan
    Gallery, New York.  At this time he was associated with the other artists
    who exhibited at the Egan Gallery such as Willem de Kooning, Philip Guston,
    Franz Kline and Jack Tworkov, with Kline a close friend.  He exhibited in
    the first "Ninth Street Show (9th Street Exhibition)" in 1951, the watershed
    New York School Abstract Expressionist show, and also exhibited in five of
    the subsequent "New York Painting and Sculpture Annuals" at the Stable
    Gallery, New York through 1956.  From the early 1960s, his transition to
    Figurative Expressionism made him a clear precursor for the
    Neo-Expressionist movement of the 1980s.<br><br>Provenance: Private

    his work in Italy, mostly in Rome (he exhibited for the first time in Rome,
    at the Galleria del Cometa, in 1937), he also traveled to New York and
    California during the 1950s, teaching at Mills College in Oakland in 1957. 
    Afro's work was shown in an exhibition called "The New Decade: 22 European
    Painters and Sculptors," which toured the United States, and was also
    included at "documenta 1" in Kassel, Germany (1955).  In 1978 he was honored
    with a major retrospective at the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in
    Rome.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection, Chicago.

    Gouache on board, 1959.  191x241 mm; 7½x9½ inches.  Signed and dated in
    pencil, lower left recto.<br><br>Stamos (1922-1997), born on Manhattan's
    Lower East Side to Greek immigrants, famously posed with his fellow
    first-generation Abstract Expressionists, James Brooks, Mark Rothko, Jackson
    Pollock, Robert Motherwell (and others), in the 1950 issue of Life
    magazine.  This issue referred to the group as "The Eighteen Irascibles"
    because of their protest of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's policy towards
    American painting in the 1940s.  Though not as widely known among the
    Abstract Expressionists, Stamos operated in a similar manner using
    earth-toned paints that suggest biomorphic imagery in his large-scale
    paintings.<br><br>On the occasion of Stamos' 1947 exhibition at the Betty
    Parsons Gallery, New York, friend and fellow artist Barnett Newman wrote in
    the catalogue introduction: "His ideographs capture the moment of totemic
    affinity . . . the pastoral experience as one of participation with the
    inner life of the natural phenomenon."  <br><br>Provenance: Private

    Private collection, New Jersey.<br><br>Diller (1906-1965) explored the
    concept of tension between planes of movement in his works.  Within this
    concept, he separated his works into three visual themes: "First Theme"
    works were comprised of geometric shapes floating on a flat plane; "Second
    Theme" works, perhaps Diller's most ambiguous category, were compositions
    "generated by continuous lines"; and "Third Theme" works were of tight
    intersections, counterpoints, and "linear interplay".  Though enumerated,
    Diller noted that the themes do not evolve or devolve into one another and
    are not fixed categories.  Diller had announced these themes in literature
    accompanying his exhibition at the Rose Fried Gallery, New York in 1951,
    though as Barbara Haskell noted in the 1990 text for Diller's Whitney
    retrospective, "Although helpful in identifying images, they inadvertently
    caused later errors in titling, since most of Diller's work was executed
    without reference to specific themes."

    crayon, verso.<br><br>Newell (1914-2006) was a self-taught artist born on
    Manhattan's Lower East Side.  His paintings are typified by richly-hued
    geometric forms in subtle juxtapositions and textures, heightened by an
    intimate scale and striking color harmonies.  He participated in the Group
    of American Abstract Expressionists and was a founding member of the Eighth
    Street Club, which also included Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky and Franz
    Kline.  Newell was not a prolific painter; his works number less than 100
    and were often executed over decades, as he constantly refined his
    compositions with new colors until satisfied with the result.  Due to their
    continued reworkings, many of his paintings were up to an inch thick when
    completed, with a combined depth of wood support and layers of meticulously
    applied paint.<br><br>From January 18-March 9, 1996, Woodward Gallery, New
    York, hosted Newell's largest gallery exhibition to date, "Roy Newell:

    full margins.  Signed and numbered 248/250 in pencil, lower margin.  A very
    good impression.<br><br>Homage to Barnett Newman is based on a series of oil
    paintings made by Davis (1920-1985) completed after the death of the artist
    Barnett Newman (1905-1970).  According to the Marsha Mateyka Gallery,
    Washington, D.C., which has represented the artist's estate since 1997, this
    series is "All characterized with split compositions of two subtly
    contrasting flat gray panels, a white stripe dividing the two and sharply
    contrasting thin stripes finishing the edges on each side.  Gene Davis first
    saw the work of Barnett Newman in 1951 at the Betty Parsons Gallery in New
    York.  Of the Newman influence, Gene Davis remarked on the 'quality of
    clarity that seemed absent in abstract expressionism' and 'his [Newman's]
    use of the free standing stripe'."

    artist who worked in a wide variety of media.  She was American art pioneer
    in light art and luminist sculpture, known for her neon, steel, aluminum and
    acrylic glass installations.  She worked from the mid-1950s in New York City
    studios and worked since 1992 in the studio she established in Neos Kosmos,
    Athens, Greece.  She was among the first artist to work closely with neon
    light, and in 1966 debuted The Gates to Times Square, a 10x10x10 feet cube
    installation consisting of two mammoth letter "A"s through which visitors
    walked into a gleaming block of stainless steel and Plexiglas enhanced by
    pale blue neon light controlled by programmed timers.  First shown at Pace
    Gallery, New York, it entered the collection of the Albright-Knox Art

    margins.  Initialed and numbered 209/250 on adhesive label, verso, as
    issued.  Printed by Henry Deckner, Cologne.  Published by Verein
    Progressiver Galerien, Cologne.  A very good impression.  <br><br>Twombly
    (1928-2011) was born in Lexington, Virginia, to parents who hailed from New
    England. At the age of 12, he began taking art lessons with the Catalan
    Modernist painter Pierre Duara, who had relocated to Lexington for the
    duration of the war. From the late 1940s through the early 1950s, Twombly
    studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Art Students
    League, New York; and Black Mountain College in North Carolina, which at the
    time was the epicenter of the American avant-garde. During these years of
    schooling he came in contact with artists such as Robert Rauschenberg,
    Jasper Johns and Robert Motherwell (who taught him at Black Mountain
    College). He fostered close relationships with some of his contemporaries
    (most notably Rauschenberg and Johns), but his acutely personal style meant
    that he was perpetually on the fringe of the art world.<br><br>Twombly
    traveled to Europe and North Africa with Rauschenberg (with whom he was
    intimately involved at the time) in 1952, before being drafted to the army
    the following year. Twombly returned to New York after receiving a medical
    discharge and worked in a studio near Rauschenberg and Johns (the three
    artists would become known for breaking away from the ideals of Abstract
    Expressionism and adopting their own distinct styles). Between 1953 and
    1957, Twombly was regularly showing at Stable Gallery in New York before
    switching to Leo Castelli Gallery. His work during this time was mainly
    black and white, notably influenced by Franz Kline.<br><br>He sojourned
    again to Europe in 1957, and spent several months in Italy. Rome would
    remain his home base for the remainder of his life. Twombly's move to Italy
    wasn't simply a change of scenery, it was a distinct and deliberate turning
    away from New York, which had become an artistic epicenter due to the
    emergence of Abstract Expressionism. Rather than adopt the AbEx aspiration
    for an almost ahistorical viewpoint, Twombly's work was all-encompassing,
    embracing history, literature, language and setting, often combing words and
    images to evoke not only personal memories but a collective history. In
    Italy, his work became less gestural and more minimalist, as he was
    profoundly influenced by the Mediterranean light and the Classical history
    surrounding him.<br><br>This image, which harkens to Twombly's celebrated
    "blackboard" paintings from the late 1960s/early 1970s, so-called for their
    resemblance to a classroom chalkboard, was published in support of Art
    Cologne, or the Kölner Kunstmarkt, an international contemporary art fair
    established in 1967 and regarded as the world's oldest art fair of its
    kind.  Bastian 28.

    recto, and the top envelope and envelope wrapper signed, dated and annotated
    in ink.<br><br>Provenance: Collection of the artist, Captiva Island,
    Florida; gifted to a friend of the artist; Soulis Konstantinidis, the artist
    and art gallery owner of Soulis Art Gallery, Captiva Island, Florida, and
    Athens, Greece; sold to private collector, Athens; thence by descent to the
    current owner, Athens, Greece.<br><br>After touring Europe and North Africa
    with Cy Twombly (1928-2011), Rauschenberg (1925-2008) re-emerged in New York
    in 1953 to develop his Combine works, which blended three dimensional
    everyday objects with painting in collages that explored the gap between
    elevated fine art and daily detritus.  During this time Rauschenberg met
    Jasper Johns (born 1930), who had recently returned to New York from the
    U.S. Army.  Rauschenberg, who was exhibiting and working as a maintenance
    man at Eleanor Ward's Stable Gallery helped Johns gain footing in the art
    world.  The two artists were professional and romantic partners for six
    years.  In 1954, Johns helped Rauschenberg create one of his first Combines,
    Minutuae as a prop for a Merce Cunningham performance.  It was through
    another Combine, Short Circuit, 1955, that Rauschenberg featured a
    reproduction of one of Johns' flag paintings.  In 1957, Leo Castelli met
    Johns while visiting Rauschenberg's studio and offered to exhibit the
    younger artist's works.  In 1958, with concurrent shows at Castelli and
    Cornell University, the two artists' popularity rose, however their
    important collaboration and profound mutual impact on each other's works
    during these formative New York years can't be
    understated.<br><br>Rauschenberg's career blossomed during the 1960s, with
    numerous ground-breaking gallery and museum exhibitions, both in and around
    New York and internationally.  He purchased the Beach House, his first
    property on Captiva Island, in 1968.  However, the property did not become
    his permanent residence until the fall of 1970.  Rauschenberg worked from
    his home and studio on Captiva Island throughout the 1970s, focusing on both
    printmaking and related original works using natural fibers found in fabric
    and paper.  During this time he created the Hoarfrost (1974–76) and Spread
    (1975–82) series; the latter featured large stretches of collaged fabric on
    wood panels.  Rauschenberg created his Jammer (1975–76) series using
    colorful fabrics inspired by his trip to Ahmedabad, India, a city famous for
    its textiles.  International travel became a central part of Rauschenberg's
    practice after 1975 and through the 1990s and early 2000s he continued to
    evolve his artistic process and experiment with new materials such as steel
    and mirrored aluminum, transferred digital inkjet photographic images to a
    variety of painting supports, and biodegradable dyes and pigments. 
    Rauschenberg is considered both a seminal American contemporary artist,
    whose early works such as the current watercolor and collage anticipated the
    Pop art movement, and a prolific creator, whose unparalleled, experimental
    creative streak spanned more than half a century.

    edition of 3000 on the undersides.  Published by Rosenthal, Hamburg.  Each
    with the original paperboard box.  <br><br>In June 1990, Lichtenstein
    (1923-1997) began work on the same-titled screenprint series on stainless
    steel, revisiting his homage to the Impressionist artist Claude Monet which
    he started in the late 1960s with his Cathedral and Haystacks series. 
    Additionally, Frederic Tuten, writer and friend of the artist, said of the
    project "One might see this strategy as the culmination of Lichtenstein's
    long meditations on reflections, which began in the earliest of his Pop Art
    work," (see Corlett 261-66).

    Brush and ink on cream wove paper, 1956.  271x312 mm; 10¾x12¼ inches. 
    Signed and dated in ink, lower right recto.<br><br>Oldenburg (1929-2022) the
    Swedish-born American sculptor, best known for his public art installations
    featuring large replicas of everyday objects, created the current drawing
    during his early adult years in New York, where he initially worked in the
    library of the Cooper Union Museum for the Arts of Decoration.  He had
    originally come to New York, the son of a Swedish diplomat, and then studied
    in Chicago (in 1953 became a naturalized citizen of the United States). 
    During the late 1950s in New York, he met a number of artists, including Jim
    Dine, Red Grooms and Allan Kaprow, whose happenings incorporated theatrical
    aspects and provided an alternative to the abstract expressionism that had
    come to dominate much of the art scene.  Oldenburg began toying with the
    idea of soft sculpture in 1957, when he completed a free-hanging piece made
    from a woman's stocking stuffed with newspaper.  By 1960, he had produced
    sculptures containing simply rendered figures, letters, and signs, inspired
    by the Lower East Side, New York neighborhood where he lived, made out of
    materials such as cardboard, burlap, and newspapers; in 1961, he shifted his
    method, creating sculptures from chicken wire covered with plaster-soaked
    canvas and enamel paint, depicting everyday objects--articles of clothing
    and food items.  By the mid-1960s he decided to move to Los Angeles, as a
    means to escape the New York art world, and soon after began to make
    drawings for and ultimately create the large scale sculpture of everyday
    objects for which he is best known and which aligned him with the Pop Art
    movement.<br><br>Provenance: Acquired directly from the artist by the
    photographer Marvin Newman (born 1927), New York; Newman had visited
    Oldenburg's Lower East Side studio and purchased the drawing directly from
    the artist, who needed the funds to restore his studio electricity, which
    had been switched off due to his failure to pay the electric bill.

    Etching on Twinracker Handmade white wove paper, 1989.  252x225 mm; 10x9
    inches, full margins.  Signed, dated and numbered 48/80 in pencil, lower
    right.  Printed at Wellington Studios, London.  Published by George Mulder
    Fine Arts, New York.  From the same titled portfolio.  A very good
    impression with strong contrasts.<br><br>The Valley is a collaboration
    between Haring (1958-1990), who made 16 separate etchings for the series,
    and the Beat Era poet and novelist William S. Burroughs, whose text-based
    "cut-up" method of writing influenced Haring’s pictographic style. 
    Reflecting a shift from Haring’s more light-hearted early works, The Valley
    series is dark and menacing, made during the final years of his life when he
    was living with AIDS.  Alongside his Apocalypse series (1988), this series
    introduces stylistic shifts of more complex compositions and characters such
    as jesters, masks, skills and martyrs.  This series tells the story of the
    valley people who live in hellish conditions, then rescued by people from
    the outside world.  Haring and Burroughs set up an "us" and "them" narrative
    in this series, notably around contamination from the valley people.  Thus,
    The Valley series strikes parallels with contemporary crises like the AIDS
    epidemic and functions as a compelling social commentary.<br><br>A portion
    of Burroughs's corresponding text for this etching reads: "The Press, of
    course, wallowed in speculation and clamored to be allowed to interview the
    Valley people and take pictures. They were firmly admonished that the
    possibility of a virgin soil epidemic imposed emergency conditions.  No one
    but scientists and doctors from the CDC would be allowed access to the
    Valley people, unless or until there was no danger of an unknown disease
    agent getting loose in the world’s population."  Littmann, page 141.

    and oil pastel on wove paper, circa 1975.  1020x642 mm; 40⅛x25¼
    inches.<br><br>Amar (1954-2001) was born in Casablanca, Morocco in 1954 to a
    Sephardic Jewish father and a Spanish mother before immigrating to Toronto,
    Canada in 1957. Although his family could not afford much, Amar was
    surrounded by the arts in his childhood. In 1974, he received the Dorothy
    Reid Scholarship to attend Ontario College of Art but later quit after only
    a few years to commit himself to his own studio and practice. After several
    successful gallery exhibitions in Toronto, Amar and his wife moved to
    Brooklyn, New York in 1979, although he would periodically return to Toronto
    to teach classes at the Ontario College of Art. In New York, he became
    exposed to New York-based artists such as Willem de Kooning, Barnett Newman,
    Jackson Pollack and Mark Rothko. His works from the 1970s onward combine
    Abstract Expressionism with a unique dialogue with Minimalism, a style
    dominating the art world in the 1960s and 1970s. Robert Rauschenberg's
    "combine paintings" and Cy Twombly's gestural scribbled works were also of
    particular interest and influence on Amar.  <br><br>Provenance: Private

    completed two major sets of lithographs with the Curwen Studio during her
    lifetime. The Aegean Suite was inspired by the Hepworth's visits to Greece
    and its ancient sites. Hepworth began the suite in 1970 from her studio in
    St. Ives and completed it with the master printer Stanley Jones MBE at the
    Curwen studio in Tottenham Court Road, London the following year.  Although
    Hepworth's graphic output was limited, she enjoyed printmaking as the
    intricacy of its layering process would allow her to develop ideas on space,
    abstraction, form and texture that she would later translate into her
    sculpture.

    known as Mimi) (1923-2015) was a Canadian-born artist based in the United
    States.  She was a painter, sculptor, printmaker, and a pioneer of feminist
    art.  She is also considered a leader of the Pattern and Decoration art
    movement.  Schapiro's artwork blurs the line between fine art and craft. 
    She incorporated craft elements into her paintings due to their association
    with women and femininity.  Schapiro's work touches on the issue of feminism
    and art: especially in the aspect of feminism in relation to abstract
    art.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection, Massachusetts.

    Galerie Lelong, Paris.  Red and gold decorated silk portfolio case.  Superb
    impressions of these scarce prints.<br><br>According to The Museum of Modern
    Art, New York, Louise Bourgeois, The Complete Prints and Books online
    catalogue, Metamorfosis is a collaboration initiated by Maria Fluxà, a
    Spanish gallery owner and collector.  Fluxà first encountered Bourgeois’s
    (1911-2010) work at the 1982 MoMA retrospective and felt a particular
    emotional connection to the Femme Maison.  She then began enthusiastically
    collecting Bourgeois’s work, which she displayed in her gallery, Lluc Fluxà,
    in Palma de Mallorca. Taking inspiration from Bourgeois's themes of memory,
    identity, and trauma, Fluxà also staged a performance at her gallery titled
    'Götterdämmerung' that dealt with her own upbringing.<br><br>In 1993, Fluxà
    met Bourgeois at The MoMA opening of a Joan Miró exhibition, introducing
    herself as an admirer and collector. She later visited the artist, which led
    to discussions about a possible collaboration between the two.  Bourgeois
    had a sympathetic response to Fluxà’s difficult relationship with her
    father, a problem she shared.  After meeting over the next several years,
    she agreed to participate in a collaborative work that became the
    illustrated book entitled, Metamorfosis.  Here, Fluxà creates a fusion of
    words and imagery that conflates her own identity with that of the artist. 
    Bourgeois allowed images of her work to contribute to this fusion, and also
    created five prints especially for the volume.  The portfolio was published
    by Galerie Lelong, Paris, in 1999.  MoMA, Louise Bourgeois: The Complete

    inches.<br><br>Clark, known as A-One (1964-2001) was born in Manhattan and
    grew up in the Mitchel Houses in the South Bronx.  He was the son of Janette
    Gordon Clark and the grandson of Mannie Clark Sr., head caddy at the Mayfair
    Golf Course in Sanford, Florida in the late 1950s.  He began painting at the
    age of six, and writing graffiti on subway cars during the mid-1970s.  A-One
    joined Rammellzee's (1960-2010) graffiti crew Tag Master Killers, which also
    consisted of Delta2, Kool Koor, and Toxic.  Each member designed their own
    style for arming letters based on Rammellzee's theory of Gothic Futurism,
    which describes graffiti as the weaponization of letters in a battle to
    reclaim language from a "diseased culture" of social control.  In the early
    1980s, they were among the graffiti artists bringing original art and music
    from the Bronx and Queens to the downtown art scene.  In 1982, A-One, Toxic,
    and Kool Koor participated in the group show "Camouflaged Panzerism" at
    Fashion Moda in South Bronx.<br><br>A-One was a friend and collaborator of
    artist Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-1988).  Basquiat became his mentor and
    guided him toward art gallery representation.  A-One is the subject of two
    of Basquiat's paintings: Portrait of A-One A.K.A. King,1982, and Anthony
    Clark, 1985.<br><br>Provenance: Purchased from Gloria J. Gordon, the

  CROSSHEAD: Untitled.
  TYPESET: >-
    Acrylic, spray paint and collage on canvas, circa 1997.   1009x755 mm;
    39¾x29¾ inches.<br><br>Rammellzee (1960-2010) was a visual artist, gothic
    futurist "graffiti writer", painter, performance artist, art theoretician,
    sculptor and a hip hop musician from Far Rockaway, Queens, New York, who has
    been cited as "instrumental in introducing elements of the avant-garde into
    hip-hop culture."  Rammellzee's graffiti and art work are based on his
    theory of Gothic Futurism, which described as the battle between letters and
    their symbolic warfare against any standardizations enforced by the rules of
    the alphabet.  His treatise, Ionic treatise Gothic Futurism assassin
    knowledges of the remanipulated square point's one to 720° to 1440°, details
    an anarchic plan by which to revise the role and deployment of language in
    society.  Rammellzee's performance art included self-designed masks and
    costumes of different characters which represented the "mathematical
    equation" that embodied the artist himself.  On the basis of his Gothic
    Futurism approach, he described his artistic work as the logical extension
    into a new phase which he called Ikonoklast Panzerism.  Rammellzee's work
    can be found in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and
    the Museum of Graffiti, Miami. <br><br>Provenance:  Acquired directly from
