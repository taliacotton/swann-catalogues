    Rare color-printed kawaraban depicting Russian Admiral Yevfimiy Vasilyevich
    Putyatin's squadron entering Osaka Bay in late 1854. <br><br>In the wake of
    American Commodore Matthew Perry's successful opening of Japan in 1853,
    Putyatin sailed into Osaka attempting to gain an audience with Shogunate
    officials. After a brief stay, Putyatin found himself ushered from Osaka and
    was requested to continue to Shimoda where a meeting of diplomatic
    negotiations would be arranged. As the fleet sat anchored at Shimoda on
    December 23, 1854, a tremendous earthquake struck the area causing a tsunami
    which destroyed the fleet and damaged the flagship Diana's hull beyond
    repair. With a collaborative effort between the Russians and local Japanese
    carpenters a schooner was built in a matter of months that was large enough
    to carry Putyatin and his crew back to their homeland. This was the first
    western-style ship built in Japan and an early instance of Japanese learning
    western technology, models of which were quickly incorporated into their own
    naval fleets. <br><br>Before departing, Putyatin and Japanese officials
    negotiated the Treaty of Shimoda, ending Japan's centuries-long policy of
    international isolationism. The treaty opened Japan's ports to Russian
    commerce and defined the northern territorial borders between the two
    Empires.

    references we've consulted cite the variant pocket version seen
    here.<br><br>In the present plate quite a few engraved differences can be
    found when compared to the 1845 guide version: a different script is used at
    the title; Mollhausen's name does not appear; our reference key notes 71
    locations versus 80; a larger explanation and scale table is here;
    riverfront treatment differs; and frankly on closer inspection one realizes
    this is an altogether different plan covering less area and with less
    toponym detail, features which lead us to surmise it was separately
    published and pre-dates the "first" guidebook edition. <br><br>Jumonville,

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Separately published first issue of a map which was subsequently re-engraved
    to be included in Melish's 1813 "Military and Topographical Atlas of the
    United States". <br><br>As Melish writes on page 3 of that work: "The first
    map in the list is The Seat of War in North America. Previous to the
    declaration of war, the author had travelled extensively in the north and
    west parts of the United States, collecting authentic information regarding
    the present state of the country, and had moved to Philadelphia to put his
    travels to press. Knowing how unsatisfactory topographical and statistical
    information is without good maps, particular attention was paid to select
    the best and most authentic maps in the country, from which to construct
    those for the travels. While engaged in drawing them, a much valued friend
    [Henry Schenck Tanner] suggested the propriety of drawing a general map of
    the seat of war, and proffered the use of a very ample set of excellent maps
    in his possession. Of these, the author gladly availed himself; the map was
    produced, and immediately received the stamp of public approbation. It sold
    so rapidly, that the first plate was soon worn out, and a new one has since
    been brought forward, enlarged and much improved."<br><br>The present map is
    slightly smaller and significant differences of engraving can be seen when
    compared to that of the version found in the "Atlas". This edition not in
    Phillips.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Russian Admiral Yevfimiy Vasilyevich Putyatin played an instrumental role in
    negotiating commercial relations between Japan and Russia. The Treaty of
    Shimoda, signed in 1855 between the two empires, opened Japan's ports to
    Russian commerce. <br><br>In late 1854 Putyatin arrived with his squadron at
    Osaka Bay causing a great panic among the Shogunate, as related in this
    contemporary document. The Russians were shortly thereafter directed on to
    Shimoda for a more comfortable setting to hold diplomatic negotiations. On
    December 23, 1854, the day prior to a planned meeting with Shogunate
    officials, a massive earthquake hit the area causing a great tsunami which
    destroyed the Russian ships. Local Japanese tradesmen worked together with
    the Russians to build a new boat large enough to sail Putyatin and his crew
    back to their homeland. This was the first western-style ship built in Japan
    and an early instance of Japanese learning western technology. The vessel,
    dubbed "Heda", was completed in a matter of months and after finalizing the
    trade treaty in spring 1855, the Russians dispatched for home.

    "Album of 1897" in ink on front pastedown: the drawings are generally
    skillful for a child's hand and include portraits, architecture, arbor,
    still-life, fashionable hats, furniture and home furnishings, nursery
    rhymes, seasonal allegories, birds, animals, and other late 19th-century
    subjects. <br><br>The names of Alma-Bertha Bertsch and Margarethe [sic]
    Bertsch appear at separate places in large stylized calligraphy. The two
    sisters were born in New York City in 1885 and 1887 respectively. Their
    younger brother, Karl Alfred was born in 1889; one of the drawings depicts
    an age-appropriate boy wearing a sailor's uniform and cap lettered "Karl".
    Alma Bertha spent her career as an educator and real estate broker in New
    York City; Marguerite also started off as a school teacher but for a brief
    period in the mid-to-late 19-teens she enjoyed an occupation as a
    screenwriter and silent film director with Vitagraph Studios, a prominent
    early 20th-century Brooklyn production company.

    A pseudo-re-imagining of Benjamin West's famous 1770 painting, "The Death of
    General Wolfe," which depicts a pivotal event of the French and Indian War.
    The composition is quite different from West's, but the prone figure of
    Wolfe cradled by his compatriots is certainly familiar. However, the
    sub-caption reading "du Regiment des Licaniens à l'attaque du Closter Boisig
    dans la campagne de 1778. 1. Le Prince de Ligne, Field Marechal Lieutenant.
    2. le Prince Charles, Son Fils et Son Adjudant Lieutenant au Corps du Genie"
    would seem to place the figures of this scene more accurately within the
    context of the 1778 War of Bavarian Succession. <br><br>The print is
    unusually rare, we find no copies in OCLC, and none at auction since an 18
    October 1912 Puttick & Simpson sale, "Death of Wolfe, by J. Clarot,
