  at-a-glance: ''
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Acquired directly from the Estate of David Berjman; to a Private South
    American Collector.


    Chambi's fine photographs were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, New
    York from March 23-May 3, 1979. A successful portrait photographer, he
    operated a commercial studio in Cuzco for decades, where he sold
    carte-postale-size photographs. His poignant studies, which captured the
    handsome features of native peoples in the studio and in the field, were
    complemented by a longstanding interest in ancient Incan culture. 


    His panoramic and detailed views were the focus of an artistic project that
    occupied Chambi for decades. The prints were created independently on site,
    and produced as medium-format photographs.


    The album was compiled and presented to R. Beyman and commemorated a
    conference celebrating Peru and its range of ancient to colonial-era
    architectural splendors. 


    The album is organized into distinct sections, and each of the photographs
    is carefully captioned. The photographs corresponding to the first three
    categories are credited or attributed to Salazar, an accomplished commercial
    photographer whose fine aesthetic and technical mastery integrate seamlessly
    with Chambi's refined visual sensibility. The album is composed of the
    following sections:
     
    I. Peru, Lima. With 45 photographs, comprising 7 of artifacts associated
    with the Machica, Chanka, Chavin, Huacos Muchik, Nazca, and Rukaba cultures
    that are housed at the Museo de Antropoligia and 38 exterior and interior
    views of churches, palaces and lavish "casas," and street scenes in Lima; 

    Pages 4 through 49.


    II. Peru, Ruinas de Pachacamac, Cajamarquilla, Pisas. With 8 detailed views
    of these remarkable prehistoric sites and ruins, including scenes of workers
    excavating. Pages 50 through 58.

    Merced, and varias casas. With 11 views by Chambi.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    From the Mendocino Lumber Company; to Judge William Vaughn, Mendocino; then
    gifted to Emery Escola, Mendocino; by descent to the Present Owners.


    In 1863, Carleton Watkins traveled to Mendocino, California. Though there is
    little documentation surrounding this trip, it is likely that Jerome B.
    Ford, superintendent of the Big River Mill, may have been the impetus for
    Watkins' trip to the area. With the growing lumber industry, Ford may have
    wanted to photograph his burgeoning lumber business. His home is also
    depicted in Watkins' works from this period. Watkins' approach of traveling
    to photograph client commissions and taking additional images of the area
    for commercial sale, may have originated from this trip. 


    Mendocino's first sawmill, the Gang Mill, was financed by Henry Mieggs at
    the mouth of the Big River in 1852. The mill was supervised by Jerome Ford
    and E.C. Williams, and they opened a second mill, Big River Mill, in 1854.
    The Gang Mill, which is depicted in this group, closed four years after the
    construction of the Big River Mill. The company was founded by Mieggs as the
    California Lumber Manufacturing Company (1852-1855) and after undergoing
    financial difficulties in 1855, it was run by Ford and Williams but renamed
    the Mendocino Lumber Company (1855-1872). Though undergoing changes in
    ownership and company names, the sawmills continued operation until 1938. 
     
    This group of Watkins' photographs of Mendocino includes photographs of the
    city's coastal buildings, depictions of the mills along the Big River,
    including the original Gang Mill and the Big River Mill, and astounding
    landscape views looking out onto the Big River and Mendocino Bay. Of note
    are two images of the Big River Mill, one likely taken earlier in October
    1863 of the mill and another of the debris of the same mill, which was taken
    after a fire destroyed the mill on October 17, 1863.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The Sokol movement is an all-age gymnastics organization first founded in
    Prague in the Czech region of Austria-Hungary in 1862. It was based upon the
    principle of "a strong mind in a sound body." The Sokol, through lectures,
    discussions, and group outings provided physical, moral, and intellectual
    training for the nation, including men of all ages and classes, and
    eventually women. The Sokol played an important part in the development of
    Czech nationalism and patriotism, which found expression in articles
    published in the Sokol journal, lectures held in the Sokol libraries, and
    theatrical performances at the gymnastic mass festivals called slets.


    This mass festival was held in June 1948, the first to be held since 1938
    and the last to be for some time after the Communists assumed leadership
    earlier that year. The Czech women's gymnastic team went on to win the gold
    medal at the London Olympics later that summer.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Though the cyanotype process was invented in 1842 by Sir John Herschel, the
    height of is usage occurred around the turn of the 20th century. A
    printing-out process, the negative (or object) would be placed in contact
    with a sensitized sheet and exposed to daylight, creating a rich Prussian
    Blue in the exposed areas. This straightforward process was adopted by
    industrial photographers, which may relate to the cyanotype's usage as a
    reproduction process for technical drawings or illustrations by architects
    and engineers. This group of cyanotypes depicts various delivery and freight
    vehicles. Likely taken for automotive companies to exemplify their vehicles,
    the richly toned prints emphasize the characteristics of the automobiles as
    well as their signage.

    A vintage print by the great photojournalist made while on assignment in
    Switzerland. Eisenstaedt made some significant images during this 1932 trip,
    including the iconic shot of the skating waiter. Although several images
    from St. Moritz were reprinted by Eisensteadt in the late 1970s, this
    negative was never, or rarely, revisited. This warm, vintage photograph has
    been in the same collection since the 1940s. The sweet image of a young boy
    checking his reflection embodies Eisenstaedt's humanist, compassionate eye,
    and offers a range of beautiful tones and textures.

    Rudy Burckhardt produced this photograph of Paris very early in his career,
    shortly before emigrating from Switzerland to New York in 1934. Settled in
    Lower Manhattan, Burckhardt took the same street aesthetic he used in Paris
    and applied it to the excitement of New York. Robert Frank, his compatriot,
    would attack New York with similar gusto on his arrival in 1947.
    Burckhardt's New York photographs from 1937-40 were the subject of the
    Metropolitan Museum exhibition New York, N. Why?: Photographs by Rudy
    Burckhardt (2008). Vintage prints by Burckhardt from Paris are unknown to
    the market.

    said about this image, "Suddenly I saw a lovely young society girl sitting
    next to an empty box. From that box I took another picture with the girl in
    the foreground. For years and years this has been one of my prize
    photographs. Without the girl I would not have had a memorable picture."

    Charles Peterson was a former jazz guitarist, who became a jazz
    photographer, and is now remembered as the first to candidly document
    musicians at work. His photographs appeared in numerous publications,
    including Time, Life, Town and Country, Esquire and Down Beat, capturing the
    debut of Benny Goodman's first band at the Roosevelt Grill, the first jam
    session between Tommy Dorsey and Louis Armstrong backstage at the Paramount

    Edward Steichen, who encouraged his work, and Peterson took a year to study
    at Clarence White's school.

    John Collier Jr. was a pioneer in the fields of visual and applied
    anthropology. At 12 years old, he apprenticed under Maynard Dixon, then
    married to Dorothea Lange. Following this experience, Collier began working
    as a freelance photographer in New Mexico and California, and he was hired
    by Roy Stryker to be part of the FSA project in 1941. Rather than continuing
    his photography in the Southwest, Collier was sent to New England to
    photograph rural communities. This period, in turn, led to his intense
    interest in anthropology and the connection between people and the land.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    As a young child, Bourke-White's father took her to the steel foundry that
    was forging his printing presses. She recounted in her 1963 autobiography,
    "To me at that age, a foundry represented the beginning and end of all
    beauty…[it] was so vivid and alive that it shaped the whole course of my
    career."


    In 1927, after a sporadic college education and a failed marriage,
    Bourke-White moved to Cleveland. One of her early assignments was
    documenting the inner workings of the Otis Steel Mill where her interest in
    the subject matter drove her to capture the molten lava in such a detailed
    and dramatic manner that the varnish on her camera would often blister. She
    also would use the fabric from her dress as a focusing cloth over her
    camera.


    Bourke-White's ability to endow a sense of drama and romance to these and
    other formidable steel structures would make Bourke-White a nationally
    recognized photographer by the end of the 1920s and for decades following.

  at-a-glance: ''
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Working at the prismatic intersection of art and science, Wilson Bentley
    became the first person to photograph a single snow crystal in 1885 by
    adapting a microscope to a bellows camera. Capturing over 5,000 images of
    delicately-rendered "ice flowers" in his lifetime, Bentley discovered the
    now commonly-known fact that no two snowflakes are the same. (He was also
    the first American to measure raindrops.)


    Deeply committed to his work, Bentley wrote, "Under the microscope I found
    that snowflakes were miracles of beauty; and it seemed a shame that this
    beauty should not be seen and appreciated by others. Each crystal was a
    masterpiece of design; and no one design was ever repeated [...] I became
    possessed with a great desire to show people something of this wonderful
    loveliness, and ambition to become, in some measure, its preserver."

    <D>From Vintage Works, Ltd.; to Swann Galleries; acquired by a Private
    Collector, in 1993.


    In 1935 Edward Weston relocated to Santa Monica Canyon, near the Los Angeles
    beach. The setting would inspire his series of Dunes photographs, a total of
    48 different images depicting the shifting soil formations along the
    California coastline.


    Gradated sand intersecting with an illuminated sky highlight the dunes in
    Oceano, which appear in a constant state of flux, effortlessly changing form
    in a mystical dance. A painterly scene results, as Weston's tender approach
    to the landscape left reality untouched. The dimensionality that results
    invokes continuous movement, capturing not a still image but one in
    perpetual transition.


    Weston's Guggenheim Fellowship application describes the formalist approach
    he employed in Oceano, in which he searches specifically for natural beauty,
    shying away from recreating his surroundings to capture a preconceived
    image. "I do not retouch nor manipulate my negatives in any way. I use no
    artificial light. I do not enlarge; which means that I use an 8x10 camera,
    and present an untrimmed version of my original conception as seen on the
    ground-glass. All of which means that I am a 'purist'--believing that
    photography can have value only if it is honest, not imitating or competing
    with any other form of expression."

    Silver print, the image measuring 13⅜x10 inches (34x25.4 cm.), with Lange's

    Acquired from Paul M. Hertzmann, San Francisco in 2011; to a Private
    California Collector.


    Dorothea Lange believed strongly in the camera's ability to effect change
    and powerfully illustrate injustice and inequalities. Her images are both
    deeply empathetic and outraged, and her methods--open, instinctual,
    responsive, and intimate--created some of the most enduring and iconic
    images from the period. "Open yourself as wide as you can, like a piece of
    unexposed, sensitized material," she wrote. 


    In 1934, Lange attended a longshoreman strike in San Francisco. This
    impactful photograph of a police officer monitoring a crowd of protesters
    reflects the social and political unrest of the period. The officer's stiff
    pose and towering form partially obscure the placards and crowd behind him,
    though the young girl at the left of the frame gazing directly at Lange
    creates an intimate moment of human connection and understanding. 


    In a critique about her work, fellow photographer Willard Van Dyke stated
    "Unlike the newspaper reporter, she has no news or editorial policies to
    direct her movements; it is only her deeply personal sympathies for the
    unfortunate, the downtrodden, the misfits, among her contemporaries that
    provide the impetus for her expedition." (<i>Camera Craft</i>, October 1934)

    Though Evans originally intended to start his career as a writer, he took up
    photography and employed literary techniques to create his powerful, often
    narrative imagery. In 1935, Evans was asked by the government to photograph
    one of their resettlement communities for the Department of the Interior.
    This led to his hiring by the Resettlement Administration. Working under Roy
    Stryker, Evans photographed rural towns, creating architectural images of
    churches and roadside stores, as well as striking portraits of farmers and
    sharecroppers.

    President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps in 1961. After
    Kennedy's assassination, President Lyndon B. Johnson launched his War on
    Poverty initiative, signing the Office of Economic Opportunity Act. This
    legislative initiative would eventually provide job training, work study
    programs, loans and grants to poor farmers, and a domestic volunteer service
    that cooperated with local governments and communities. Programs such as
    VISTA, Job Corps, Community Action Program, and Head Start all fell under
    the OEO administration, which was dubbed the domestic Peace Corps.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    While in Staunton, Virginia, for an industrial photography job in 1955,
    Link's longstanding love of railroads became focused on the nearby Norfolk
    and Western Railway line. N&W was the last major (Class I) railroad to make
    the transition from steam to diesel motive power. Link took his first night
    photograph of the road on January 21, 1955, in Waynesboro, Virginia. On May
    29, 1955 the N&W announced its first conversion to diesel and Link's work
    became a documentation of the end of the steam era. He returned to Virginia
    for approximately 20 visits to continue photographing the N&W, taking his
    last shot in 1960. That year the road completed the transition to diesel, by
    which time he had accumulated 2400 negatives on the project.


    Link's images were meticulously set up and posed, and he chose to take most
    of his railroad photographs at night. He said "I can't move the sun — and
    it's always in the wrong place — and I can't even move the tracks, so I had
    to create my own environment through lighting." Link's vision required him
    to develop new techniques for flash photography of such large subjects. 


    In addition to photographing them, Link was also making sound recordings of
    the trains, which he issued on a set of six gramophone records between 1957
    and 1977 under the overall title <i>Sounds of Steam Railroading</i>. In the
    railfan world he was probably best known by these, and by photographs
    published in Trains magazine and elsewhere in the 1950s, which inspired
    others to follow his example.

    From a Private Chicago Collection. <br>During World War II, Cartier-Bresson
    escaped a prisoner of war camp after being held captive for three years.
    Subsequently he returned to the United States to prepare an exhibition of
    his work at The Museum of Modern Art. The exhibition catalogue <i>The
    Photographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson</i> was published in 1947 and contained
    essays by Lincoln Kirstein and Beaumont Newhall. According to Peter Galassi:
    "Beaumont and Nancy Newhall had begun work on the exhibition during the war,
    before it was known that Cartier-Bresson had survived; thus the photographer
    had the rare opportunity of participating in his own 'posthumous'
    exhibition."<br>

    Often best recognized for his moody black and white photographs, Ed van der
    Elsken was one of the first Dutch photojournalists to embrace color
    photography, having begun photographing in color in the early 1950s. Much of
    his work after 1960 was made in color. This family portrait, which features
    a self-portrait of van der Elsken in the mirror, was taken in 1954, shortly
    after the signing of a cease-fire agreement between France and Vietnam and
    is one of his earliest images using color photography.

  at-a-glance: ''
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Provenance: the Estate of Andy Warhol; to the Private Collection of
    Frederick W. Hughes; gifted to the present owner in 1992. 


    The magazine <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> commissioned Andy Warhol to do a layout
    for an arts feature in 1963, marking the beginnings of a three-year
    obsession with the format. The photo booth, a space designed both for mass
    entertainment and, with it's neatly drawn curtain, for privacy, allows the
    sitter to adopt or perform a chosen role, each captured in a single frame.
    The resulting strip is like a snippet of film footage, one that is both
    performative and secrative. Serial, mechanical, the photo booth easily
    intersected with Warhol's aesthetic of passivity, detachment, and celebrity.
    Warhol commissioned or appeared in hundreds of photo booth portraits.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    From the Collection of Harriet Lyons, a founding editor of <i>Ms.
    Magazine</i>, journalist, and art collector.<br><br>By 1970, Lyons had been
    involved with a consciousness-raising group of art professionals, which
    included curators, artists and art historians. In 1971, she wrote a cover
    story for the <i>Village Voice</i> about women's sexuality in art at a time
    when women were starting to challenge male definitions of art. A leading
    figure in the feminist movement, she supported female artists through her
    writing, personal art collection, and activism, which included being a
    member of the Board of Advisors to the New York Feminist Art Institute that
    launched in 1979.<br><br>Lyons recalled, in a 2005 Feminist Art Institute
    interview, "I wrote a cover story for the <i>Village Voice</i> about women's
    sexuality in art, women artists exploring sexual and female imagery. The
    whole idea and question of a unique female imagery has been posed. This was
    a time of guerilla tactics and street theater to break down barriers to
    women’s equality. Female artists were talking about where they were coming
    from and what their work was about. While these discussions could get
    heated, it never escalated to the behavior I had witnessed among male
    artists in the ‘60s, especially at post-openings loft parties. Liquored up,
    these guys would invariably come to blows arguing about art (and who was
    flirting with whose wife or girlfriend). The point is that women, too, had
    strong theories about art, and in the ’70s were finally raising their voices
    against the male definitions of art and the separation of fine art and craft
    (any work made by a woman that involved stitchery was 'craft'). Women were
    making huge breakthroughs and expressions in their art specific to women.
    The whole question of a woman's imagery was hotly debated. Clearly, the time
    had come to publicly address the male biases in art-making and how artists
    were educated. To that end, two members of our consciousness-raising group
    were behind pioneering institutions: The New Museum of Contemporary Art,
    founded by Marcia Tucker in 1977, and the New York Feminist Art Institute,
    spearheaded by Nancy Azara and launched in 1979. The latter came out of
    long, probing discussions of women's experiences in art education and the
    studio. Those who were trained at the Art Students League, School of Visual
    Artists, Parsons, RISD, the Philadelphia School of Art, all had similar
    experiences about how rigid the sense of what art was, what the techniques
    were, what the imagery was. They all expressed being very much reined in by
    this overwhelming male model. They never had female teachers. The only women
    they saw were models or other female students."

    Sidibé was a frequent attendee of the late night social scene in Mali during
    the 1960s and 1970s where he would photograph young men and women partying,
    posing, and dancing to Western music. Following the event he would process
    the film and print proof prints, which he mounted to a folder with the
    inscribed event date and individual inventory numbers. Party attendees could
    then place orders for the photographs. Through this form of documentation,
    Sidibé became a chronicler of the independence and transformation of Mali.
