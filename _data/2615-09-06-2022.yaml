    First edition, first issue. After creating his most important paintings in
    the American West in the early 1830s, Catlin had been giving public lectures
    on his paintings in Great Britain from 1841 onward, sometimes with a group
    of American Indians in what was essentially one of the first Wild West
    shows. For this seminal portfolio of large-format lithographs, he selected
    what he felt were the 25 most popular images from his shows. "In The North
    American Indian Portfolio, Catlin immortalized those scenes that would
    become forever associated with life on the Great Plains--buffalo, buffalo
    hunting, galloping horses, bronco riding, and roping"--Reddin, Wild West
    Shows, page 43. <br><br>Catlin first issued these 25 plates with printed
    captions bound with the 20 pages of introductory text. Later issues put out
    by Bohn or Chatto & Windus were variously either mounted on card without
    captions, or had six extra plates, or had only 16 pages of text. A lovely,
    well-preserved copy. Abbey Travel 653; Field 258; Howes C243 ("c"); Sabin

    extensive revisions in the author's hand and by inserted typescript notes.
  at-a-glance: '[New York: C. Scribner''s Sons, 1909], with manuscript notes circa 1914'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Adolphus W. Greely (1844-1935) is best remembered as the leader of the
    1881-1884 Lady Franklin Bay Expedition, which successfully explored
    Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic, but also resulted in the
    unpleasant deaths of most of his crew. Greely recovered to command the
    Army's Signal Corps, and supervised the construction of an elaborate
    telegraph network in Alaska in the first years of the 20th century. In
    conjunction with that project, he authored this extensive Handbook of
    Alaska, which went through four editions in his lifetime, 1909, 1914, 1919,
    and 1925. Offered here is his personal copy of the 1909 first edition, with
    his extensive revisions made in preparation for a new edition. <br><br>All
    four editions of the Handbook are available on Hathitrust, allowing for easy
    comparison. The first three editions seem to have been produced from
    stereotype plates, with the only substantial differences seen in the title
    pages and prefaces, and all coming to 280 pages in the main body. The fourth
    edition is 330 pages. <br><br>The text contains dozens of corrections in
    three forms: handwritten on the original pages, handwritten pieces tipped
    in, and typewritten pieces tipped or laid in. These revisions appear to have
    been made to pages from the 1909 first edition, with notes frequently
    referencing data and events through 1913. Greely's intent was apparently to
    have these revisions reflected in the 1914 edition, but the main body of
    text in the second edition was simply reproduced via stereotype plates from
    the first. The publisher may have decided that a complete resetting of the
    type was not cost-effective. Not until 1925 was Greely able to publish a
    complete revision of the text, but the changes seen here are unevenly
    reflected in the 1925 edition. Page 45 contains a revised partial sentence
    on a typed slip which is ignored in the 1925 revision, with the chapter
    moved to later in the book on page 140. Many more substantial revisions can
    be seen, ranging from added paragraphs to completely revised tables and
    charts. The table of mountains and volcanoes on page 268 has heavy revisions
    on a duplicate sheet, while a summary chronology on page 260 has a whole
    additional typescript and manuscript sheet extending it through 1914. In
    short, these are edits for an early revision of the text which was never
    published. <br><br>Arctic Bibliography 6112; Smith 3824. Provenance: an old
    typescript description from an unknown dealer promises "We purchased this
    from a descendant, directly out of family storage."

    "Ledger art" self-portrait by the Sioux leader Crow Dog, made during his

  TYPESET: >-
    in an autograph book kept by a local resident during and after the trial.
    [75] manuscript pages. Oblong 12mo, 4 x 7 inches, original embroidered cloth
    with printed title "Aldine Album" produced in 1878, minor wear; minimal wear
    to contents.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    In August 1881, the Brulé Sioux subchief Crow Dog (1833-1912) shot and
    killed tribal police commander Spotted Tail, who had been handpicked by
    federal authorities and was regarded as an accommodationist. The facts of
    the killing were not disputed; in accordance with Sioux custom, Crow Dog
    made restitution to Spotted Tail's family and the matter was regarded as
    settled. However, the federal Indian agent pressed charges, and Crow Dog was
    brought to trial in Deadwood, SD in March 1882. The jury pronounced him
    guilty, but the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction,
    ruling that as the killing took place on tribal land, the federal government
    had no jurisdiction. The ruling remains of seminal importance to Indian law
    today. <br><br>This autograph album dates to 12 March 1882, during the
    trial. Standing out among these inscriptions is a hand-colored drawing in
    ink and colored pencil which represents Crow Dog on horseback killing a
    mounted rival. Behind him is a representation of his name: a crow riding on
    the back of a dog, linked by a line to Crow Dog's head. The drawing is done
    in the well-documented ledger art style which was commonly practiced among
    the Plains Indians during this period. <br><br>In addition, the volume
    contains dozens of signatures from the key figures in the trial: jurors,
    bailiffs, attorneys, and more. 15 of the Sioux witnesses signed by mark,
    with the marks made within calligraphic captions, including Spotted Tail Jr.
    One page contains the signatures of all 13 jurors, with names matching those
    listed in the 17 March 1882 issue of the Black Hills Daily Times, including
    one juror who was replaced due to illness, along with his replacement. The
    two court bailiffs also signed this page. 4 of the jurors also added fuller
    inscriptions on separate pages. 18 other South Dakota men also signed the
    volume, almost all of them dating their signatures in March 1882, including
    General John Cook; interpreter Charles Talkett; attorney Thomas E. Harvey;
    E.E. Corbin of the Sidney & Black Hills Stage Line; and Lead City newspaper
    editor Dolph Edwards. <br><br>The album is accompanied by a 2013 letter by
    the director of the Plains Indian Ledger Art Project, placing the drawing in
    historical context. This was one of at least three albums produced at the
    time of the Crow Dog trial, each with very similar Crow Dog drawings, and
    similar sets of witness signatures framed in the same calligraphic hand.
    Reproductions of the other two known drawings (one at Deadwood's Adams
    Museum) are included. A Black Hills Daily Times article dated 15 December
    1882 describes the creation of these drawings, explaining that the captive
    Indians would "while away their spare moments by filling out autograph
    albums for their pale-faced friends. . . . They generally draw illustrations
    of some valorous deed performed while at war with their natural enemies--the
    Crows and Pawnees." The same newspaper also noted: "Crow Dog's autograph is
    a very plain and comprehensive specimen of calligraphy. It consists of a
    crow riding on the back of a dog."<br><br>Several entries were made in the
    book after March 1882. The original owner made stops in Albuquerque, NM and
    Agua Fria, AZ in August 1882; Lynx Creek, AZ in May 1883; Prescott, AZ in
    1883; Jerome, AZ in May 1884; Arizona in December 1884 (where a fellow
    traveler signed "Snow bound, Black Hills, Yavapai Cn., Arizona"); Pine
    Cienega, NM in 1885; and Beaumont, CA in the fall of 1886. Three pages of
    entries are made in Chinese. <br><br>The album's compiler and original owner
    are not credited, but one entry by U.S. Attorney Hugh Campbell is addressed
    with "my highest respects to an independent and upright juror who dared to
    do his duty in face of a maudlin sympathy & a silly press." A list of
    witnesses near the rear of the volume in a distinctive tidy hand perfectly
    matches the signature and inscription by juror Frederick Ernest Bachelder
    (1846-1915) of Portland, SD, who may well have been the original owner. He
    signed the book with the inscription "Now is the time for hungry men to hang
    together." Bachelder spent most of his adult life in as a railroad clerk and
    newspaper editor in Clinton, Iowa but spent two years in the Deadwood area
    from 1880 to 1882 and returned to Clinton in 1884 (per Pierce, "Batchelder,
    Batcheller Genealogy" page 333). <br><br>Provenance: collection of the late

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Edgar Laplante (circa 1888-1944) was a con man from Central Falls, RI. In
    his longest-running scam, from about 1917 to 1926, he assumed the character
    of Chief White Elk (or sometimes Prince Tewanna Ray), and toured the world
    singing, dancing, and giving speeches on Indian rights. His purported tribal
    affiliation was generally left vague, although we find one reference to him
    as a "Cherikee." His wife Burtha Thompson often accompanied him, billed as
    "the Princess." He was imprisoned for fraud in both Switzerland and
    Mussolini's Italy. This is his own personal scrapbook kept as Chief White
    Elk, apparently maintained to demonstrate his credentials to the gullible.
    It is filled with photographs, testimonial letters, promotional broadsides,
    newspaper clippings, and more. Highlights: <br><br>A letter from the
    chairman of an American Red Cross chapter in California testifying that "Dr.
    Whitelk" volunteered during the influenza outbreak, "thinking not of himself
    but only of the welfare of the helpless who were left in his charge," 14
    November 1918. <br><br>Letters from the offices of the Treasury Department
    and Committee on Public Information addressed to Chief White Elk, thanking
    him for his patriotic endeavors, 1918. <br><br>A promotional photograph of
    William F. "Buffalo Bill" Cody with a quite possibly forged inscription,
    "With my best compliments to Chief White Elk, W. Cody, May 15th 1914."
    <br><br>A photograph of "Milton J. Thompson, my father-in-law" which ties
    the album to Laplante, although his born name appears nowhere in the album.
    <br><br>Certainly one of the strangest lots to pass through Swann's
    Americana department--and we have seen some strange ones.

    In 1775, Falmouth was a sprawling township in the northern section of
    Massachusetts which would soon become known as the District of Maine. The
    most populous section of Falmouth was "the Neck," which would be broken off
    as the city of Portland ten years later. Falmouth Neck was the site of
    considerable revolutionary action, including "Thompson's War," a standoff
    between the Royal Navy and a patriot militia in early May 1775. The present
    document was written in Falmouth shortly afterward to ensure loyalty among
    the "several hundreds on ye Neck." <br><br>"Agreeable to a resolve of our
    provincial Congress on the 8th of May ult'o, the Committee of Correspondence
    in this town, in order to know who are enemical to the rights of mankind and
    the interest of America, having proposed the following declaration of
    agreement to be sign'd by the inhabitants thereof, we the said inhabitants
    do heartily & cheerfully subscribe the same, viz: <br><br>We solemnly and
    sincerely declare that it is our opinion that the ministry of Great Britain
    and the Parliament have of late invaded the constitutional rights and
    liberties of this country by prosecuting their avowed design of raising a
    revenue here without our consent, as well as arbitrarily infringing our
    charter, and altering the civil government of this province, and therefore,
    to prevent a state of slavery, do sincerely and heartily agree and engage to
    do our utmost to carry into execution whatever measures have been or may be
    consistently recommended by the Continental and our provincial congresses
    for the purpose of opposing and frustrating those evil designs and for the
    preservation of our happy constitution, until a reconciliation between Great
    Britain and America upon constitutional principles can be obtained, which
    God grant may be speedily brought about, and that we will readily and
    heartily join our countrymen on all occasions in defence of our said rights
    and liberties as we trust our cause is righteous, and that we may succeed.
    We shall endeavor to oblige all persons to pay due obedience to the general
    resolves of Congress in particular, one for the regulation of the militia,
    to obey the orders of the several military officers who have been or shall
    be elected by the several companies and regiments, agreeable to the resolves
    of Congress, and to preserve peace and good order among ourselves and safety
    to the lives and properties of every individual among us." <br><br>This is
    not the original petition with signatures. Added in a different hand is a
    note: "This was signed by several hundreds on ye Neck, indeed all but the
    Custom House officers, Mr. Pagan, who gave ye committee a very handsome
    letter in excuse, and Mr. Courning[?], and I don't recollect any body except
    those who have left us. This method was agreed upon by ye committee to find
    out who were enemies, as the presumption was that those who were Tories &c

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Greenwich Island was an area of desolate swampland to the south of
    Philadelphia, requiring maintenance of dams and sluiceways to allow for a
    minimum of settlement and navigation. With the threat of British invasion of
    the new Continental capital, it may have gained some strategic importance.
    Here is a detailed accounting of work done on the island by William Jones
    from May 1776 to April 1777: "repairing the old sluice," "stoping leaks,"
    "laying in Keen's Bank to my hazard." The British took possession of the
    city in September 1777. Jones continued his work on the maintenance of the
    island's primitive infrastructure, adding one entry: "1778 April 17th to May
    16th, 59 days work mending banks & stoping leaks when the English was here."
    The British evacuated Philadelphia the following month. <br><br>Greenwich
    Island has since been filled, connected to the mainland, and incorporated
    into the southern part of the city; the Citizens Bank Park baseball field is
    built on what was once the island.

  at-a-glance: 'Various places, bulk 1885-1910'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Charles McMeen Kurtz (1855-1909) was a notable art critic and curator. Born
    and raised in New Castle, PA, he attended Washington & Jefferson College and
    the National Academy of Design, where he launched National Academy Notes,
    which ran through 1889. He rose to prominence as an assistant to curator
    Halsey Ives with the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, worked
    with the 1898 St. Louis Exposition, was Assistant Director of Fine Arts for
    the American exhibits at the 1900 exhibition in Paris, and served as art
    director for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904. In the last years of
    his life, he headed the Buffalo Arts Academy. <br><br>The collection
    includes 6 of Kurtz's annual diaries: 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1894, and
    1898, each with a few weeks or months of entries. In the earliest two
    diaries, he is a young journalist and curator in Manhattan, on the staff of
    the American Art Association (predecessor of Sotheby's New York), often
    reporting "no picture sold" or occasionally better news. On 14 January 1885
    he reported a sale to a celebrity minister: "Henry Ward Beecher in, bought a
    Chrisanthemum picture by Miss Buell, $75." He was a regular at exhibition
    openings and other art-related social events across town. In 1886 he
    mentions several visits to Bierstadt in May and June. The 1888 diary was
    written in Minneapolis. 17 January 1888: "First load of effects including
    painting left by sleds for St. Paul. . . . Went inside the walls of the
    burnt Universalist Church, all covered with ice formations of great beauty."
    1892 finds him in Chicago preparing for the Columbian Exposition. 30
    November 1892: "Prof. Ives and I had Japanese commissioners T. Tegima and Y.
    Yambe with us at University Club for lunch. Evening, I went to Palette Club
    reception where I engaged 2 pictures." 1894 finds him still in Chicago,
    packing up and shipping paintings from the Columbian Exposition. 2 January
    1894: "First lecture given at the new Art Institute Building. Crowded house,
    audience very kindly and appreciative." In May 1894 he arrives in Paris. In
    New York on 15 March 1898, he noted "Judy very much distressed by my
    recklessness in continuing to buy pictures in these bad times."
    <br><br>Kurtz's correspondence file includes many art world figures, such as
    French dealer Charles Sedelmeyer, German art dealer Adolf Paulus, Charles
    Ward Rhodes (Kurtz's assistant on the 1898 St., Louis Exposition), New York
    dealer Samuel P. Avery Jr., Louisville author Lydia Avery Coonley Ward (5);
    and artists Charles Sprague Pearce, Patty Prather Thum (3), Walter Appleton
    Clark, William Henry Howe, Edward Gay, William Anderson Coffin, Joseph
    Pennell, and Swain Gifford. Other letters are written to or from family
    members. 13 letters written by Kurtz are present, most to his sister Kate
    Wilder Kurtz (1875-1949) (they referred to each other as Nunky and
    Kick-Kick). <br><br>A packet on Kurtz's estate includes lists of art in his
    collection, and an auction catalog for its dispersal by Fifth Avenue Art
    Galleries in February 1910. Artists in his collection included Childe
    Hassam, Ralph Blakelock, and many more. Another folder contains memoranda
    relating to his art career: lists of his art loaned to institutions in
    Louisville in 1898, St. Louis in 1900, and Rochester in 1906; Kurtz's bill
    to John Wanamaker for curating a Mihály Munkácsy exhibition in Philadelphia
    in 1887; and a flier for a St. Louis Artist Guild meeting led by Halsey
    Ives. His notebook on the 1900 Paris exhibition includes notes on each
    nation's art halls ("Portugal: the less said the better"). <br><br>Other
    highlights include a minute book of the C.H. Art Circle of Louisville, KY,
    1906-1907 (connection to Kurtz unknown); a partial manuscript essay
    apparently by Kurtz titled "Impressions of the Primitives in Italy"; and an
    unpublished group of stories by Kurtz, "Five Stories Never Told Before, for
    Children of All Ages," in typescript with manuscript corrections, 1898.

    Small but substantial archive of Hugo Eckener, the Zeppelin company, and the

  TYPESET: 47 items in 4 folders; condition varies.
  at-a-glance: 'Various places, 1935-1938'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Hugo Eckener (1868-1954) led the Zeppelin operations from 1917 until he was
    sidelined by Hitler in the late 1930s, including Luftschiffbau Zeppelin and
    the American Zeppelin Transport Inc.; he also commanded the Graf Zeppelin
    airship on many voyages. This lot, from the papers of Eckener and his
    American-based assistant, captures the rapid decline of transoceanic airship
    travel in the wake of the 1937 Hindenburg disaster and deteriorating
    diplomatic relations. <br><br>Perhaps the highlight of this lot is a
    retained carbon of Eckener's letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt,
    dated Washington, 25 May 1937, accompanied by a 23 May hand-corrected draft.
    Writing just three weeks after the Hindenburg disaster, Eckener pleads for a
    supply of subsidized American helium to replace the highly flammable
    hydrogen fuel which had destroyed the Hindenburg. The successful airship
    industry had "with one stroke been checked by the disaster that befell the
    Hindenburg. . . . We must not assume the responsibility of continuing with
    our lighter-than-air merchant ships without the use of helium. It depends
    upon your Government, Mr. President, if it is prepared to enable us to use
    safe Helium, and . . . would represent a tremendous step forward in world
    traffic for the benefit of mankind." Eckener's quest for American helium was
    well reported in the press in May 1937, but this important letter appears to
    be unpublished. <br><br>Also included are 4 other personal Eckener items: 2
    fan letters written to him in 1937 and 1938; an invitation issued to Eckener
    by the Germania club at Dartmouth College in 1938; and an apparently
    unpublished piece of photostat sheet music, "Wings of Victory," dedicated to
    "Dr. Hugo Eckener, Air Ambassador," by Mona Reed of Cleveland, OH.
    <br><br>Also included are 9 letters and postcards addressed to Friedrich
    Wilhelm "Willy" Von Meister (1903-1978), a German immigrant to New York who
    acted as Eckener's personal representative, dated 1935-1938. One is signed
    by Eckener and others; one is a copy of a letter from the White House,
    thanking Eckener for the 1937 Zeppelin calendars. A Mr. Theilig thanks Von
    Meister for a complimentary trip aboard the Hindenburg from New York to
    Great Britain in July 1936, describing its pleasures at length: "While over
    the Hudson the ship rolled a few times very slightly. It was so little that
    I paid no attention to it. Afterwards I was told that that was the worst
    rolling the ship had ever done. . . . I felt that the first night on an
    airship was not made to go to bed early, so we enjoyed the company of a
    couple bottles guten Weines. . . . The whole matter feels so natural . . .
    the airship is really ready for the commercial field." Famed American
    airship captain Thomas "Tex" Settle wrote a 4-page letter in December 1935,
    expressing his hopes to retire from the Navy by 1940 "unless the Navy should
    experience a tremendous expansion" and jokingly asking "Will you give old
    Tex a job as office boy?" Settle has enclosed a photograph of the captains
    of his destroyer group in Haiphong. One envelope is addressed to von Meister
    on a Zeppelin Von Hindenburg illustrated cover. In addition, 5 other letters
    and postcards appear to be addressed to Von Meister as representative of the
    company. In October 1938, Charles E. Rosendahl (the captain of the fatal
    Hindenburg flight who survived the wreck) wrote from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii,
    hoping to write an article on the superiority of airships for trans-Pacific
    flight; this carbon copy was forwarded to "Willy" for response. <br><br>One
    folder contains 19 American newspaper and magazine clippings on Zeppelin,
    many of them gathered by a clippings service in 1938. Finally, an envelope
    of 7 pieces of ephemera includes a 1938 Lufthansa brochure; a maquette for a
    brochure for the Graf Zeppelin LZ130 airship in parallel English and German;
    a brochure and newspaper for Cleveland's 1936 centennial celebration; a
    photograph of a caricature of an NBC reporter aboard an airship; and an
    invoice for copper and rubber washers shipped by the Zeppelin company in
    1938. A ticket for a "Zeppelin Hindenberg Eckener Feier" was to be held by a
    New York German-American group on 10 May 1936. Taking place four days after
    the disaster, we feel safe in assuming the event was canceled.

    First edition of Webster's translation, one of the earliest American
    revisions to the King James version. Webster first conceived of updating the
    language of the Bible in 1822, but met with little encouragement. However,
    after the success of his 1828 Dictionary he revived the project with the
    mindset of producing a non-sectarian Bible to modernize archaic language,
    correct improper grammar and rectify mistranslations from the original
    Hebrew and Greek. He thought that "a version thus amended may require no
    alteration for two or three centuries to come" (Preface, page v). Hills 826;

    John Haile Jr. (1821-1903), a machinist who left his wife behind in Warren,
    RI to seek a fortune in the gold fields, was more articulate than the
    average Forty-Niner. This letter describes his passage around the horn, as
    well as conditions in San Francisco as he prepared to hunt for gold inland.
    This was apparently his first letter home. He describes using a spyglass to
    watch his wife at the Providence wharf as he sailed away: "I could see you
    all in Rhode's store, and with the glass very distinctly you was on the left
    hand side of the doorway." The ship was caked in ice as they rounded the
    Horn, and no fires were permitted aboard. "More than a hundred kegs of
    gunpowder were stowed in the run, and Capt. Allen preferred the cold to the
    danger of an explosion. . . . The termometer was down to 18, sometimes all
    the cabin pasengers would turn in, as we were confined below by the snow
    storms and cold rain." The ship stopped for nine days in Talcahuano, Chile,
    which he described as "the worst I was ever in, in all respects; immoral and
    homley." He describes a cabin boy who "fell overboard in the Atlantic, the
    ship sailing quite fast, but being an excellent swimmer and not alarmed was
    picked up while the birds were lighting on and about him. He received no
    injury." <br><br>In San Francisco, he noted the exorbitant prices for all
    goods, which were reported to be yet higher at Sacramento and points further
    inland. "Gold is plenty, but a great many will come home minus, because they
    have not got funds to get to the mines. . . . I shall push on immediately
    and build a log house in company with two others. . . . Thin clothing is of
    no use in this country. I shall not carry even one thin shirt, only woolen
    is of any account here. . . . Property is very safe, laying all about the
    streets and beaches. No one dares meddle with them as the penalty for theft
    is cropped ears. . . . Revolvers sell for six dollars, and guns are not
    worth taking care of, except for game. They have a regular form of
    government, and are preparing to come in to the Union as a state
    immediately. Frémont is here."<br><br>We have not learned whether Haile was
    successful in the gold fields, but he was reported back in Warren with Clara
    by the time the census-taker arrived in July 1850.

    Philipp Zimmermann (1826-1901) emigrated from Germany with his parents, and
    became a mechanical engineer in New York. He was the chief engineer on the
    S.S. California, the first steamship to pass through the Golden Gate in San
    Francisco in early 1849, shortly after the discovery of gold. <br><br>This
    journal was written on a later voyage of the California. It is written
    rather phonetically, with Zimmermann's heavy German accent shining through.
    It begins while docked in San Francisco on 28 October 1852, with Zimmermann
    trying to secure an order of bolts for crucial repairs in the frontier town.
    Shortly after departing for Panama on 1 November, the 3rd Mate fell
    overboard and drowned. He records a wide range of technical data on the
    ship's operations, such as steam pressure and revolutions per minute. A coal
    bunker fire is extinguished on 9 November, shortly after taking on coal at
    Acapulco. They arrived at Taboga Island off Panama for repairs on 16
    November, where he borrowed additional gear from other ships. Some men were
    sent ashore for leave on 21 November: "All of them came on boar and not one
    of them trunk. They all behaved themselfs lik gentleman. . . . It is a think
    I never seen befor, with so many man." They departed again for San Francisco
    on 22 December. Three men died of unknown causes at sea on 30 December, and
    the survivors arrived in San Francisco on 6 January. Zimmermann had time for
    bit of leave in San Francisco on 9 January 1853: "I and A. Wood spint the
    day togetter. We took a walk at a.m. on Tellygraft Hill. . . . We injoyed
    ourselves all day." Then the ship went up the bay to Benicia, CA, where they
    undertook more repairs (described in detail). <br><br>Zimmermann and the
    California left again for Panama on 16 February 1853. On 26 February, "2 off
    the coalpassers were fieding today, so I hade them put in irons." They
    arrived at Panama on 2 March, and headed back north six days later. The
    diary ends on 20 March 1853, with the ship nearly back to San Francisco.

    somewhat disappointed in their returns. I am at least. The luck of the Co.
    failing just at the time to catch me, who was the last in it, and to be the

    from 1894 and 1895 are signed as a member of the Arcade Sketch Club, which
    was founded in Pasadena in January 1894. The club made sketches of paid
    models. The 18 January 1894 Los Angeles Times states that they sometimes
    paid hoboes 50 cents for a sitting, and two March 1894 sketches in this lot
    appear to depict exactly that. Benshoff did not usually identify his

    sold to the short-lived firm of Morgan & Yeager and their Juvenile
    Bookstore, who kept the 1815 Charles title page but added their own undated
    printed wrappers. Other Morgan & Yeager imprints bearing dates are from 1824
    and 1825. To make this a bit more complex, the wrappers are backed with a
    piece of waste paper. It proves to be page 253 of Volume III of the Journal
    of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, issued in 1832, so we assume the
    wrapper was produced on or after that date. We trace no other examples of
    this re-issue of John Gilpin. Rosenbach 517; Welch 245.5 (both 1815 issue).

    Ko K'un-hua (1838-1882) was brought to Harvard in 1879, in the hopes that he
    could train a generation of students for success as China merchants.
    Enrollment in his classes was modest, with only 4 or 5 pupils. He died of
    pneumonia after almost 3 years at Harvard. The books he brought with him
    were Harvard's first in any Asian language, and formed the initial core of
    what became the Harvard-Yenching Library. After his death, Harvard offered
    no further instruction in Chinese for nearly 40 years.

    another old Lincoln friend, Ozias H. Hatch (1814-1893), then the Illinois
    Secretary of State. In the months between Lincoln's election and
    inauguration, Lucas offers Hatch the inside scoop. <br><br>"My opportunities
    of knowing what is going on, and also the public feeling, is quite as good,
    and I think better, than any ten senators or representatives. . . . They are
    standing in the midst of a revolution with folded arms, upon a baseless
    punctilio, when the very ground beneath them is crumbling away. They talk
    learnedly about the unconstitutionality of secession &c &c when he sees the
    secession of state after state and the withdrawal of members. They talk
    about coercion . . . How is it possible for one half the Union to coerce the
    other? Then it is plain that the thing is ridiculous. . . . Revolution rules

    for the proper course of action."

    Quartermaster, where he remained through the end of the war. <br><br>This
    notebook features a 63-page list of transportation requisitions for
    individual soldiers transported from Soldiers' Rest from 18 December 1862 to
    22 May 1863. More than 500 soldiers are named, along with their regiment and
    destination, sometimes with the name of the authorizing officer. Some are
    sent toward the front, while others are sent to their home towns for
    recruiting, leave or recuperation. Harper's Ferry and Fortress Monroe were
    popular destinations. Sometimes larger groups of deserters or paroled
    prisoners passed through. For example, on Christmas 1862, 28 paroled
    prisoners and 3 guards were sent to Annapolis, MD. <br><br>Following this is
    a quite evocative 7-page list of licenses granted to vendors operating in
    the camp from March to September 1864. They include salesmen of books,
    stationery, watches, songs, milk, pens, ointments, ice cream, soda water,
    oysters, ivory ornaments, stencil plates, pictures of Soldiers' Rest, and
    corps badges; as well as services including several bootblacks, a man

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Union cavalry colonel Ulric Dahlgren (1842-1864) and General Judson
    Kilpatrick launched a daring raid deep into Confederate territory on 28
    February 1864, in an attempt to enter Richmond. On 3 March, Dahlgren was
    killed and most of his small command captured. Found on his body were his
    orders to burn mills and boats en route to Richmond, and release Union
    prisoners held there: "The prisoners loose and over the river, the bridges
    will be secured and the city destroyed . . . & Jeff. Davis & cabinet killed.
    . . . Everything on the canal & elsewhere of service to the Rebels must be
    destroyed." Adding to the historical resonance, another doomed cavalry
    leader is mentioned in the closing sentence: "As Gen. Custer may follow me,
    be careful not to give a false alarm." <br><br>This captured letter and
    other documents quickly made its way up the Confederate chain of command,
    were circulated widely in the North and overseas, and remain one of the
    unsettled controversies of the war. Was this an authentic order or a forgery
    created for propaganda purposes? If authentic, how far up the Union chain of
    command did it go--was it a wild initiative of Dahlgren and Kilpatrick, or
    was Secretary of War Stanton involved, or did knowledge extend all the way
    to Lincoln? And what became of the Confederate file containing the original
    letter? It is often assumed that Stanton quietly destroyed the file shortly
    after the war, although no evidence exists. <br><br>While the letter was
    originally spread in transcript form, Union skepticism led Confederates to
    have photographic copies made for distribution. On 5 February 1864, Richard
    S. Sanxay and Adolph Gomert of Richmond, VA had received Confederate patent
    #227 for a "Photographic Process for Duplicating Maps." Working together at
    the Confederate Photographic Engineer Bureau, they produced numerous maps
    for battlefield use. By 23 March 1864, the Richmond Sentinel was announcing
    plans to photograph Dahlgren's plans and distribute them in Europe. On 1
    April 1864, Robert E. Lee wrote to Union General Meade about the Dahlgren
    Affair, hoping to determine whether the plan to assassinate Davis had
    official sanction: "To enable you to understand the subject fully I have the
    honor to inclose photographic copies of the papers referred to, one of which
    is an address to his officers and men, bearing the official signature of
    Colonel Dahlgren, and the other, not signed, contains more detailed
    explanations of the purpose of the expedition and more specific instructions
    as to its execution." Sanxay and Gomert billed the Confederate Engineer
    Service for making more than 200 copies of "Dahlgren's letter" between 16
    April and 1 June. The present copy is headed in manuscript "Photographed in
    office Top[ographical] Dep't D.N.V. [Department of Northern Virginia], Capt.
    H.H. Campbell, P. Engrs. in charge, Sanxay & Gomert's Patent." On verso, it
    is docketed "Photographic copy of instructions &c from originals found upon
    the person of Col. U Dahlgren U.S.A."<br><br>The alleged Union plot to
    assassinate Jefferson Davis has often been credited as a major factor in the
    radicalization of Confederate-leaning actor John Wilkes Booth. These
    photographs were the means by which that news was disseminated--and thus can
    be linked to the Lincoln assassination. The photographed letter and its
    importance are discussed extensively in Ron Field, "Silent Witness: The
    Civil War through Photography and its Photographers," pages 371-6, 458. See
    also the recent first biography of Dahlgren, Eric Wittenberg's "Like a
    Meteor Blazing Brightly," pages 200-201, 213, 242-7, which argues for the
    authenticity of the orders, and traces only two surviving photographs: at
    the National Archives and the Virginia Historical Society. <br><br>This may
    appear at first glance to be a later photostat, but it is an important
    artifact from 1864, with contemporary inscriptions. We trace no other copies
    of the famed Dahlgren letter at auction.

    three Arkansas battles, the small Battle at McGuire's Store, the Battle of
    Pea Ridge, and the 28 December 1862 Battle of Van Buren. Three days after
    Van Buren, on New Year's Day, he had these cards printed: "Maguire's!

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    On the first morning of the Battle of Gettysburg, 1 July 1863, the Union
    Army's 1st Corps was buckling under the Confederate onslaught northwest of
    the town center. As they fell back to Cemetery Ridge, the 16th Maine
    Infantry was given an impossible task: hold their position at any cost, to
    slow down the Confederate advance and guard the Union retreat. They were
    soon surrounded and overwhelmed. Shortly before they were captured, the
    color guard tore up the blue and gold regimental flag, distributing pieces
    among the troops so the Confederates could not enjoy it as a trophy.
    <br><br>This view shows the 16th Maine shortly before they were overwhelmed.
    They are gathered in a tight semi-circle reminiscent of Custer's Last Stand,
    with saber-wielding officers issuing commands from within the circle, and
    dead and wounded comrades on all sides. In the foreground, a Union
    artilleryman and his horse lie dead beside a cannon. The much larger
    Confederate force, charging from the left, has suffered losses as well.
    Several other Confederate units can be seen far in the background, advancing
    without resistance. The "16th Maine Vols." battle flag and the Stars and
    Stripes are still waving proudly at the front of the Union line. <br><br>The
    painting is signed only "C.F.L." It does not seem to be copied from any
    other view, nor do any other depictions of the battle seem to be copied from
    it. While it could not have been sketched from life, it seems likely to have
    sprung from the memories of a 16th Maine participant. The only member of the
    regiment in 1863 whose initials match C.F.L. was Cherbury Fitzalan Lothrop
    (1838-1936), a farmer from Chesterville, ME who enlisted as a sergeant and
    mustered out as a 1st Lieutenant. He was taken prisoner at Gettysburg. After
    the war he ran a country store in Chesterville through 1890, was active in
    veteran affairs and his church choir, was a Baptist minister, and taught at
    the Maine Central Institute. He retired to his daughter's home in Everett,
    MA in the early 20th century. At Gettysburg, Lothrop was a first sergeant. A
    first sergeant is a focal point of the composition, holding his rifle with
    its butt to the ground just within the circle behind the battle flag, and
    coolly surveying the fighting. <br><br>The landscape is similar to the
    actual site of the 16th Maine's last stand. Their monument stands today on
    Doubleday Avenue in Gettysburg, near the present Doubleday Inn. Looking west
    from the road are rolling hills in the mid-ground, framed against larger
    hills in the background. The hills are not a perfect match, but some areas
    are now forested which may obscure the actual view. The artist may have
    painted the scene from memory, or visited the battlefield later in life to
    make sketches. <br><br>Provenance: this painting was owned circa 1978 by the
    Argosy Book Store, whose proprietor Ruth Shevin made a photograph still held
    in the reference files at the Winterthur Library in Delaware. Winterthur
    independently made the same attribution of Cherbury Lothrop as the likely
    artist. The painting was apparently sold to the consignor's mother between
    1978 and her passing in 1981.

    This sketchbook was the work of Private John Richard (1831-1889) during the
    closing months of the war. While recovering from wounds suffered at
    Antietam, he apparently had some freedom to travel; the volume includes
    views of Washington, Alexandria, Baltimore, Annapolis, Hampton Roads,
    Appomattox, and Mount Vernon. The massive Union base at City Point, VA (a
    major supply hub, and site of Depot Field Hospital) appears frequently.
    Numerous naval steamships are depicted (one with a cargo of rebel prisoners
    on deck), as well as forts, hospitals, and headquarters. A group of Black
    soldiers roll barrels in front of the U.S. Government Bakery. In another, a
    family of 4 freedmen is seen outside a large cabin. Unusual subjects include
    an attractive brightly colored view of the United States Capitol, and John
    Wilkes Booth (taken from a popular portrait). Two stylized views of soldier
    gravestones, one Confederate and one Union, bring gravity to the
    proceedings. <br><br>Richard, also known as Rychard or Richards, emigrated
    from Switzerland to the United States in 1854. The 1860 census found him in
    the town of Webster, NY near Rochester, where he worked as a day laborer. A
    few months after his enlistment in the 59th New York Infantry, he was
    seriously wounded at Antietam in September 1862 and was sent to a Union
    hospital in Chestnut Hill, PA. There he first became known for his art,
    sketching numerous scenes of Germantown. He was transferred in February 1864
    to the Veteran Reserve Corps, 135th Company, 2nd Battalion. <br><br>After
    the war, Richard settled in Philadelphia; some of his 1863 Germantown
    sketches were engraved for sale in the 1880s, and then posthumously
    published as "Quaint Old Germantown" in 1913. At some point shortly after
    the war, he painted a large oil on canvas view of the Battle of
    Fredericksburg, which ended up in the Nelson & Happy Rockefeller collection.

    Howell Cobb (1815-1868) of Georgia was President Buchanan's Secretary of the
    Treasury, but became an avid secessionist while still holding federal
    office. Writing just weeks after the election of Abraham Lincoln had pushed
    secession talk to the fore, he describes a conversation with his fellow
    secessionist cabinet member John Floyd, former governor of Virginia and at
    that point the Secretary of War: "I receved your letter and . . .
    immediately called to see Gov. Floyd. He authorizes me to say to you that
    Col. Hardee shall have the additional leave of absence asked for."
    Lieutenant Colonel William J. Hardee of the 1st United States Cavalry
    Regiment would soon resign his commission to join the Confederacy.
    <br><br>Cobb continues, "It gives me great pleasure to do any thing in my
    power to advance the policy of our noble state in preparing to maintain out
    of the Union that equality & independence which there is no hope longer any
    hope of preserving in the Union. God speed her cause & strengthen her
    resolution." <br><br>Just two weeks later, on 8 December, Cobb resigned his
    position in the United States cabinet. In February, he was chosen president
    of the provisional congress of seceded states in Montgomery, AL, and was
    thus the de facto leader of the Confederacy until the election of Jefferson
    Davis as president. Cobb then became a general in the Confederate Army, and
    remained in the field until after Appomattox.

    John Stevenson McNulty (1832-1915), an Irish-American saddler and postmaster
    from Monterey in Highland County, VA, in a remote mountainous region along
    the new border with West Virginia. He had a higher allegiance than to the
    Confederacy: he hoped to marry Mollie McClung. During the period of these
    letters, he avoided enlisting in the army, preferring civilian work in the
    quartermaster department so he could make frequent visits home. <br><br>Most
    of these letters were written from the major Confederate supply base at
    Staunton, VA, about 45 miles to the east of his home town, where he was paid
    $10 per day to make harnesses for the Confederate artillery in General
    Edward Johnson's brigade. He describes life in the Confederacy's border
    region. Molly's father was arrested but freed after he swore an oath to the
    Confederacy; a friend reported that in Highland there were "no Yankees
    anywhere in the county." He frequently reports on military actions in the
    Shenandoah region, particularly regarding Stonewall Jackson: Jackson's
    victory at the 25 May 1862 Battle of Winchester, and the Union cavalry's
    pursuit of Jackson in early June. As Jackson deployed to the Northern
    Virginia campaign, McNulty wrote that "the cars have been detained moveing
    Old Stonewall's forces from Richmond to Gordonsville" (19 July). On the day
    of the Battle of Cedar Mountain, McNulty wrote: "Old Stonewall has had
    another fight near Gordonsville" (9 August). He passes on news of the
    Confederate victory at Fredericksburg on 18 December 1862, boasting that the
    Yankees "have been sorely whipped" but bemoaning "the suffering of our
    homeless citizens in and around Fredericksburg." <br><br>McNulty reports on
    visits to Staunton's military hospital in his 3 June letter: "Oh! It is an
    awful pace. There is about one thousand sick & wounded & a great many
    dieing. In the dead room, more than once the rats have eaten out the eyes of
    the poor dead soldiers." On 19 July he reports on a nervous visit to
    Highland, where he ran into "that celebrated alarmist Jim Whitelaw, comeing
    at a gallop, with a dispatch for the cavalry at McDowell, & he told us that
    the Yankees were coming & for God sale to go back or we would be taken."
    McNulty ignored the advice, and the Yankees never came. On the same date, he
    hopes to be wed after the war: "It is uncertain when peace will be made.
    Perhaps not during the administration of Old Lincoln." On 9 August he
    reports that two Union companies from West Virginia ("Union traitors from
    the N.W. part of this state") have raided Highland County, burned one
    building, and took some local men captive: "They came very near getting the
    deputy sheriff of this county (John Armstrong) who was at Mrs. B's in bed.
    He ran out the back door & the Yanks called to him to halt & then fired on
    him, but he kept on running until he got to the bushes & made his escape
    without being hurt. . . . Most of the people out here are very much
    discouraged. Some think that the South will be overrun. They have begun to
    despair, and are already whipped." <br><br>Later in the war. McNulty became
    a lieutenant in the Confederate ordnance department, and married Mollie in
    1865. He had a long career as a public servant in Highland County.
    <br><br>WITH--a letter to Mollie from her brother John H. McClung in Rome,

    population adverse to them. . . . Their plan is to steal all the Negroes,
    horses, cattle and imprison the whites and in many instances burn the
    houses. . . . If the Yankees ever get into your county again, they will make
    a clean sweep of Negroes and stock." <br><br>AND--a manuscript transcript of

    General Lee issued this order early in his Maryland campaign, four days
    after he moved his Army of Northern Virginia into Maryland. The Confederates
    hoped that Maryland residents would greet them as liberators, so Lee issued
    this proclamation to assure civilians of his noble intentions: <br><br>"To
    the People of Maryland: It is right that you should know the purpose that
    has brought the Army under my command within the limits of your State. . . .
    The People of the Confederate States have long watched with the deepest
    sympathy the wrongs and outrages that have been inflicted upon the citizens
    of a Commonwealth, allied to the States of the South by the strongest
    social, political and commercial ties. They have seen with profound
    indignation their sister State deprived of every right, and reduced to the
    condition of a conquered Province. . . . Believing that the People of
    Maryland possessed a spirit too lofty to submit to such a government, the
    people of the South have long wished to aid you in throwing off this foreign
    yoke. . . . In obedience to this wish, our Army has come among you, and is
    prepared to assist you with the power of its arms in regaining the rights of
    which you have been despoiled. . . . Marylanders shall once more enjoy their
    ancient freedom of thought and speech. We know no enemies among you, and
    will protect all of every opinion. It is for you to decide your destiny,
    freely and without constraint. This army will respect your choice whatever
    it may be, and while the Southern people will rejoice to welcome you to your
    natural position among them, they will only welcome you when you come of
    your own free will." <br><br>President Jefferson Davis had drafted his own
    version of a proclamation to greet the liberated Marylanders, which placed
    more emphasis on the Confederacy's diplomatic position, but it did not reach
    Lee in time. Regardless, Lee's army was generally greeted with coldness or
    hostility, and after Antietam they soon retreated back across the Potomac.
    <br><br>An early pencil note on verso explains that this proclamation was
    "presented to D.J. Winter by Genl. Lee at the old Fair Grounds on the
    Williamsport-Pike, Saturday before the Antiedam Battle." Daniel J. Winter
    (1842-1913) was the son of a prominent farmer in Smithsburg, MD. Lee's army
    never reached as far as Smithsburg during that campaign, but did pass
    through Williamsport, MD to the west. According to the note, Winter would
    have received the proclamation on Saturday, 13 September, as the Battle of
    Antietam took place on Wednesday, 17 September. <br><br>Crandall 670;

    Edward William Drummond (1838-1876) was born and raised in Winslow, Maine.
    In 1859 he moved to Savannah, GA, where he worked as a bookkeeper and soon
    married a local girl. Secession soon presented him with a difficult
    decision. He sided with his wife's family and his adopted city, and joined
    the Chatham Artillery company as a sergeant in the Confederate service in
    August 1861. The company was stationed at the imposing Fort Pulaski, which
    guarded Savannah. The fort was an early target for a Federal offensive.
    <br><br>By the time this diary begins, Union artillery had nearly encircled
    Fort Pulaski, preparing to starve it into submission. Supply vessels were
    still managing to sneak through under heavy artillery fire. Drummond noted
    on 31 January: "I have been at work all day making a store room. We now have
    about one year's full rations for the garrison." Their telegraph cable was
    cut on 12 February, and the last supply steamer made it through the
    bombardment two days later. On 17 February he wrote "Here we are, cut off
    and likely to stay so." Four days later he noted "Tomorrow our Congress
    meets to sign the declaration of our independence, and the foundation of a
    permanent government." From this point onward, contact with the outside
    world was limited to an occasional boat sneaking through with mail, and of
    course constant observation of Savannah and nearby troops. 15 March was an
    exciting day: "We have had quite an advent today for us. Two White men and
    three Negroes came over through a creek from Wilmington Island, bringing
    with them four beeves, which are quite acceptable." The next day, "our beef
    friends probably got back safe as they displayed the given signal from
    Wilmington Island." On 18 March he noted proudly "Our old Merrimack or
    Virginia as she is now called has been doing great damage among the Federal
    Navy, which we trust is but a beginning." <br><br>On 10 April, the Union
    troops requested the fort's surrender, which was refused. In the ensuing
    bombardment, "we had two men injured. One lost an arm, the other a leg,
    together with other bodily injuries." The next day Drummond offered regular
    updates. "8 o'clock, fire getting hotter. Our wall a perfect honey comb. . .
    . 1½ o'clock, three casemates breached and shot pouring through and pepering
    our magazine, which cannot stand it long. . . . 2 o'clock, we surrendered.
    The 7 Connecticut and a Rhode Island regiment came over to occupy under Col.
    Terry." The fort's defenders were made prisoners of war, and on 22 April
    Drummond arrived at his new home, the prisoner camp at Governors Island in
    New York Harbor. <br><br>Drummond, who as a clerk sergeant was placed with
    the officers, gave Governor's Island good reviews. The prisoners were
    allowed to move freely about the island, and were permitted some
    communication with civilians in the city: "We could not have chosen a better
    place for imprisonment if we had made our own selection" (24 April). The
    prisoners had brought their enslaved servants with them. On 4 May, and order
    came for "all our Negro boys to be sent to New York and turned loose in the
    city. We all feel that it is hard and unmerciful. . . . They know no one,
    and will fare hard, poor fellows. . . . Unaccustomed to such treatment they
    had almost rather starve." On 28 May Drummond describes the prison
    newspaper, "Dixie Discourses," and two days later "we had our usual game of
    ball this morning. They are becoming quite exciting. All are improving in
    the science of the game and the sides are standing on equal terms." Hopes of
    an exchange were dashed on 19 June as Drummond and the officers were
    transferred to the prison at Johnson's Island in Lake Erie, off the coast of
    Ohio. On 21 June he made a crude sketch of the barrack arrangements.
    Baseball was resumed by 18 July. On 8 August a prisoner from Arkansas was
    shot by a guard for no apparent reason. On 10 August the guards pasted up
    broadsides offering freedom to prisoners who took the oath of allegiance,
    which was accepted by only one or two men: "The Yankees seem surprised that
    their flaming announcement is not more fully appreciated." Drummond was
    exchanged on 31 August and set off for the South. The young man from Maine
    wrote on 9 September: "Ho for Dixie. We shall soon be among our people." The
    diary comes to a close on 13 September as his steamer passed through
    Arkansas. The historical record shows that Drummond rejoined the 1st Georgia
    Infantry, served as a defender of Fort Wagner in South Carolina, was wounded
    at the Battle of Dalton, but survived the war and returned to Savannah.
    <br><br>This exceptional diary was published in its entirety in "A

    Mary Ann Dixon (1838-1921) was born and raised in Savannah, GA, and in 1860
    married Edward W. Drummond who had recently relocated to Savannah from Maine
    (see the preceding lot). He served in a Georgia regiment during the Civil
    War, including a stint in Union prison, and then died in a yellow fever
    epidemic in 1876, along with three of their four children. <br><br>Offered
    here is Mary's memoir of the Civil War from a Confederate wife's
    perspective. It was written at the request of her local Daughters of the
    Confederacy chapter. It begins with the call to arms, and her husband's
    service at besieged Fort Pulaski: "After the Harbor was blocked, a letter
    was of rare occurence, & oh the sad hours that were spent not knowing how
    soon the enemy might make an attack upon the fort." In Savannah, the
    residents would become excited when "occasionally a vesel would run the
    blockade & it would be hailed with delight. . . . We would make over odd
    dresses, turn them, add pieces to the skirts, and by trimming, make a new
    one." She describes the arrival of Union occupation troops in Savannah at
    length: "We were up very late the night before, burning letters and all
    papers of importance as we did not know what to expect. . . . My little
    3-year-old son went to the window and exclaimed 'Oh Mamma, look at the
    soldiers.'" She offered a Union sentinel some coffee and breakfast, and he
    pledged to protect her home. This preserved her family's livestock, and a
    buggy which she was later able to sell for $175. She recounts the order for
    all families of officers to be sent across the lines; she was permitted to
    stay until her son recovered from an illness. On her departure, she was
    ordered not to bring with her any of her husband's clothing: "I said, 'That
    is very hard, my husband bought & paid for his clothing.' He laughed & said
    'You are unfortunate in having a husband in the Rebel Army.'" She then went
    as a refugee to Augusta, GA, where she stayed as a guest of a family friend
    until her return to Savannah. At the end of the war, she returned to
    Savannah by a cotton steamer, sleeping in a tent on the deck: "We had to

  CROSSHEAD: Letter by one of General Wild's infamous female hostages.
  TYPESET: >-
    Autograph Letter Signed as "Nannie White" to Brigadier General Edward A.
    Wild. One page, 8 x 5 inches, plus integral blank; minimal wear.
  at-a-glance: 'Norfolk, VA, 14 January [1864]'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Among Confederate circles, General Edward A. Wild (1825-1891) was one of the
    most notorious Union generals. In April 1863 he became one of the first and
    most enthusiastic leaders of the United States Colored Troops as commander
    of "Wild's African Brigade," with headquarters in Norfolk, VA. On several
    occasions, his brigade took Confederate women as hostages. One of them was
    Miss Nancy "Nannie" White of Knott's Island, NC, aged 23, who was captured
    on 21 December 1863 and sent back to the brigade headquarters in nearby
    Norfolk, VA. This may have been done in retaliation for her family's aid to
    escaped Confederate prisoners. She was held in the home of one of Wild's
    officers until released on 14 January 1864, when she wrote this letter
    exonerating General Wild from blame. <br><br>"I respectfully relate that
    during the time that I have been a prisoner under you and confined in Capt.
    Croft's quarters, I have been treated very kindly, indeed more than I could
    expect, and have had everything done that could conduce to my comfort, and
    shall ever feel grateful to you for your lenientcy, and to Capt. Croft and
    family for the many kindnesses that I have received during my imprisonment."
    <br><br>Of course, a letter written by a hostage probably should not be
    taken literally, particularly if their release depends upon it. See the 2003
    book by Frances H. Casstevens, "Edward A. Wild and the African Brigade in
    the Civil War," pages 127-141; this letter is published on page 140, and was
    cited as belonging to a private collection (footnote 68 on page 292).

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    First edition, marked up with his revisions for a later edition. Abner
    Doubleday (1819-1893) was a Union Major General who should be best
    remembered for commanding the I Corps on the first day of the Battle of
    Gettysburg, blunting the onslaught of a much larger Confederate force until
    the Union Army could regroup. He is actually remembered more for something
    completely fictional (his alleged invention of baseball), but he was an
    important general. <br><br>The revisions found in this book, clearly in his
    hand, did not appear in the 1885 reissue of the book, but most of them did
    appear in the 1892 and 1912 editions. The revisions appear on pages 49, 54,
    57, 61, 101, 103, 129, 184, 195, 196, 210, 213, 215, 217, 218, 219, 220,
    221, 229, and 232. For example, Doubleday added a footnote to page 49,
    softening his assessment of General Joseph W. Revere's performance at
    Chancellorsville. On page 61, a footnote was added praising the heroism of
    the 2nd Rhode Island Infantry at the same battle. On page 196, Doubleday
    added a footnote with an anecdote about the heroism of an artillery
    lieutenant named Woodruff. Two minor revisions (on pages 50 and 213), the
    only ones in black ink, did not make the 1892 edition. A manuscript footnote
    at the base of page 103, regarding the narrow escape of Rhode Island cavalry
    colonel George N. Bliss at Gettysburg, also did not make the later edition.
    In addition to the revisions, a clipped 1886 newspaper article by Doubleday
    is laid down to the rear flyleaf, and a pencil battle plan on graph paper
    titled "Position of I Division II Corps, May 2d 1863," 3¼ x 5¼ inches, is
    laid down to the rear free endpaper. This plan is not reproduced in the 1892

    This album was apparently compiled by Abraham Jonas (1804-1864), who was the
    first Jewish resident of Quincy, IL, served in the Illinois legislature, and
    became a good friend and supporter of Abraham Lincoln. Jonas arranged the
    Lincoln-Douglas debate in Quincy in 1858, and publicly supported his
    dark-horse nomination for the presidency. Six of Jonas's sons served in the
    Civil War--four with the Confederacy and two with the Union. His son Edward
    L. Jonas (1844-1918) was a lieutenant in the 50th Illinois Infantry. This
    scrapbook contains many highlights. <br><br>3 original telegrams. In two of
    them, Illinois Secretary of State Ozias M. Hatch informs Abraham Jonas of
    war and political developments, including a 17 February 1862 telegram
    reporting on the Union victory at Fort Donelson. A third telegram dated 21

    a license for the sale of intoxicating liquor to soldiers. The other is
    General Orders No. 158 issued from the Headquarters of the 16th Army Corps
    in Memphis, TN, appointing Jonas as acting aide-de-camp to Major General
    Hurlbut. <br><br>The clippings begin in 1860, with discussion of secession
    and the presidential election examined from both sides. Most of the
    clippings are uncited, but one is from the New Orleans Daily Delta. The
    western theater of war is a special focus, as might be expected. One article
    on the Battle of Wilson's Creek is annotated: "Battle near Springfield, Mo."
    Some of the clippings relate directly to the children of Abraham Jonas. A
    clipping of an anonymous 1860 satirical campaign song is noted in pencil "S
    A Jonas." Abraham's son Sidney Alroy Jonas (1838-1915) went on to serve as a
    major in the Confederate army for a Mississippi regiment. A published letter
    from Edward Jonas to his parents dated 1 April 1862 reports on his
    regiment's movements in an unknown newspaper. The last date noted among the

    An unusually large and varied Civil War archive, including personal letters,

    Charles Palmer Judkins (1842-1900) came from a Quaker family in Cincinnati,
    OH, and enlisted in the 60th Indiana Infantry in February 1862. In August
    1862 he became a quartermaster sergeant, in November a sergeant major, and
    then in January 1864 a lieutenant and regimental quartermaster. After the
    war, he was a physician in Cincinnati. <br><br>The earliest letters are
    written from Camp Morton in Indianapolis, where the regiment guarded
    Confederate prisoners. On 8 March 1862 he describes some of the Confederates
    who were detailed to work in the regimental offices, one "a lawyer in
    Frankford Kentuckey and owns half a plantation and Negroes in Georgia, the
    other is the Flying Dutchman, a celebrated boxer; besides them we have a
    cook, one who used to be a servant to one rebel officer. He is a very good
    and quiet man, and I don't think he will poison us. . . . The poor prisoners
    are dying off very fast, 13 one day, 14 next and so on. It is a great deal
    harder on the Mississipians than any other." The regiment spent the last
    half of 1862 in Kentucky. <br><br>The regiment's heaviest action was in the
    Vicksburg Campaign. Judkins did not seem to understand General Sherman's
    concept of "total war": "We are now on the road to Vicksburg, Miss. . . . We
    stopped last night at Gaster's Landing. . . . The men destroyed everything
    by fire except one house. There was a fine dwelling house here unoccupied,
    which has several small Negro houses around it. One of these took fire and
    was put out by Mr. Carter our chaplain and myself. . . . I do think that
    Gen. Sherman is very much to blame for not putting a stop to such acts of
    incendiary, for it can do no good, and only aggravate the enemy more" (21
    and 24 December 1862). He had his first taste of heavy combat at the Battle
    of Chickasaw Bayou. "I have just returned from an expedition against
    Vickburgh. . . . five o'clock in the morning when all at once the heavy guns
    on our left about two miles off opened fire, and if thee ever saw a person
    get up quick, I did. I thought all the thunder clouds in the heavens had
    opened on us. . . . The expedition was a failour. . . . We passed an anxious
    night, all of the regiments gone off the field and ours left to cover the
    retreat, keep up the camp fires, and make the enemy believe that all the
    troops were there still" (27 December 1862). <br><br>Next came the Battle of
    Arkansas Post: "The fort we had to take was almost impreginable, in fact if
    it had not a been for the gunboats they never could have captured it" (14
    January 1863). A small diagram of the fort and battlefield is enclosed,
    showing the location of the gunboats and rifle pits. <br><br>Judkins spent
    months at the Siege of Vicksburg, described in his diary on 25 and 26
    February 1863: "There was heavy firing all of last night. . . . It was
    caused by a raft that was sent down by some of our generals, fitted up like
    a gunboat, with a big log for a gun. She passed the batteries safely with
    only one hole through her. . . . The men complain a good deal of the way
    they were treated by the general, forcing them to march 20 miles a day
    through mud 20 inches deep, and threatening to shoot them if they lagged
    behind." An undated letter fragment from early in the siege features a
    nicely done pencil map of the area, with his note: "The enemy occupy all of
    the country on the Vicksburgh side of the river, and we the other. How we
    are to get at eachother seem still to be a hidden matter, for it is certain
    death for either to attempt to cross the Mississippi." <br><br>Judkins added
    more in a 5 June 1863 letter: "The enemy sleeps during the hottest part of
    the day, and comes out of their holes in the mornings and evenings when our
    men amuse themselves by firing at them. . . . We heard today from Youngs
    Point the same force of Rebels that attacked us at Perkins Plantation came
    up and attacked the troops there. There were some Negro troops at the point,
    some of which were taken prisoners, whom the Rebels put to death. The other
    Negroes found it out, and went in again and cleaned the Rebels out. . . . I
    have just been up our rifle pits looking at gunboats shelling the city. It
    is quite a novel sight. You can hear our pickets talking to the rebels,
    asking them if they have plenty of food and so forth." A small drawing of
    the rifle pits, batteries, and surrounding hills is enclosed.
    <br><br>Judkins came from a Quaker background. Although that did not stop
    him from enlisting in the army, he did sometimes call the months by their
    numbers rather than their pagan names, and favored "thee" over "you"--at
    least in these family letters. His mother considered visiting his camp at
    one point, and he responded: "Don't think I would be ashamed of thy plain
    bonnett anywhere, and most especially here where I am known to be a Friend"
    (8 March 1862). His family seemed to have mixed emotions about his
    enlistment. On 3 March 1863 he wrote in his diary "I am glad to find my
    mother holds the opinion she does in regard to deserting. It relieves my
    mind of a good deal of anxiety, for I don't know what I might have done if
    she had so counseled me." <br><br>Among the ephemera in the collection, most
    interesting is an undated printed sheet titled "Rules for Camp Morton." The
    camp allowed the prisoners to choose their own officers, who were
    responsible for "policing for health and comfort, the construction of new
    sinks when necessary, and the daily throwing in of lime and mould to prevent
    bad odors." None are traced in OCLC or at auction. <br><br>Among the very
    few post-war items in the collection is a large 1902 oil portrait of Judkins
    painted by prominent Cincinnati artist Charles T. Webber (1825-1911), best
    known for his 1893 World's Fair painting which dramatized the Underground
    Railroad. <br><br>A massive archive which should be of interest to anyone
    studying the Siege of Vicksburg, Indiana in the Civil War, or Quakers in the
    military.

    Charles Springer Myers (1834-1920) of Gosport, IN is shown with his son
    Charles William Myers (1860-1911), who likely served as his eyes. He had
    been a married blacksmith with three children before enlisting in the 21st
    Indiana Infantry, and was severely wounded at Port Hudson in 1863, filing
    for an invalid pension within months. In the 1880 census for Gosport,
    Indiana he is listed as a blind broom-maker, and is also listed in the 1910
    census as blind. His 1920 death certificate lists him as a blacksmith; he
    died in Gosport.

    The Confederate cavalry general John Hunt Morgan launched his first raid
    across Kentucky on 4 July 1862, raising alarm across the state. This
    broadside was issued by the Union military governor of Kentucky in
    Covington, just across the river from Cincinnati. It orders that all
    able-bodied citizens of the county report for militia duty by 10 p.m.: "Such
    as have arms and ammunition will bring them. . . . Those who are willing to
    fight against the traitors who are threatening your city will be organized
    into Companies and Battalions. . . . All refusing to bear arms in such
    defense will be disarmed. . . . All persons not armed are forbidden to
    appear in the streets of the City, until otherwise ordered, under the
    penalty of being shot down." On this occasion, Morgan returned south well
    before reaching Covington; his 1863 raid skirted north of Covington across
    Ohio. <br><br>The text of this proclamation was published in the New York
    Times of 21 July 1862, but we trace no other examples of this broadside in

    The 10th Maine Infantry was mustered in October 1861, and then spent most of
    November on guard duty at the Relay House in Relay, MD, an important Union
    transportation hub. This song was written to memorialize the regiment's
    Company F, known before the war as the Lewiston Light Infantry. The regiment
    had no martial accomplishments by this date, but every single soldier in the
    company is given a line or two in verse. Most of them make puns on the
    soldier's name or reference their height, age, or occupation as recorded on
    the company's muster roll. "Charles Burr is a boy of eighteen years / And
    Amaziah Grant / The oldest man now in our mess / Doth still for glory pant."
    This is probably not the only poem to name every man in a company--but we
    can't recall ever seeing another. <br><br>Life soon became less peaceful for
    the 10th Maine, which suffered heavy losses at Antietam, Chancellorsville,
    and Gettysburg. We can find no other mention of this poem--in OCLC, at
    auction, or even in Gould's 1871 regimental history.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Baltimore was rocked by rioting on 19 April 1861, when federal regiments
    were mobbed by protesters. 4 soldiers and 12 civilians died that day. In
    response, this broadside takes the side of the rioters, declaring the
    secession of Maryland to be a settled issue and urging the city's rebels to
    report for enlistment. In part:<br><br>"The hour for action has arrived--Let
    not the precious time be wasted for useless talk. . . . The bloody scenes of
    Friday, and the commotion of the last two days and nights, shew how
    necessary it is to be prepared. Our people are now a unit, all manner of
    differences are merged in the deep affection felt for good Old Maryland. The
    covenant has been sealed in blood. . . . We are in the midst of Revolution.
    . . . The glorious flag of the Union is a memory of the past. The only flags
    which now float over our city are the flags of the South and the banner
    borne by the Maryland Line." It notes that George Washington once swore his
    loyalty to the British flag, but then devoted his life to freedom from it.
    <br><br>Regarding the federal troops surging into Baltimore, "it is
    pretended that these troops are the troops of the United States, and have
    been legally called forth. This the people of Maryland and the constituted
    authorities of Baltimore deny--with one voice the armed action of the people
    and the military is approved. . . . Let it not be supposed that the
    Revolution, because it burst forth in a day, will die out in an hour. Not
    so, the bloody deeds of Friday last are written in lurid characters upon the
    Southern sky." Thousands of secessionist militiamen are said to be streaming
    into Baltimore to resist the federal troops: "These noble men should not be
    subjected to inconvenience for the want of shelter and provisions for
    themselves and their horses. Persons properly appointed should receive them
    and provide for all their wants." <br><br>In conclusion, "it is suggested
    that all Citizens who are willing to be of Service . . . meet at 8 o'clock
    to-morrow morning, to enrol their names and report for duty. . . . Jone's
    Falls will meet at the junction of Broadway and Baltimore Streets; those
    West of the Falls in Monument Square--Books for Enrolment will be Opened in
    each place. Remember, there are no Sabbaths in revolutionary times--'the
    better day, the better deed.'" <br><br>A pencil note, apparently written at
    the time by the author, explains the distribution: "Published on the 21st of
    April 1861 (Sunday), and given to the citizens of Balto. on that morning at
    the corner of Balto. and South Sts." None traced in OCLC or at auction, nor

    was even a good thing. He had been accused by his opponent in a recent
    circular of being disloyal, and here rebuts those charges at length,

    citizens had aided Jubal Early's recent Confederate cavalry raid into
    Maryland, even "pointing out to the Rebels . . . the property of Union
    citizens." Bier orders that all of these disloyal citizens be arrested and
    sent to military prison in West Virginia, sending ""their families beyond
    our lines South." He adds that "You will seize their Houses to be used for
    Hospitals, Government Offices, and Store Houses" and "their furniture you
    will have sold at Public Auction." <br><br>The second order is from Union
    General David Hunter, newly returned from his own marauding Lynchburg
    Campaign in western Virginia. Hunter orders that every male citizen of
    Frederick be given a week to swear an oath of allegiance to the Union: "All

    Joseph Torksey Fearing (1842-1895) served in an unusual company of Maryland
    cavalry which was not attached to any regiment. They spent almost all of
    their three years of service on Maryland and Virginia's Eastern Shore.
    Fearing was promoted from sergeant to lieutenant in September 1863, and
    spent much of the next several months as acting commander of the company
    while Captain G.W.P. Smith was away on other duties. Captain Smith, upon his
    return, tried Fearing under this court martial, with a sweeping array of 11
    charges, some with several specifications, ranging from refusing to
    acknowledge Captain Smith; holding a vulgar conversation with a woman in
    Newton, MD; falsely accusing Captain Smith of appropriating captured goods;
    cutting down a widow's oak tree to extract honey from a hive; stealing
    geese; and much much much more. <br><br>None of the charges stuck. As
    detailed in Toomey and Earp's "Marylanders in Blue" (pages 158-159), Captain
    Smith was then himself court-martialed for "preferring frivolous charges
    against Lieutenant J.T. Fearing . . . by reason of personal animosity."
    Smith and Fearing remained with this turbulent company until mustered out on
    30 June 1865. No other examples of this court martial broadside have been

    As a young physician, Charles Edward Goldsborough (1834-1913) settled near
    Gettysburg, PA. During the Civil War he served as a surgeon in the 5th
    Maryland Infantry. He worked out of a hospital in Frederick, MD, and the
    September 1862 capture of the city by the Confederates is told with high
    drama. Goldsborough spent a stint confined at Libby Prison (not well
    described here), and was exchanged in time to attend the consecration of
    Gettysburg in November 1863, which is discussed for three pages in his
    memoir: "This seems strange and almost remarkable, but the great throng was
    there more to see Mr. Lincoln than to hear what he had to say." He recalls
    that "the day was an ideal Indian Summer day, with just enough crisp in the
    air to make fall clothing comfortable." <br><br>The reminiscences begin with
    23 complete pages of typescript covering the period 1856 to September 1862,
    followed by 23 pages of quite irregularly paginated manuscript which appear
    to be incomplete, and concluding with 26 pages of somewhat continuously
    numbered manuscript pages starting in November 1863 and concluding in 1865
    with "The End." Also included is a typescript transcript of a program for
    the "Libby Prison Minstrels" from 24 December 1863. <br><br>Also included in
    the lot are Goldsborough's pre-war reminiscences, as published in an
    unidentified newspaper circa the 1890s under the running title "Adventures
    of a Runaway Boy." This covers his travel adventures from 1851 to 1854,
    including the Lopez expedition to liberate Cuba, a trip down the
    Mississippi, a trip across the Great Plains by wagon, a meeting with Kit
    Carson, encounters with the Mormons in Salt Lake City, mining in California,
    a clipper ship to Peru, and other interludes. These clippings are mounted on

    Jotham Tilden Moulton III (1836-1909) was a Maine native who relocated with
    his parents to Chicago in adolescence. His father was a lawyer, edited the
    Chicago Tribune, and was said to be a personal friend of Abraham Lincoln.
    Young Moulton, judging by these letters, was at the outset of the Civil War
    a lukewarm Unionist at best. <br><br>Moulton was a civilian when he wrote
    the first two letters offered here. In 1861 he sought a position as a school
    teacher, and removed to Farmington, Missouri, south of St. Louis, which like
    much of the state was in a state of simmering violence between secessionists
    and Unionists. As a northerner who tried to remain outside of politics, he
    came under suspicion from both sides. On 5 August 1861 he wrote: "The people
    here were almost unanimous for the Union a few months ago, but now they are
    almost unanimous for the Southern Confederacy. . . . One evening, a party of
    men, wishing to get a free dram, stopped and represented themselves as
    Federal soldiers. The Englishman treated them, and lent his horse to one who
    was on foot. They thanked him warmly, gave three rousing cheers for Jeff
    Davis, and rode off." Tilden added "I certainly shall not violate my oath,
    though my sympathies are all Southern." <br><br>Later that month on 31
    August, he wrote again from the "Independent Republic of Missouri": "Horse
    stealing is so common as hardly to be thought a crime. The practise of
    wearing arms is almost universal. I slept one night in a house where three
    or four secessionists locked the doors and lay down with pistols under their
    pillows and guns leaning against their beds." He became increasingly leery
    of the extremism of the secessionists: "An Englishman undertook to get up a
    home guard in this vicinity. The citizens pulled down his flag and tore it
    to pieces. A few days afterwards he was taken out of his house and shot."
    One of the killers was a former student of Moulton's: "He speaks with
    perfect coolness of putting prisoners to death in cold blood."
    <br><br>Moulton soon felt compelled to choose a side, and enlisted in
    September 1861 with the 33rd Illinois Infantry, which had so many educators
    it was informally known as the Teachers' Regiment. He was not much of an
    asset to the Union cause, however. The three soldier letters in this lot,
    dated January through November 1862, were all written from various
    hospitals. On 26 October he wrote: "A year's service has abated my ardor, as
    well as shattered my constitution."

    A promotional brochure for "Canes Manufactured from the Live Oak Timber of
    this Celebrated Iron Clad Ram." This was a partnership of merchant and
    timber agents W.P. Tilley & Co. and the diver Captain William West, both of
    Norfolk. They secured a trademark for their canes on 11 April 1876 and swore
    to the authenticity of the canes on 17 April, obtaining three local
    character references on the same day. The interior pages offer the history
    of the legendary naval vessel, which began as the USS Merrimack, was
    salvaged and transformed into an ironclad as the CSS Virginia, and then was
    destroyed in the James River to avoid capture in May 1862. As described
    here, "Captain West, the diver, took hold of remains of the wreck, and
    during the present year has managed to bring up several of this vessel's
    original oak timbers, which has been manufactured into walking canes."
    Tilley's canes are, unfortunately, not described or illustrated. This was
    not the first or only effort to salvage timber from the wreck; another
    Merrimac cane had been presented to Jefferson Davis in 1867. See Robert A.

    The 69th New York Infantry, also known as the "Fighting Irish," was one of
    the war's most celebrated regiments. They guarded the Union retreat at the
    First Battle of Bull Run, suffering heavy losses. This scrapbook was kept by
    Lieutenant William M. Giles (born circa 1829), a New York druggist, who
    commanded Company B at Bull Run during his initial 90-day enlistment; he was
    later in 1863 appointed as a medical storekeeper for the Army. This
    scrapbook, while not artistically compiled, is rich in primary source
    material for the 69th during the first months of the war, including these
    highlights: <br><br>A trimmed songsheet, "Battle of Bull-Run, Dedicated to
    the 69th Regiment, N.Y.S.M." <br><br>A cargo list of what appear to be 48
    enslaved people being shipped from Baltimore to New Orleans, with ages and
    heights given for each, but the ship and date not named. This and two other
    documents are captioned: "These papers were picked up in a pocket book on
    the battlefield of Manassas or Bull Run on July 21st 1861, William M.
    Giles." <br><br>5 manuscript orders issued by the regiment's famed Colonel
    Michael Corcoran in July 1861, as written out by adjutant John McKeon. They
    include a 3 July order on the celebration of Independence Day ("Capt. T.F.
    Meagher will read the Declaration of American Independence"); copy of a 7
    July letter to General Sherman regarding their enlistment term; a copy of
    Sherman's 11 July order requiring "troops to be in light marching order" and
    prepared to leave their knapsacks (ten days before Bull Run); a 13 July
    parade order; and the 13 July formation of a court martial.
    <br><br>Manuscript "charges profered against Serg't Patrick Boyle for
    drunkness and abusive language" against Col. Corcoran. Dated Fort Corcoran,
    29 June 1861. <br><br>2 copies of a printed general order issued by Giles as
    commander of Company B, regarding a parade at the regimental armory, 14
    October 1861.<br><br>Another printed order featuring the elaborate
    regimental seal ("Gentle when stroked, fierce when provoked"), dated New
    York, 9 October 1861. <br><br>Muster-out oath taken by Giles upon the
    expiration of his 90 days of service, 16 August 1861. <br><br>Oath taken by
    Giles as militia surgeon, August 1855. <br><br>Running account of spirits
    consumed by Lt. Giles, including whiskey, beer, ales, claret, champagne and
    a "dinner for 4 friends," perhaps prepared by a local innkeeper, 7-26 June
    1861. <br><br>4 manuscript receipts issued for work on Fort Corcoran in
    Washington, August 1861. <br><br>List signed by 46 men with their addresses,
    headed "We the undersigned agree to become members of Co. B 69th Regt.
    N.Y.S.M. and to equip ourselves according to law." Undated. <br><br>Letter
    to "my dearest husband"; the final page with signature is pasted down, but
    is presumably from Mrs. Giles. Expresses joy at his imminent muster out,
    although she had heard "how anxious Corcoran was to have the reg't remain."
    New York, 14 July 1861. <br><br>A pair of passes issued to Giles as medical
    storekeeper, August 1863. <br><br>A piece of North Carolina scrip issued for
    5 cents on 1 October 1861, captioned "Given by Daniel Shorter, Co. B, 69th

    This meeting was called to fire up New York City's flagging patriotism, at
    approximately the halfway point between the wild enthusiasm of April 1861
    and the anti-war Draft Riots of July 1863. This broadside urges "all the
    zeal, all the power, and all the loyal feeling of its citizens, native and
    adopted," including the recruitment of new soldiers "to fill up the veteran
    regiments of New-York volunteers" and form new regiments, notably the
    predominantly Irish-American Corcoran's Brigade being formed by Col. Michael
    Corcoran of the legendary 69th New York. The notice concludes with a call to
    "give your means, your strong arms, and your resolute hearts to put down
    rebellion, and to uphold the flag of the Union." The meeting is discussed in
    George Winston Smith's article "The National War Committee of the Citizens

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Nicholas Ecker or Eacker (1819-1905) was a farmer from St. Johnsville in
    Montgomery County, NY who descended from the hard-pressed Palatine German
    settlers of the Mohawk Valley. He enlisted as an older soldier in the 153rd
    New York Infantry in August 1862. He was apparently only semi-literate; his
    13 August 1863 letter notes: "The name of the person who writes my letters,
    his name is Martin V.B. Ashley, a sergeant in our company." Several letters
    were written while stationed as a guard at Forest Hall Prison in Georgetown,
    DC. On 10 September 1863 he wrote: "Night before last there was about 240
    prisoners brought here, so we have about 400 of them here now." On 6 October
    1863 he visited the Patent Office and saw military relics of George
    Washington and Andrew Jackson. On 21 December 1863 he planned to visit
    Congress in session: "I like to hear these great men talk what they are a
    going to do. I was their last week and I enjoyed it very much." His 13
    January [1864?] letter discusses "rebel prisenors": "Thier is a great many
    of them here yet. They keep a comeing in every day and when the prison gets
    full they send them to Point Lookout, and keep them thier untill they get
    exchanged or die." <br><br>Two letters were written in early 1864 when the
    regiment was in Louisiana on the Red River Campaign. On 26 June, while
    camped in Morganzia on the banks of the Mississippi, "one of the boys . . .
    was drowned last night while in swimming. They tried to get him out but the
    current was so swift that they could not, and they have not found him yet."
    They returned north in July 1864, and Ecker was wounded at the Third Battle
    of Winchester, 19 September 1864. An undated note from a comrade testified
    (probably for a disability claim): "Nicholas Ecker was wounded in the neck
    by what was supposed to be a piece of the lock of a gun at the Battle of
    Winchester." On 11 October he assures his daughter it is only "a small flesh
    wound . . . it was a terrible battle and our boys fought nobly, driving the
    Rebels from every position they occupied." After the end of hostilities, the
    regiment remained for the occupation of Georgia. Ecker was in Savannah for
    Independence Day and reported that "the niggars had a parade through the
    streets." <br><br>After the war, Ecker was a farmer at Hannibal, further
    north in New York.

    John W. Barrett (1823-1900?) of Fulton County, NY enlisted in the 184th New
    York Infantry late in the war. He spent the first three months of this diary
    at the Siege of Petersburg. His diary entries are substantially longer and
    more observant than the average. On 14 January he heard that "about 300
    Johnnys are out in the country gobbling up all the darkeys and everything
    else. In the morning there is a raid going out. . . . I have been detailed
    for the raid." The next day he went out under Major Ferguson and ventured 11
    miles into Rebel territory: "A woman came out on the stoop and said that she
    had never seen a troop of northern soldiers before. . . . A Negro went out
    as a guide. We brought in his family. One of the officers got off his horse
    and had it harnessed onto a cart and brought in a number of Negro women and
    children." On 24 January, "heavy firing all of last night and today in the
    direction of Dutch Gap. The Rebel rams endeavored to come down the river but
    were attacked by the land batteries. Two of the rams were sunk, the other
    one ran aground. A troop of cavalry came around this place to intercept the
    crew if they endeavored to escape from the ram." On 26 March, General
    Sheridan passed through his camp, and was observed to be "rather below
    medium height, rather fleshy. He stopped with the Col. about half an hour."
    On 2 April, the day of the Union breakthrough, "heavy firing all night. The
    horizon was constantly lit up by the constant discharge of musketry and
    artilery. . . . The cannonading has been so heavy as to jar the ground and
    windows." The next evening, "there has been three explosions, one in the
    direction of Petersburgh, the other two in the direction of Richmond. They
    were so heavy that the vibration of the earth was like an earthquake. . . .
    All of the afternoon there has been extensive columns of smoke rising in the
    direction of Richmond." <br><br>Barrett had a deep interest in the Black
    soldiers and locals he encountered. On 4 January, "I went into an aged
    Negro's house . Saw some books laying on the stand. Took one up & asked him
    if he could read. He stated that he could but not much. One of the books was
    the P.E. Prayer Book printed in the year 1717. The other was Watts' Psalms
    and Hymns." On 16 January, "there was a wedding in the Negro camp. The bride
    is a first rate good looking wench. They were married in the open field on
    the banks of the river. Hope their jorney through life will be a prosperous
    one." On 4 February, in response to a Rebel raid, "the Major in command of
    some 25 or 30 darkies cav. went after, they followed them 12 miles, came up
    with them, had a hand to hand fight with some of them, they say killed the
    Reb scout by striking him." On 18 March, "a Negro came in direct from
    Richmond. He stated that he was sold in R a few days ago for 3500 dollars in
    CA money, but the same night he was sold, he made his escape." <br><br>In
    the closing days of the war, Lee's surrender and Lincoln's assassination
    were of course noted with interest. While waiting for his discharge, Barrett
    made a visit to occupied Richmond on 1 June, described in an epic 9-page
    entry. On 12 June, "four or five colored regiments left for Norfolk. The 54
    Mass, one of the oldest collored regs, was included in the number." Barrett
    mustered out on 29 June and arrived home on the 4th of July. The rest of the
    diary covers his quiet life in rural New York.

    interesting Civil War content. Her cousin L.B. Sprague of the 138th New York
    Infantry wrote in December 1862 while a patient at Douglas Hospital in
    Washington, the Union's most elegant hospital, located in the fashionable
    Minnesota Row townhouse once owned by Stephen Douglas. A cousin named Annie
    wrote from Medina, NY in April 1865 to describe the local memorial
    arrangements for President Lincoln in church, with "a photograph of Lincoln
    draped with crepe and a large crepe bow . . . It looked so mournful I could
    hardly help weeping." <br><br>In 1866, a sister-in-law named Bess wrote from
    her new home in frontier Gillford, MN: "Here I am in our own little cabin.

    rear of the volume are 15 pages of diary entries. Perhaps the most
    interesting was written on 20 September 1863 regarding the Battle of
    Chickamauga, although it is almost completely illegible. It reads in part:
    "Engaged the enemy, making several charges. Privates Haines, Borer, LaRue,
    Pilate wounded. Martin [???] were surrounded and charged our way through.
    [???] 13 miles to within 5 miles." <br><br>The volume is not signed, but as
    it was kept in a "Sergeant's Roll Book" and is partly filled with a
    sergeant's rolls kept for Company A of the 11th Ohio, the author was likely
    one of their sergeants. Sergeant John Beam Steward (1837-1916) of Dayton, OH
    was the only one to appear consistently throughout the span of this volume
    (Sergeant Elsbury Covault was also on the rolls,. but as the spelling of his
    name changes frequently he was not likely the author).

    Charles Augustus Dean (1844-1921) was an 8th Vermont Infantry Civil War
    veteran from Shrewsbury, MA who moved in 1864 to Cincinnati, where he worked
    as a factory hand and traveling salesman for the paper bag manufacturers
    Nixon, Chatfield & Woods. These letters were written to a hometown friend,
    and offer a good taste of Cincinnati life and politics during and after the
    last months of the Civil War. On 25 September 1864 he wrote "There was a
    great McClellan meeting here last Monday eve and last night a Lincoln
    meeting, great fireworks and processions at both. I went to the one last
    night." On 6 November 1864 after the Battle of Cedar Creek, he reports on
    their late regiment's hardships: "Our reg't, the 8th Vermont, was badly cut
    up in the late fights, 165 lost, Reed lost his leg. . . . I hope that Old
    Abe will call for 500,000 more men as soon as he is re-elected and end the
    war immediately." On 11 November he reported on the election: "Old Abe is
    all right now, and some say 4 yrs more of war." On 11 December he describes
    a bet whether Grant takes Richmond before New Years. On 26 February 1865 he
    wrote "One of the principal newspaper offices was burned out this morning,
    the Cin. Enquirer, a Copperhead sheet, and a great many were verry glad of
    it. It was but just across the street from my room here on Walnut and it
    made me arise verry early, I tell you, for Sunday." <br><br>The post-war
    letters sometimes discuss the local political climate. On 25 May 1868 he
    wrote that in "this rebel town . . . I am mum on my political standing and
    say very little to my customers here about negro suffrage and the
    impeachment." His 1 May 1870 letter notes "you ought to see the style of
    colored Fifteenth Amendment which just passed. How much we like them now
    they can vote. I propose to give them something so as to be elected to
    furnish paper to their public printing. Republicans & Democrats are soft
    shoeing them for votes." <br><br>As a commercial traveler, Dean often
    described other cities near Cincinnati. On 18 April 1869 he describes a
    visit to Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, and encloses "a small sample of gypsum
    which I procured from a point nine miles from the mouth of the cave." On 11
    August 1869, he describes a visit to Niagara Falls at length. Dean later
    returned to Massachusetts and became a successful bag manufacturer on his
    own account. <br><br>WITH--a folder regarding Walker's work with the New

    John Jacob Hering (1842-1864) was the son of an affluent farmer in
    Beavercreek, Greene County, near Dayton in southwestern Ohio. In May 1864,
    he was commissioned a lieutenant in the 154th Ohio Infantry, a 100-day
    regiment which spent much of its term in and around New Creek, WV, guarding
    an important supply depot from Confederate raiders. <br><br>Hering did not
    see much action until the final days of his service, in a 4 August action
    sometimes called the Battle of New Creek Station, although it is not on most
    official lists of battles. On 2 August he noted "rumors about the Rebs
    coming into camp," and the next day the cavalry "report the enemy within 9
    miles, 2,000 strong." He also noted that "15 negroes came into camp,
    mounted." On the day of the battle, he reported "loss of reg't, 9 miss'g, 4
    wounded. . . . Fight commenced at 2, continued until 9 o'clock p.m. Co. A
    relieved Co. A of 11th [West] Va. in evening, remained on line all night.
    Baldwin wounded." On 5 August his company led the pursuit: "154th with 2
    pieces of artillery followed the Rebs 3 miles, Co. A in the advance
    skirmishing." With their fighting done, on the 6th "boys went out on the
    battle ground in search of trophies." The regiment mustered out soon after.

    Thomas Pomp Kinsey (1822-1887) was at the age of 40 called up for emergency
    service in the 11th Regiment of Pennsylvania Militia in response to the
    Confederate Maryland Campaign of September 1862. In his first week, he was
    sent nearly to the front lines for the bloodiest day in American history. On
    the day of the battle of Antietam, he wrote: "A battle has been going on
    within 6 miles of us. The cannonading was very distinct. The Rebels
    attempted to cross the Potomac 9 miles below Hagerstown. . . . If we don't
    have a hand in the fight, we shall at least get to see some prisoners." Four
    days later, he wrote with an update: "We were drawn up in line of battle in
    the morning after being supplied with 45 rounds of ball cartridges. . . .
    McClellan was shelling Jackson's force at this time, and the flash of the
    gun could be plainly seen from where we were. About half of F. Bickley's Co.
    left their position, but I am proud to say that there was but 4 of our Co.
    skedaddled." Thomas was apparently a practicing Quaker, a pacifist faith.
    His wife wrote on 21 September: "William and the rest of the Friends think
    you have done rong by going, but as long as you think you have done wright
    it don't matter what thay think." <br><br>Also included is a letter from
    brother George Washington Kinsey (1834-1917) of the 26th New Jersey
    Infantry, in camp at Hagerstown, MD, 29 October 1862; and an 1872 letter
    from Thomas's son Irvin Kinsey to his brother Harry describing gun practices
    in Texas: "I have had no time to hunt alligators or deer. The only use I
    have known people to put them to in Austin is to shoot one another, and that
    is something I don't care about doing." <br><br>Also included in this lot is
    a peculiar memorandum book kept circa 1839-1840 by Thomas P. Kinsey as a
    young man, consisting partly of instructions for magic tricks and circus
    acts: "To make a room seem all on fire"; "To make an air balloon"; "Thunder
    powder"; "To render hedious the faces of all present." Some of these are
    copied from Harry Dean's magic classic, "The Whole Art of Legerdemain."
    These are followed by less exotic recipes and instructions, such as "To
    enamel picture glasses with gold" and "Method of cutting glass without
    cracking." A few pages are devoted to his "account of where my money went
    the 2d year at Butz & Miller's Foundry," and many pages are illustrated with
    mechanical drawings, cartoons, and doodles, including a circus scene titled
    "Elephant Menagree."

    This volume was used to record official correspondence, incoming and
    outgoing, relating to the Union prison at Fort Mifflin, located south of
    Philadelphia on the outskirts of the present airport. The prison housed
    captured Confederates, Union deserters and other offenders, and civilians.
    Much of the correspondence relates to individual prisoners. A 7 January 1864
    note describes two German-American draft dodgers. The next day expressed
    confusion regarding the arrival of a W.H. Power who was sent without irons
    and no paperwork. On 2 February 1864, the character of a Union soldier named
    Silas Mansfield is defended; he had been detailed as a provost guard back in
    1862 but had been unfairly named as a deserter in his company rolls. On 11
    February 1864 is recorded a dispute over sending Union and Rebel prisoners
    together to clean out a moat. On 19 February 1864, a Confederate named
    William Bowman who had deserted at Chambersburg during the Gettysburg
    campaign is recommended for release "in consequence of his good conduct
    while here." <br><br>This volume was kept from January to May 1864 by
    Captain Cyrus S. Haldeman as Assistant Adjutant General under Major General
    George Cadwalader, military commander of Philadelphia. He often recorded
    messages from the Fort Mifflin post commander, Captain J.O. Fennie. After
    going unused for several months, the volume was taken over from November
    1864 to July 1865 by Lieutenant Frank H. Wentz, who served as the post's
    adjutant, assistant quartermaster, and commissary of subsistence. These 1865
    entries are less substantial. In the rear of the volume are 4 pages of
    personal ledger accounts kept by Wentz, 1870-1871.

    "I am a member of the Secret Service, first served under Gen. Rosecrans in

    15th Oct. 1861, one hundred miles within the enemie's lines while on a
    secret expedition for Gen. Rosecrans. Escaped from Richmond 22nd Feb. 1862 .
    . . Overtook the army at Mt. Jackson [VA] on the evening of the 4th of June.
    Capt. Hopper ordered me to make myself generally useful as scout until the
    chase was on for [Stonewall] Jackson and then report to him for special
    service. From that time I was advance scout until the battle of Cross Keys,
    was the first to discover the position of the enemy that morning, and
    reported the same to Gen. Milroy. . . . I was captured by a band of
    guerillas. I was sent to Lynchburg, where I met S.J. Callahan of the Jesse
    Scouts. From that time we were together until we escaped from Richmond by
    changing our names and getting off as regular soldiers." The Jesse Scouts
    were Union soldiers who assumed the identity and documents of captured
    Confederates and went under deep cover. <br><br>Louis P. Stone (1843-1903),
    a Cincinnati druggist, went on to own a hotel in Deadwood, SD. His career in
    the Secret Service is discussed in Fishel, "The Secret War for the Union,"
    pages 179-180. This letter was written as part of his extended effort to be
    paid for his services: "It is poor encouragement for me to risk my life as I
    have done, and get nothing for it." Letters describing life in the Secret
    Service are rarely seen because, well . . . it was secret.

    When the Civil War began, Alexander Jackson Hamilton (1815-1875) of Austin
    was representing Texas in Congress. He was a vocal Unionist, and fled Texas
    in July 1862. Lincoln appointed him "Military Governor of Texas" with the
    rank of Brigadier General; he spent the war in New Orleans. Meanwhile, his
    wife and children were still in Texas. <br><br>This letter was addressed by
    his wife Mary Jane Bowen Hamilton (1828-1916) to the Confederate governor of
    Texas, Pendleton Murrah: "My husband Gen'l A.J. Hamilton . . . expresses a
    very strong desire for his family to join him, and wishes us to go by the
    way of Matagorda Bay." She requests "the necessary papers to insure our safe
    transit to that point" and "a sufficient escort to protect us from insults
    or interference on the route." She planned to bring her 3 daughters and a
    15-year-old son. <br><br>On verso, Governor Murrah refers the request to
    General John B. Magruder as commander of the District of Texas, requesting
    that it be granted if deemed "consistent with the interest of the service
    and the country." <br><br>Hamilton was later named governor of Texas in the
    first months of Reconstruction. "Whatever measure of success the governor
    enjoyed was due in part to the capable assistance of his wife. Her gentle
    spirit and quick wit soothed tensions at the mansion on more than one
    occasion"--McQueary, "Dining at the Governor's Mansion," page 45.

    Captain J.H. Rambo of the 22nd Texas Infantry writes to a colonel that
    Private H.A. Nichols was wounded in the Battle of Pleasant Hill in April
    1864, and requesting that he "be detailed in the harness shop at Tyer
    Texas." A note by three surgeons from the Medical Examination board attests
    that Private Nichols had a "gunshot wound in the right thigh partially
    severing the external hamstring" and recommending "post duty of some kind
    requiring but little locomotion." On verso are about a dozen docketing notes
    signed by a dizzying array of officers as the simple request worked its way
    up the chain of command. Major General John H. Forney signed in Crockett, TX
    on 28 March 1865, and the commander of the Department of Texas, John B.
    Magruder, over his department's 29 April inked stamp. Finally the request
    started to trickle back down to the head of the harness shop, who brought up
    a simple point on 12 May: "If he is not a harness maker, I do not want him;
    if he is, his services are needed." The Department of Texas surrendered
    three weeks later.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This partly printed "Confederate States of America Soldier's Discharge"
    certificate was issued to a soldier in Texas more than a month after
    Appomattox. Printed by E.L. Cushing & Co. of Houston with a decorative
    border and a woodcut of a cannon, its appearance suggests an orderly
    demobilization of the Confederate forces which was very far from the truth.
    One hint of the chaos is a single overprinted line which must have been
    added for the final dispersal of troops: "Having remained true to his colors
    to the last." It is printed a few degrees off line, and partly covers
    another line of text. <br><br>The discharged soldier, Private Joseph Woods
    Bradford (1821-1894), had been a Galveston justice of the peace before
    serving three years with the 4th Texas Cavalry, part of the colorful Arizona
    Brigade. His regiment was largely disbanded by the time this discharge was
    issued. A portion of them had taken to freestyle marauding in northern
    Texas, and some of the remaining Confederate units were actually tasked with
    hunting them down. The discharge is signed "By order of Maj Gen Magruder" in
    an unknown hand. John B. Magruder, Confederate commander of the District of
    Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, would formally surrender what remained of
    his army on 2 June. <br><br>We have traced no other examples of this
    certificate at auction, although the dealer Eberstadt offered one in his
    1963 catalog. We find a variant printing on WikiTree with a portrait of Jeff
    Davis instead of the cannon.

    second one with a few pages smudged but generally clean and legible,
    memoranda volumes quite worn.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The first diary begins with service in Missouri, leaving for Kentucky on 31
    May 1863 and soon arriving in Tennessee for the Chickamauga and Chattanooga
    campaigns. The second diary begins in Tennessee in January 1864. The
    regiment was engaged in frequent skirmishing, driving in enemy pickets, and
    foraging. At the Battle of Dandridge on 17 January, "the enemy advanced
    again the afternoon. After a severe contest we succeeded in holding our
    ground, but with considerable loss." In the 27 January Battle of Fair
    Garden, "companies E F & I charged two regts of Rebs and drove them several
    miles. Myself & ten men captured two ambulances and two prisoners & two
    mules." Shortly after the arrival of a fresh batch of enlistees at
    Cleaveland, TN, on 2 April, "14 of Co. H men were taken prisoners. 12 of
    them were recruits and were out on their first day's duty." <br><br>For the
    spring of 1864, the regiment joined in Sherman's Atlanta Campaign. At the
    Battle of Rocky Face Ridge in Georgia, 7 May, "8th Iowa charged on a Reb
    battery at Varnell & were repulsed. This reg't then charged into the town
    and took possession, and camped there for the night." The next week at
    Resaca, 14 May, "Co. F thrown out as pickets. Canonading and musketry was
    heard nearly all day . . . succeeded in turning the enemy's right flank." A
    daring raid is described on 26 May: "Five companys of this regt charged
    about 2 miles into the Reb lines, captured 48 prisoners. Fell back with
    small loss. Sergt. Inman wounded, lost several horses." He describes his
    role in McCook's raid behind the lines southeast of Atlanta from 27 to 30
    July: "Marched nearly all night, not allowed to build fires. . . . Several
    shots were fired at us which we did not return. . . . Skirmished with the
    enemy for several miles, charged on them several times. At last charged into
    the heads of two brigades. Lost Maj. Payne, Lieut Warren and several
    others." After most of the raiders had returned safely, on 6 August "several
    men came in this morning dismounted who had travelled through the woods
    several days." On 3 September he happily reported "news of our troops taking
    possession of Atlanta." <br><br>The memoranda volumes include various
    scrawled pay and clothing lists for the author's company, as well as a "sick
    report." One includes three pages of quite accomplished pencil drawings,
    including portraits of Private Herkimer Fuller and Major Thomas Mars, two
    unidentified portraits, some architectural details, and most lovingly, "the
    stove of Squad 5, Company F, 1st Regt.," with soldiers' boots warming
    nearby. <br><br>This diary's author and his regiment are not named, but his
    movements match the regimental history of the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry
    perfectly, and Colonel Oscar LaGrange is mentioned frequently. Most of the
    dozens of named enlisted men are from the regiment's Company F. Holden
    Roswell Smith (1836-1906) of that company was a New York native who settled
    in Wisconsin shortly before the war. On 23 March 1864 he notes sending money
    to his father Sheldon Newton Smith, who is also mentioned on 31 March 1863;
    on 17 July 1864 he notes his promotion from corporal to quartermaster
    sergeant. A few pages of postwar memoranda include "threshing acct of Smith
    & Porter" including S.N. Smith. Sergeant Smith was very likely the author of
    all four volumes.

    Charles John Lind (1842-1905) was a German immigrant from Bad Ax County (now
    Vernon County), WI. He wrote this lively memoir of his Civil War experiences
    in 1898, starting with his enlistment in the 6th Wisconsin Infantry in early
    May 1861. The regiment was part of the legendary Iron Brigade of the West
    which earned its nickname at the Second Battle of Bull Run, and suffered the
    highest casualty rate of any Union brigade in the war. That battle is
    recounted in detail here, as well as South Mountain and Antietam, where Lind
    was badly wounded in his left eye. His long recovery is described, as well
    as his return to the service for the closing months of the war with the 47th
    Wisconsin Infantry. He wrote this narrative for inclusion in a Wisconsin war
    memorial in Madison, asking that it be returned to his home in Hillsboro, WI
    after it was transcribed. <br><br>Appended to Lind's narrative is a two-page
    note by H.W. Rood, the Custodian of Memorial Hall, explaining in 1903 that
    it had been transcribed: "I think it a most excellent story and am glad to
    put it where it may be kept . . . long after every old soldier of the Civil
    War is called into the Camp beyond the River." He suggests that survivors of
    "the old veteran should keep this book as a precious treasure--never part
    with it. . . . They should now and then read the story till they are filled
    with the spirit of it, and know it by heart." This engaging narrative of
    service in an important unit has apparently not been published.

    carried away the two Highland Men's Heads, and cut and mangled their Bodies
    in a most barbarous Manner." The British sent reinforcements to Amelia from
    Cumberland Island (just over the line into today's Georgia). On the 17th,
    General Oglethorpe led four rowboats south from Frederica, GA to confront
    the Spanish, chasing them about for 16 miles across Amelia Island, but the
    Spanish managed to escape. The final rumor was of a large body of Spanish
    troops massed at the St. John's River in Florida. <br><br>We find no

    Mullet Key, a small chain of islands south of St. Petersburg, was used as a

    station to isolate travelers on their arrival to Florida. Construction on
    Fort de Soto on Mullet Key began in 1898 to help protect Tampa Bay during
    the Spanish-American War. The site was abandoned in 1937 and rededicated as
    Fort De Soto Park in 1963. This image of the station's officer quarters was
    shot by Tampa photographer Albion Morgner Windhorst (1881-1952). It shows a
    lone cannon pointing seaward as two soldiers patrol the porch. Early images

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This daybook records the retail liquor sales from a distillery operated by
    Oliver Cromwell Rood (circa 1778-1845?) in the Colbyville neighborhood of
    Waterbury, VT. He sometimes made dozens of sales in a day, mostly of gin
    (selling for between $1.00 and $1.25 per gallon), and to a lesser extent
    whiskey and "high wines." Rood also ran a grist mill and was involved in
    other ventures, but those must have been recorded in other volumes--this
    daybook records little other than liquor sales until about 1815, comprising
    more than 200 pages of densely written entries, each one naming the
    purchaser and the quantity. The entries after 1815 are much sparser and
    reflect other kinds of business, but are in the same hand and the customers
    still appear to hail from Waterbury. <br><br>Rood's heavy involvement in the
    liquor trade is alluded to rather disapprovingly in the 1882 Vermont
    Historical Gazetteer: "Mr. Rood had a rather varied fortune in life, and one
    habit, almost universally prevalent in his day, he lived to overcome, much
    to the comfort of his later years. . . . O. C. Rood put up here a potato
    whisky distillery, and ran it as long as self interest or a true sense of
    moral propriety, in his judgment rendered it advisable" (pages 833, 912).

    First edition. This pamphlet was Hamilton's awkward attempt to clear his
    name during America's first major political sex scandal. Hamilton was
    married and serving as Secretary of the Treasury in 1791 when he began a
    year-long affair with a young married woman named Maria Reynolds. Her
    husband James soon found out, but rather than challenge Hamilton to a duel,
    he demanded regular blackmail payments instead. In November 1792, James
    Reynolds was caught in a different scam (embezzling the pension payments of
    Revolutionary veterans), and attempted to blackmail Hamilton into protecting
    him. Hamilton came clean privately to John Adams and James Monroe, and they
    decided to ignore the sordid affair. However, Hamilton's enemy Thomas
    Jefferson started to leak the story of the affair in 1797. At this point
    Hamilton realized that the only way to protect his professional reputation
    would be to lay it out for public consumption. This pamphlet includes his

    corruption--but also a cheating scoundrel. <br><br>As one might imagine,
    Mrs. Hamilton was not a big fan of this "Reynolds Pamphlet"; the family soon
    bought up as many copies as they could find and destroyed them. It did not

    Charles Dana (1824-1906) graduated from the University of Vermont and was a
    merchant in New York, St. Louis, San Francisco, and served as an officer of
    several companies including the North American Steamship Company. He was in
    Hawaii from 1854 to 1856, where as an agent of Page, Bacon & Co., he helped
    to establish the kingdom's first bank. His son Charles Anderson Dana became
    a noted philanthropist. This collection includes several noteworthy
    documents relating to Hawaii: <br><br>A 8-page manuscript draft of Page,
    Bacon & Co.'s original petition to the "Houses of Nobles and Representatives
    of the Hawaiian Islands" to establish the first bank: "To promote the
    interests and prosperity of said Kingdom and especially to advance its
    commercial interests (the great source of wealth to any people), a bank of
    issue, discount and deposit is greatly needed at Honolulu." The preamble is
    followed by 11 sections, some of them marked "expunged." Charles Dana is
    mentioned as a bank representative in Section 6. The draft is unsigned and
    undated, but likely dates to mid-1854; the bank was running ads in the
    Honolulu Polynesian by 14 October 1854. <br><br>A 2 July 1857 Honolulu
    letter from Dana's business partner Asher B. Bates reports on the Hawaiian
    scandal of the decade, when a young merchant named Marcus Monsarrat was
    caught in bed with Victoria Kamamalu, sister of Kamehameha IV. The letter
    reports: "Monserrat & Victoria were found together in her room by the King
    and Lot, & Lot presented a pistol to his breast & gave him the ultimatum:
    death or perpetual banishment. Monserrat said he deserved to die, but he
    preferred his life in another land & took a sudden departure. . . .
    Monserrat it seems has meddled with other people's potato vines before, but
    has always been able to hush it up. He is now charged publickly with having
    prostituted two wives of other white men in town--they were native women."
    He adds a complaint about "whore house dances at our hotels." <br><br>Two
    letters from Senator Solomon Foot of Vermont discuss efforts to appoint Dana
    as American Commissioner at Hawaii under the new Lincoln administration. On
    3 December 1860, Foot asks whether Dana would want the job, as he had
    "passed several years there and maintained the most intimate relations with
    the members of that government and understand something of their language."
    On 31 March 1861, Foot expresses disgust that Dana was not awarded the
    position: "I have been chagrined, mortified, mad at our loss of the Hawaiian
    mission, & mostly for the reason that a poor drunken vagabond has the plum.
    . . . I saw Seward yesterday on the subject of assisting you to another
    plum, but he said no further consular appointments would be made for some
    time to come." <br><br>3 pages of incomplete notes from a lecture on Hawaii,
    apparently in Dana's hand. He describes his attendance at a traditional
    Hawaiian luau given by Prince Lot Kamehameha (later King Kamehameha V), with
    meats and vegetables wrapped in leaves and cooked in a pit with coals, "some
    native dances performed in the old fashion by very pretty girls" and music
    "produced by beating tom toms." In attendance was Captain Theodorus Bailey
    of the USS St. Mary's, placing the luau circa late 1854. His historical
    musings include a long denunciation of Captain Cook's impact on the island:
    "The people were not taught Christianity, but licentiousness & lust. . . .
    Women were enticed and decoyed on board his ships by scores & hundreds &
    there was planted the seed of that foul disease which has like a leprosy
    tainted the blood of these people and consigned their disfigured and
    disgusting corpses to untimely graves by thousands." He also gives a share
    of criticism to the Catholics: "With force and arms, ships of war, the
    braying of trumpets and roar of cannon was this repugnant religion forced
    upon an unwilling people." The notes are undated, but Dana made similar
    comments at a Missionary Society meeting in New York, as reported in the
    Pacific Commercial Advertiser of 14 July 1859. <br><br>In addition to the
    Hawaiian material, this lot contains: <br><br>23 business letters to and
    from Dana, 1854-1872, most relating to his role as Vice President of the
    North American Steamship Company. Notable are 9 letters from the company's
    president William Henry Webb (a notable shipping magnate and later the
    founder of the Webb Institute of Naval Architecture), 1867-1869. The letters
    discuss the planning of steamer routes, and some of the ships which Webb
    designed such as the USS Dunderberg. <br><br>21 family and personal letters,
    1849-1860 and undated. Most notably, a 10 September 1860 letter from his
    brother in San Francisco states "The election of Lincoln is a foregone
    conclusion, tho it is best not to be too certain until the election is
    over." On 21 November 1860, his father A.G. Dana wrote a long denunciation
    of the secessionists, and added "I am more & more convinced of the wisdom of
    selecting Lincoln instead of Seward for our leader, and I am proud &
    gratified to believe that 7 votes were given for him by myself, my sons &
    son-in-law!"<br><br>A folder of 18 ephemera and documents, including a small
    broadside for a lecture by Dana on "Naples and its Surroundings" in
    Stockton, CA, 8 May [1851 or 1856?]; 6 family cartes-de-visite; a calling
    card reading "Secretary of State," Dana's circular letter to the bondholders
    of Des Moines Valley Railroad in 1874; and 7 checks and bonds from
    California banks, 1851-1864.

    The Iran-Contra Affair was perhaps the biggest political scandal of the
    1980s. The Reagan administration wanted to offer support to the Contras, a
    Nicaraguan rebel group, but were forbidden from sending funds by an act of
    Congress. Members of the administration instead set up an elaborate secret
    operation, selling weapons to Iran (itself the subject of an arms embargo)
    and using the funds to pay international soldiers of fortune to train the
    Contra rebels. This being the 1980s, cocaine smuggling also played a
    prominent role. The scheme started to unravel in 1986 as reports leaked to
    the press. <br><br>One of the many Iran-Contra exposés was a 31 May 1987 Los
    Angeles Times Magazine article by Michael Fessier, "An American Contra,"
    which described the five mercenaries hired to run a Contra training base in
    Costa Rica. One of them was "a big, angry, black-bearded Frenchman, an
    ex-paratrooper named Claude (Frenchy) Chauffard who hated communists and
    wore a 'Kill Em All and Let God Sort It Out Later' T-shirt." After leading a
    cross-border raid on a Nicaraguan military base, the five mercenaries were
    arrested in April 1985 and charged with violating Costa Rican neutrality.
    Their shadowy American sponsors disappeared, and the angry, confused
    mercenaries went to trial. As Fessier described it, "Chauffard, whose size,
    temper and unintelligibility had prompted local journalists to nickname him
    'The Monster Idiot,' lunged at [fellow defendant] Glibbery when the sentence
    was read. 'You communist pig!' he screamed, lifting a small Costa Rican to
    whom he was cuffed, swinging him like a puppy on a rope." He was sentenced
    to five years in prison in October 1986. <br><br>Offered here is a long and
    characteristically angry letter written by Chauffard to an American contact
    while awaiting trial. It names many of the key players in the scandal. He
    starts with his fellow mercenary and defendant, "the dirty dog Peter
    Glibbery. . . . This young fucker had just begun to get involved with some
    unamericans, you know the identity, but let's remain you their respective
    fucking names: [Senator John] Kerry from Mass., who, for sure, is acting in
    the name of [Ted] Kennedy for '88 elections. . . . The whole game has been
    set up in view to trap a guy so named Oliver North who is working as the
    right hand of Admiral Pointdexter. The Democrats might, I say, might have
    more or less some suspicion about the role played by G.B. [Vice President
    George Bush?] and Marlboro cow-boy [Reagan?] into a possible campaign . . .
    operated down in C.A. [Central America] on the both borders of Nicaragua. .
    . . We were used as scapegoats to cover up something, and even perhaps one
    another stuff even bigger which perhaps was canceled at the latest minute;
    something concerning the U.S. Embassy and its ambassador in Costa Rica. . .
    . Send me down here a nice letter . . . explaining Mr. Asshole [Glibbery?]
    that he was put back in prison to protect him first against himself, second
    against the commies and the Democrats. . . . He is just a young motherboy
    who got trapped in something too tough for him, so he lost his mind." He
    adds that "two journalists from the States have been trying to see me, but
    until now I managed to avoid em. They are respectively Steve Kurkjian and
    Bob Healy [of the Boston Globe]. They left the accompanying message on my
    cot." He signed simply "Huge kisses, Nasty Reb-Frog." Also included are:
    <br><br>The referenced note addressed to Claude Chauffard by journalist Bob
    Healey, asking to give him a call. <br><br>"Destruction of the Contras'
    Costa Rican Front." An unsigned, undated, and unpublished 11-page photocopy

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    George Yamaoka (1903-1981) was born in Seattle, WA to Japanese parents.
    After graduating from the University of Washington and Georgetown Law
    School, in 1931 he became the first Japanese-American admitted to practice
    law in New York. In 1946, when war crimes trials began against Japanese war
    leaders, Yamaoka was appointed as counsel general for the defense, helping
    the defendants navigate the American military justice system and receive
    fair trials. He then built a prosperous New York law practice, often serving
    American businesses in the Japanese market. <br><br>This archive of
    Yamaoka's personal papers includes: <br><br>Carbon copy of the press release
    announcing the executions of 7 Japanese war criminals including Hideki Tojo,
    23 December 1948. <br><br>Two copies of Yamaoka's birth certificate, one of
    them stamped for his 1946 passport application. <br><br>Packet of 63
    photographs from the International Military Tribunal in Japan, many by the
    U.S. Army Signal Corps, including most notably a group photograph of the
    International Military Tribunal defense attorneys, signed by 15 of them
    including Yamaoka; and a group photograph of the 11 judges of the
    International Military Tribunal while hearing evidence, signed by most of
    the judges, circa 1948. <br><br>Packet of 15 photographs of the London Naval
    Conference, which Yamaoka attended as an aide to the Japanese consul, 1930.
    <br><br>39 miscellaneous photographs, including three formal portraits of
    Yamaoka, snapshots of Bank of Tokyo events, and snapshots from his funeral.
    <br><br>A thick folder on Yamaoka's genealogy, more interesting than most
    genealogical notes. When he came to prominence in the 1946 trials, it was
    learned that his father had come from a very prominent Japanese family but
    secretly emigrated to the United States under an assumed name.
    <br><br>Scrapbook from Emperor Hirohito's visit to New York, 1975.

    First edition. This is the first complete translation of the full Hebrew
    Bible (Old Testament) by a Jewish translator into English, building upon
    Leeser's 1845 translation of the five books of the Torah. Previous editions
    published by Jews in England had simply utilized the King James translation.
    Leeser's preface explains that this massive undertaking sprung from "a
    desire entertained for more than a quarter of a century, since the day he
    quitted school in his native land to come to this country, to present to his
    fellow-Israelites an English version, made by one of themselves, of the Holy
    Word of God." Readers would now "have an opportunity to study a version of
    the Bible which has not been made by the authority of churches in which they
    have no confidence." <br><br>Provenance: the front board bears a
    gilt-stamped presentation, "David C. Labatt to Henry J. Labatt, June 1st
    1854, Hoc in signo semper fidelis." The Latin text translates to "With this
    sign, always faithful." David Cohen Labatt (1828-1893) was raised in New
    Orleans, son of Abraham Cohen Labatt, a seminal figure in the history of
    Reform Judaism in America. David was an attorney, and later served as a
    captain in a Louisiana regiment in the Civil War. He presented his book to
    his 22-year-old younger brother Henry Jacob Labatt (1832-1899), who had
    attended the University of Louisiana, received a law degree from Yale, and
    then moved west to Gold Rush San Francisco with their father. Young Henry
    was already on his way to becoming one of the leading experts in Californian
    law, and would soon launch the first Jewish newspaper in the American West,
    Voice of Israel. In 1842, the same year he received this gift, he was named
    the secretary of Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco. Henry spent much of
    the Civil War in Nevada, and then settled in Texas in the late 1860s. During
    the horrific 1900 Galveston hurricane, Henry and most of his family were
    killed in the flooding. We presume this volume had already left the family
    by 1900, and may well have remained behind in California when Henry moved to
    Nevada circa 1862. On the Labatts, see two articles in the journal Western
    States Jewish History: William Kramer, "Henry J. Labatt, Pioneer Lawyer of
    California and Texas," XXVIII:3 (April 1996); and Norton Stern, "Henry J.
    Labatt, Influential Jewish Attorney," XLI:1 (Fall 2008)--copies of both
    publications are included. The volume was later part of a California
    research library, and was properly deaccessioned to the consignor.

    of the Wide-Awakes, the paramilitary Lincoln supporters, from New York City
    and beyond. Four parade marshals are named, and the home territories of each
    Wide-Awake group are described, including Hartford, New Haven, northern New
    England, Philadelphia, Jersey City, upstate New York, Brooklyn, Long Island,
    and Manhattan's various wards. A few Lincoln supporters from the southern
    border states even made the trip from Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and
    Missouri. Among the rules for the march: "No derisive caricature,
    transparency or device calculated to give offence, will be permitted in the
    pageant, and no person not in uniform will be allowed in the ranks. Ribald
    expressions or demonstrations are unworthy the notice of the Wide-Awakes."

    In the wake of the assassination plot, which had targeted the Vice President

    provides for a detail of 7 men in a "detail for guard duty at the residence
    of the Postmaster General . . . to be in charge of Mr. Meigs." The docketing
    explains that this was a "detail of clerks of P.O. Dept as guard for P.M.
    General Dennison's house . . . Such a guard or a military one was posted at
    each one of the Sec's house after the assassination."<br><br>The guard was

    The fate of the small bundle of papers found upon Lincoln's body has been a
    subject of some intrigue. Edward McPherson (1830-1895), the longtime clerk
    of the House of Representatives, tried to unravel it. According to the
    Library of Congress, Justice David Davis wrote to McPherson on 22 June 1866,
    "stating that the papers found on President Lincoln's person were sealed by
    Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War. Later the papers were opened in Justice
    Davis' presence." <br><br>In the present letter, written 3 weeks later,
    Stanton's loyal personal secretary wrote to McPherson: "The papers found
    upon the person of President Lincoln, and which you were hunting for
    recently, have turned up. Please call and see the Secretary about them today
    if possible." <br><br>WITH--a carte-de-visite photograph of McPherson by

    of Mr. Lincoln by Mr. Marshall has been received. I have never seen an
    engraving of anyone with whom I was acquainted that would compare with it.
    It was my happiness to have seen a great deal of Mr. Lincoln, and to me it
    is quite evident that the artist has caught the expression his face always

    Leonard Wells Volk (1828-1895) produced his famous life mask of Lincoln in

    produced a small pamphlet to advertise the work, which was reported widely

    Hartford Armstrong, and toured with him for years from Florida to
    Pennsylvania. After her father's death in 1939, she continued to tour on her
    own until about 1970. The "1889" in the title presumably refers to when her

    Rare printing of the Pennsylvania Dutch "Spiritual Labyrinth" broadside,

    Illustrated broadside, 18¼ x 12½ inches; short separations at folds, other
    minor wear.
  at-a-glance: 'Boonsboro, MD: Josiah Knodle, 11 November 1843'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The Boonsboro area of western Maryland was the destination of many
    Pennsylvania Dutch emigrants seeking new pastures in the early 19th century.
    This broadside is an English translation of the "Geistlicher Irrgarten," a
    Pennsylvania Dutch staple which traces the Christian spiritual journey in a
    graphic maze format: "By the windings of the reading is represented the
    various cares and perplexities of life." We trace no other examples of this
    Boonsboro printing of the Spiritual Labyrinth, with its elaborate decorative
    border. <br><br>A distinctive element of Pennsylvania Dutch culture is its
    folk magic tradition, also known as "pow-wow" or "braucherei." Among the
    handful of other works published by Josiah Knodle was an 1845 conjuring book
    by Michael Zittle, the "Wizard of Zittletown," titled "A Friend in Need; Or,
    Secret Science" (not offered here). Accompanying this broadside, and sharing
    its Boonsboro-area provenance, are 9 manuscript spells and recipes on slips
    of paper. Two of them are on the verso of waste paper dated 1848 and 1862,
    placing them in the same era as the Spiritual Labyrinth. Several describe
    spells for use in folk remedies. A "cure for a burn": "Take the middle
    finger and make it wet with spit, then go round the burn 3 times wile you
    say these words: 'Youst dar londs mon is got for dar colt an for dar hais
    bront', then blow over the burn 3 times, repeat 3 times." <br><br>Most of
    the slips are recipes for dyes and folk medicines. One other slip has a
    pow-wow aspect, though. It directs us to "repeat the four lines 3 times":
    "Der Rothlaufen und der drach / Flogen mit einander eaber den bach / Das
    rothlaufen vergant / Und der drach varshwand." This slip does not explain
    what will happen if you follow these directions. Swann Galleries will bear
    no responsibility for any occult forces unleashed by the utterance of these
    lines.

    Deborah Salter (1640-1719) and her husband Robert Searles (1636-1717)
    married in England and settled in Dorchester, MA by 1662. This seemingly
    unrecorded and unpublished pious tribute to her character and celebration of
    her life includes verses regarding her reasons for leaving the land of her
    birth. It begins, "Great Conqueror! What must thy Icy hand Subject each age
    and sex at thy command?" In the second stanza, "In Europe's garden born
    brought up with care; by godly parents whose ancesters there; a plentiful
    estate did long retain, until the most unhappy Charles's reign; who did his
    subjects ancient rights invade; and was a victim to their fury made; then
    wealth living lost, peace from the nature gone; and Charles the Second
    mounted on the throne; she being married loved not to stay; in Europe but
    came with her mate away; took ship upon renowned England's shore; crossed
    the Atlantick (never cross'd before.)"<br><br>Her death is variously
    recorded as 1712, 1713, 1714, or 1717, but this poem states that she died on
    2 March 1718/9 in her 80th year. It is signed twice in a different hand by
    Jabez Searle, possibly her son who died in 1724. It is also signed "G.
    Searle," another relative who apparently served as the scribe.

    The Dorchester South Meeting House, also known as the Second Congregational

    the church from 1810 to 1816, listing the minister and the principal texts.
    The Rev. John Codman was the principal minister, but guest ministers were
    common. A few of the volumes from the period of the War of 1812 seem to
    address contemporary concerns, such as on 23 July 1812 shortly after
    fighting began: "Fast Day, Mr. Codman, James 4-1. From whence come wars and
    fightings among you? Come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your

    This club was founded in northeast Massachusetts by 10 musicians, and soon
    expanded to 15. They agreed that "no spectators shall be admitted at any
    meeting of the Band for rehearsal" and that "all unnecessary noise, tuning
    of instruments &c shall be considered out of order." At rehearsals, band
    members often brought original compositions which would be named in their
    honor, such as "Thompson's Quickstep" and "Tenney's Quickstep." They ruled
    that "no change of instruments shall be made by any member without the
    consent of the band." At one meeting they voted that "George Harnden have
    liberty to exchange the Drum for the Trumpet, and that Mr. A.B. Noyes be
    requested to play the Bass Drum." Snare drum, cymbals and fife are also
    mentioned at various points. One member, David B. Tenney, was paid 50 cents
    per piece to write out arrangements for each instrument. The band's first
    public concert was scheduled on 24 January 1850 with 4 vocal and 9
    instrumental pieces, and that same day they agreed to play at a Temperance
    Levee in nearby North Andover. A gig at the Universalist Church brought in
    $20.31, and more bookings followed, as well as oyster suppers in their
    honor. Things seemed to be going well, but then the band voted to cancel two
    bookings, went silent for two weeks, and on 25 March 1850 voted "to sell the
    property of the band at auction this evening" and "the President of the Band
    act as auctioneer." The money was divided among the members and the band was
    summarily dissolved, just five months after it was launched.

    by a grand circumambulation. . . . The day will open of its own accord, like
    a stale clam." The elaborate order of march includes "the Springfield
    Aqueduct Company squeezing rotten lemons for the Home for the Friendless,"
    and "Doctor G.W. Crazy, ears buttoned over his head with vegetable ivory
    buttons, holding in his hand a small vial of sugar pills." The orator of the
    day was the noted itinerant eccentric "Daniel Pratt Jr., the Great American
    Traveler, on a shutter, drawn by eleven lame grasshoppers." The program
    closes with an allusion to the battles of President Andrew Johnson with
    radical congressional leader Thaddeus Stevens: "The above will take place
    strictly according to programme, unless vetoed by Andy. . . . If vetoed by
    Andy, special authority to proceed will be granted by Thad." None traced in

    30 Autograph Letters Signed from Captain E.L. Jerauld to brothers Edward F.

  at-a-glance: 'East Harwich, MA and elsewhere, 1878-1886'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Ensign Lewis Jerauld (1834-1917) was a fishing boat captain in East Harwich,
    MA, at the elbow of Cape Cod. His correspondents were brothers Edward
    Freeman Potter (1839-1914) and Charles William Potter (1848-circa 1899), who
    owned several fishing and whaling vessels out of Dartmouth, MA. In these
    letters, Jerauld solicits the command of the codfishing schooner Racine and
    then reports on his activities to the owners over a period of several years.
    He describes the advantages and costs of hand-line fishing using clams as
    bait on 3 February and 24 March 1879. His first report from out of port was
    2 June 1879 from remote Sable Island, a hundred miles south of Nova Scotia.
    While back in port, he checked in on Potter's tenants and cranberry bogs:
    "On one lot I found only 3 berries, the vineworm having spoiled the vines;
    the other lot is very lightly fruited, it being overgrown with grass and
    rushes" (23 September 1879). 5 June 1881 found him at Bank Quereau off
    Maine, contending with gales, scarcity, and a sea "covered with French
    vessels." The next year he went out again "carrying 10 boats and 11 hands,"
    hoping to receive a new seine net which "will run three years without much
    expense except a little tar to preserve the twine." On 22 February 1882 he
    expressed disappointment at the lack of proceeds from sale of fish: "My crew
    (or sharesmen) are dissatisfied and have obtained legal advice . . . and
    will hold you responsible for their part of loss. . . . My crew are all of
    them poor men and need what money they have made for family use." On 19
    February 1883 he requests gear: "Get No. 13, Job Johnson's hook. Such hooks
    as I had last season I won't have. They were manufactured in Connecticut and
    good for nothing." After another poor payout, Jerauld wrote on 5 March 1885:
    "How about us poor fishermen that have been down to the Banks and eat fogg,
    endured the hardships of a fisherman life, spent our time & the result of
    which is worse than nothing." He concludes with a full-page sketch of the
    ship's seine net. In the final April 1886 letter, facing increasing
    difficulty in wresting profit from the cod fishery, Jerauld has arranged to
    sell Potter's boat and seine for $125. <br><br>WITH--3 letters to Edward
    Potter from other ship captains, George E. Gould and Thomas Kendrick,

    army's pay department, writes to a friend back home with a harrowing war
    story. He found himself in Puebla far from the front lines on 12 August,
    waiting to join a reserve unit, when "a party of Mexican lancers come about
    the town and stole about 50 mules. . . . We thought we would go out and
    drive them off and retake the mules. On arriving at the yard, we found a
    party of about 40 Mexicans. . . . Our party consisted on 35 men all told,
    made up of clearks of the different departments, some teamsters, some waggon
    masters. We all volunteered for to go. . . . Thay then retreated. We
    followed them as fast as posible, killing about one every rod. We followed
    round a hill when we came in contact with about 400 mounted men. . . . We
    were surounded and cut up in a most shocking manner. Out of 35 men, but 6
    war left alive. 3 of them made their escape by running through the woods. .
    . . Myself and 2 more war taken prisoners and taken to the Mexican camp."
    Page was stripped of his money, watch, hat, and "evry thing but my
    panterloons and shirt. . . . About 3 o'clock they began to rig a gallows to
    hang us." When one of his comrades made an attempt to escape, his own guards
    became distracted. "I thought I mite as well be shot as hung, so I started
    to run and made for some long grass that was close by. . . . I looked and
    saw 2 men looking for me. I could not move for fear of being seen. . . .
    They come within about a rod of me. . . . I herd a gun go off and I supose
    the man that tried to run away was shot, but it was the means of saving my
    life." <br><br>Page somehow made his way back to Puebla and helped bury 20
    of the dead men from his impromptu unit. Then he was rushed out to join the
    final campaign on Mexico City. He arrived in time for the Battles of
    Contreras and Churubusco, but was too worn out from his exertions to fight,
    so he was assigned to hospital duty: "I was helping the doctors dress the
    wounds of the wounded, and we had a bisey time of it, I tell you. I help
    Doctor Head cut off 123 lages and 94 armes in them 2 days. . . . It was a
    most horrible site. . . . Harder battles I supose was never fot in any
    country. . . . On the morning of the 20, Gen'l Scott formed his army in line
    of battle and told them that the thing must be don sooner or later, and it
    mite as well do it at once. . . . It would do you good to see the Mexicans
    fall in the street, we would fill our cannon full of grape shot and fire and
    bring about 20 every time. Our army don well, beginning with the 19th of
    August and ending the 14th of Sept., this army has gallantly fought its way
    through the fields and forts of Contreras, San Antonia, Churubusco, Molino
    del Rey, Chapultepec, and the gates of San Cosme and Tacubaya into the

    General Orders on the court martial and executions of the San Patricios who
    had defected to Mexico.
  TYPESET: >-
    3 items, total of 7 pages on 5 disbound leaves, each 7½ x 4¾ inches, all
    issued "by command of Major General Scott" and all but one signed by his
    aide-de-camp and son-in-law Henry Lee Scott (1814-1886); minor wear, later
    page numbers added in ink, 3 holes punched in inner margin of first order.
  at-a-glance: 'Tacubaya, Mexico, 8-10 September 1847'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    During the Mexican War, a substantial number of American troops deserted and
    fought for Mexico. Most of them were recent immigrants and/or Irish
    Catholics who were disillusioned by American xenophobia, and sympathetic to
    Mexico and its established Catholic Church. Reorganized as the Saint
    Patrick's Battalion or Batallón de San Patricio, they became one of the
    hardest-fighting units in the Mexican Army. Most were killed or captured at
    the 20 August 1847 Battle of Churubusco, with the prisoners swiftly
    court-martialed. <br><br>Offered here are three General Orders (281, 282,
    and 283) setting forth the result of the two Court Martial sessions, all
    issued by General Winfield Scott from the Headquarters of the Army. 65
    prisoners are named, along with their original regiments. The majority of
    the names are clearly Irish, with numerous German names interspersed as
    well. The first order, dated 8 September, commands that the bulk of the
    prisoners "be hanged by the neck until he is dead." Extenuating
    circumstances are given for several, including one "out of consideration for
    a son, a private in the same company, who has remained faithful to his
    colors." Three of the prisoners had deserted before the formal declaration
    of war, and thus could not legally be executed. Instead, they were given
    "fifty lashes with a rawhide whip, well laid on the bare back of each, and .
    . . each be branded on a cheek with the letter D, kept a close prisoner as
    long as this army remains in Mexico, and then be drummed out of service."
    One of these three, John Patrick Riley (1817-1850) (here spelled Reilly) had
    been the commander of one company of the San Patricios. Order No. 283, dated
    10 September, lists additional soldiers designated for hanging, with an
    appended note in type: "Executed September 13, 1847, at Miscoac." This was
    the date of the Battle of Chapultepec, at which the prisoners were famously
    hung in view of the battlefield so their last moments would be in witness of
    a Mexican defeat. <br><br>The execution of 50 soldiers over four days was
    the largest mass execution event in the history of the United States. The
    San Patricios and particularly John Riley are still regarded as heroes in
    Mexico.<br><br>With--a similar General Order no. 47 pardoning one "Luz Bega,
    a Mexican, charged with enticing soldiers to desert the American Standard"
    due to faulty evidence but urging that "the first clear case of conviction
    shall certainly be followed by the punishment of death according to the well
    known laws of War in such cases." Signed by Henry Lee Scott "by command of
    Major General Scott." Mexico, 7 February 1848.

    Young in August 1843, was soon named as Inspector-General of the Nauvoo
    Legion, and two months later sought to run for governor of Illinois with
    Joseph Smith's endorsement. Smith's reply was scathing--he refused to
    "pettify myself into a clown to act the farce of political demagoguery."
    Smith closed with a postscript that clearly intended to shut the door on
    Bennett's ambitions: "The court martial will attend to your case in the

    "The Indians killed the man, destroyed the goods & took the team."
    <br><br>This letter was written by Cynthia Ann Eldredge Rogers (1847-1930),
    who was born into the large Mormon community in Pottawattamie County, Iowa,
    and came to Utah as a girl. In 1863 she married the much older Ross Ransom
    Rogers (1821-1897) as his second wife. His first wife died in 1871. In 1877,
    Brigham Young directed the establishment of Utahville or Jonesville in
    Arizona Territory, and the Rogers family became part of the original
    settlement (it was soon renamed Lehi, and was later absorbed into the city
    of Mesa near Phoenix). There Cynthia raised a large combined family--the
    1880 census lists 11 children at home from both mothers, with 5 more to be
    born to her through 1890. Despite the gloomy tone of this letter, she spent
    the rest of her life in Arizona. <br><br>The letter offers updates on five
    of the family's children, most of them the adult children of her husband's
    first wife. She describes ongoing conflicts in the decades-long Apache Wars.
    The Battle of Fort Apache had taken place just 29 days earlier: "The Indians
    have broke out in the eastern part of this territory & New Mexico. They have
    killed some citizens & some soldiers. The last word we got, they had got
    them quelled. . . . George is in New Mexico herding Indians. Charley lent
    his team to a man to haul some goods. The Indians killed the man, destroyed
    the goods & took the team."<br><br>Rugged frontier conditions are suggested
    in several passages: "The Salt & Gila Rivers have been booming high. They
    are down now. The result is there is large amounts of freight at Maricopa
    for all parts of the teritory & everybody is going to make their fortune
    freighting. Ross has just gone to Tempe with a load of barley." She notes
    that "Mrs. Biggs is in Phoenix plying her trade as a nurse" and hints at
    scurrilous gossip surrounding her stepdaughter Theodocia: "Docia is living
    with Mrs. Collins 12 miles from Joseph place. There is great tales round
    here about her, but they originated with the Jones crowd. Of course, misery
    loves company."

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    William Samuel "Billy" Gussak (1906-1992) was a rock and jazz drummer, best
    known for his session work on Bill Haley's 1954 hit "Rock Around the Clock."
    Two of these albums are largely devoted to his musical career, with Gussak's
    captions and notations. They begin with a 1922 shot of his first band, the
    Big Time Novelty Band (he notes "it was a novelty if we got paid"). A 1925
    shot shows him in uniform with a baseball team in Tannersville, NY. Several
    shots place him in Havana, and he also played with bands on steamship
    cruises, often in ridiculous costumes as part of masquerade nights. The
    albums show Gussak on the road as late as 1968, when he is seen with José
    Ferrer in a production of "Man of La Mancha." Gussak was also an inventor;
    two of his percussion patents dated 1966 and 1971 are included, and one
    photo shows him with his "1st invention, the Guzzake, 1938." Several
    snapshots show Gussak demonstrating his percussion devices. <br><br>Also
    included are family albums with photographs extending from the 1890s through
    1982, some showing his parents before their emigration from Russia, through
    his childhood in Brooklyn, and his later life in Deal, NJ.

    "Have lookouts stationed about the ship to look out for fire rafts & boats."
    <br><br>James Cara Williamson (1813-1871) of Jersey City, NJ enlisted in the
    Navy as a midshipman in 1832, and worked his way up through the ranks,
    reaching the rank of Captain in 1862. These orders span the first 28 years
    of his career. <br><br>An 11 October 1836 message from the New York Navy
    Yard orders him to "report to Capt. [Matthew Calbraith] Perry & Professor
    Ward for the purpose of attending the Naval School at this yard." As a
    lieutenant in the Mexican War, on 14 January 1848 he was ordered to "proceed
    without delay to Vera Cruz via New Orleans and report to Commo. Perry for
    duty in the Home Squadron." Two documents were drafted by the officers of
    the USS St. Louis in the harbor at Montevideo, Uruguay in 1850: one
    memorializing two officers who had just died of yellow fever, and the other
    forming an officer's social club, signed by 7 officers.<br><br>Williamson
    was in the East India Squadron during the Second Opium War. Included in this
    lot is an order from the first day of the Battle of the Pearl River Forts,
    16 November 1856, from Commodore James Armstrong, appointing Williamson as
    temporary commander of the flagship USS San Jacinto: "You will have a supply
    of muskets and pistols kept loaded and in readiness for immediate use, and
    will have lookouts stationed about the ship to look out for fire rafts &
    boats." Ten days later, after the Americans had captured three Chinese
    forts, Armstrong ordered him "to proceed on the next trip of the steamer Cum
    Fa to the barrier forts and will on your arrival there report yourself to
    Commanders Foote and Bell for duty." On 13 January 1857, Williamson
    protested that he had not been given command of his rightful battery of
    artillery when "a warlike demonstration has been made on the Chinese by this
    squadron." <br><br>The lot includes Letters Signed by ten Secretaries of the
    Navy: Mahlon Dickerson (10), James Kirke Paulding (4), Abel Upshur (2),

    Oliver Holmes the 3rd (1777-1833) spent most of his life in Francestown, NH.
    He was not a close relation of the later poet or judge of the same name. At
    the time of this diary, he was an unmarried young man, working
    intermittently as a school teacher, farm laborer, sign painter, and runner
    of errands. The diary begins with a long and colorful account of an 8-day
    horseback journey to Boston and back through a heavy snowstorm. In Roxbury,
    MA he was compelled to share a bed with "a small lad . . . troubled with
    dreams or haveing drank too much liquor," and in Sharon, MA he delayed his
    departure to watch the drawing of a lottery.<br><br>Holmes resumed teaching
    at his local school on 7 January 1799, which inspired an interesting 3-page
    description of his frustrations: "Began the tiresome business of school
    teaching once more, for the paltry sum of ten dollars. . . . Repetitions
    must be made use of, repeated and forlorn. Repetitions loaded with threats
    and perplexities. Some will whisper & laugh, some pull hair and if you
    correct them, some shew their good breeding that they have been accustomed

    Many New Yorkers have fond memories of childhood visits to the American
    Museum of Natural History, and particularly the timeless lifelike dioramas
    in the Hall of African Mammals, which were created in the 1930s. Many or
    most of the photographs in this volume show the development of these
    dioramas, from modeling through completion. Several photographs show exhibit
    preparators at work on the dioramas. <br><br>At least 6 photos have captions
    on verso which place them at the American Museum of Natural History--and the
    compiler as one of the artists. For example, the okapi exhibit is captioned
    "Did some of the modelling and all the accessory work and background (this
    is a sketch model). American Museum of Natural History between 1928-31.
    Okapi (figures about 5 in high)." One photograph is captioned "assistant to
    Robert Rockwell on five of these buffalo," and another reads "Assistant to
    Louis Jonas on water hole group and Asiatic elephants." Robert Rockwell and
    Louis Paul Jonas were both longtime Museum of Natural History exhibit
    makers, and are both members of the Taxidermy Hall of Fame. Many of the
    photos, including those identified as Natural History Museum images, are
    stamped by photographer Meredith D. Burch (1905-1932), a Museum of Natural
    History staffer who was involved in exhibit preparation and taxidermy.
    <br><br>At least a few photographs are from other museum projects, or were
    included as reference material. At the beginning of the volume are 4 mostly
    industrial dioramas for a Texas Works Projects Administration project from
    1936, one of them showing the Hoover Dam. One mine diorama is inscribed "Did
    the mules and most of mine interior, Dept. of Interior, Texas Centennial."
    Later in the volume, one naval diorama scene is stamped on front and back by
    C.R. Porteus of the Public Museum in Milwaukee, WI. Two 1936 newspaper
    clippings describe other diorama projects in Washington.

    John Dunlap Wells (1815-1903) graduated from New York's Union College and
    the Princeton Theological Seminary, and spent most of his life as pastor of
    South Third Street Presbyterian Church in the Williamsburg neighborhood of
    Brooklyn. By the time of these diaries, his son Newell Woolsey Welles
    supported him there as junior pastor. He was active in missionary causes,
    including the New York State Colonization Society which (at this point)
    raised funds for Liberia. On 9 January 1890, a church he had recently helped
    dedicate collapsed, "crushing a two-story wooden house in which were seven
    persons. A young girl about 16 years old, a member of that church, and her
    brother 14 yrs old in the Sunday School were killed, and all were wounded."
    He sometimes discusses the rougher-edged Brooklynites who fell under his
    pastoral care, such as unmarried pregnant women who needed to be wed in a
    hurry; on 16 September 1894 "attended the funeral of Mr. Roe who said just
    before his death 'I am a good man, I have never done any wrong,' and yet he
    was a policy man & his place had been raided by the police. I made no
    allusion to him but tried to comfort the sorrowing." On the other end of the
    spectrum, he pays a visit to the home of famed anti-vice crusader Anthony
    Comstock in Summit, NJ on 25 January 1896. Wells celebrated fifty years at
    South Third in January 1900. <br><br>The Reverend's daughter Louisa Wells
    married a Brooklyn sugar magnate, James Howell Post, and the Reverend spent
    most of each summer at their estate in Brookhaven, Long Island. There he
    indulged in suburban delights such as lawn care, built a 30-foot observatory
    in July 1890, and frequently preached at local churches. On 18 August 1895
    he officiated at a funeral at the nearby Poospatuck Reservation of the
    Unkechaugi band: "I went with Mr. Bisbie to the Indian & Negro settlement
    near Mastic to attend a funeral. We found on reaching the place that it was
    the funeral of a Negro man, a husband & father who was drowned while
    returning with a companion (both drunk) from a gathering of some kind where
    he had played the violin. . . . The father & brother of the drowned man had
    been drinking heavily & a cousin fell asleep as soon as he sat down, and
    though I shook him, he could not be roused." <br><br>The Rev. Wells was a
    cousin of the Roosevelt family, particularly New York politician Clinton
    Roosevelt (1804-1898), who was a second cousin to Theodore Roosevelt. The
    relationship of Wells to Theodore Roosevelt is unclear, but tipped into the
    diary is a 17 November 1898 Theodore Roosevelt Letter Signed on letterhead
    of the Republican State Committee: "Hearty thanks. Your letter has been a
    genuine pleasure to me." Also included is a lone letter written by John
    Dunlap Wells to his cousin Minerva Dunlap from the Princeton Seminary, 11
    January 1842. Provenance: found among the papers of great-granddaughter
    Dorothy Post Jones Hubert.

    This volume documents the work of a stud horse named Traveler owned by a
    member of the famed Gardiner family of New York. Traveler's owner John
    Griswold Gardiner (1812-1861) was the Ninth Proprietor of Gardiner's Island,
    a small island off the eastern tip of Long Island which has been in
    possession of the Gardiner family from 1639 through today. <br><br>These
    records were kept by Abraham Baker Dayton (1820-1898), who in later years
    worked as a carpenter in East Hampton, NY. He began keeping the horse on 30
    April 1839, charging "2 dollars a leap, 4 dollars the season, 6 dollars to
    warrant." Traveler saw 31 mares through 11 June before he "went on the
    island" (presumably Gardiner's Island) for the season. The owners of each
    mare are named, along with the coloration of the mare, and amount paid.
    Against this are small costs deducted by Baker for a halter, shoeing and
    other expenses. Traveler returned to Dayton's care for the spring of 1840,
    with an additional option of 8 dollars for a guaranteed living colt. He saw
    57 mares before he once again "went on the island." On the final page, in
    February 1841 John G. Gardiner (the Proprietor) signs for $23 paid for the
    season by Jeremiah Dayton (1783-1867), Abraham's father.

    Dorothy Post Hubert (1918-2021) was the granddaughter of sugar magnate James
    Howell Post (1859-1938) and was raised in Brookhaven in eastern Long Island,
    graduating from Vassar in 1939. In 1941, she married a Presbyterian
    minister, Curtis Knowles Jones (1911-1989), and they lived in Charleston,
    WV; New Kensington, PA; Brookville, PA; and Daretown, NJ though 1976, when
    they retired to Brookhaven. She served on the board of the Post-Morrow
    Foundation, a local conservation fund founded by her aunt. <br><br>This
    collection includes 17 diaries kept by Dorothy Jones from 1944 to 1982. The
    5 yearly diaries from 1944 to 1948 are most extensive, in large octavo
    volumes with detailed entries kept in Charlestown, WV. She often comments on
    news events (such as "two attacks on Jap cities with 'atomic' bombs with
    unbelievable force" on 9 August 1945) and food shortages in the local
    markets during and after the war. In an entry from 1 April 1946, a friend
    tells an anecdote from Denmark during the German occupation: "The guards
    distributed the crown jewels among a party of tourists who were viewing
    them, with instructions to return them in a week. All got back safely." The
    polio epidemic is frequently noted. Some of the later diaries cover travel,
    including a long Asian trip in 1980. <br><br>Also included are boxes of her
    personal correspondence from 1928 onward, with 4 thick packets of letters
    written home from Vassar, 1935-1939. Among the extensive genealogical notes
    are several folders devoted to her father Philip Arthur Hubert (1881-1969)
    of Bellport, NY and his family, including notes on (and copies of
    correspondence and diaries of) great-grandfather Philip G. Hubert
    (1830-1922), a noted New York architect and critic; and typescript short
    stories and essays by grandfather Philip G. Hubert Jr. (1852-1925). An
    original 1923 personal letter to "Brother Hubert" from music critic Henry T.
    Finck is included. The older tradition of manuscript newspapers is carried
    on with a typescript of a Hubert family production called "The Barnstead
    News" from Summit, NJ, August 1944. A group of 8 mounted early 20th-century
    snapshots apparently shows mother Helen Marion Post Hubert (1890-1973)

    directly and radically at variance with our institutions, and always at war
    with the cause of freedom, and whereas the mass of such foreign population .

    influence upon the institutions of our country. . . . Whatever shall be
    done, shall be kept a profound secret from those that have not been

    citizen of the United States of America, born of protestant parents, himself
    as Protestant, and not married to a Roman Catholic wife." The presidents of
    the subsidiary county and town councils are given the authority to "select
    the passwords to be used by the members thereof." The final page is signed
    in type by secretary B.F. Romaine--the only name to appear in the volume.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This letter traces the latest developments in the complex and contentious
    presidential election of 1800, which made Bush v. Gore look like a Sunday
    picnic. Uriah Tracy (1755-1807) and his correspondent McHenry were both
    Federalists opposed to the candidacy of Thomas Jefferson in the 1800
    election. McHenry had served in the cabinet of Jefferson's rival Adams,
    although he had been forced to resign after undermining the president. By
    the time Tracy sent this update, the two Democratic-Republican candidates
    Jefferson and Burr had finished dead even in the Electoral College ahead of
    the Federalist Adams, throwing the election into the hands of the House of
    Representatives, who were to tally one vote per state. Tracy, whose party
    had already lost the contest, took what pleasure he could in seeing the
    Jefferson supporters in a state of confusion: "It is now officially
    ascertained that Jefferson & Burr have each 73 votes for Prest. & Vice
    Prest., and that the Democrats are in a sweat, is also ascertained, but not
    officially, unless you consider my assertion as official. They are in the
    most violent state of apprehension, for fear Burr will be chosen, or at any
    rate that Jefferson will not. . . . It is really pleasant to see the
    Democrats in such a rage for having acted with good faith, they swear they
    will never do it again, & mutually criminate each other for having done so
    now." He expected Burr to emerge victorious: "Burr is a cunning man. If he
    cannot outwit all the Jeffersonians I do not know the man." Speaking for his
    own Federalist party, Tracy seemed to embrace Burr with a shudder over their
    old enemy Jefferson: "The Federalists say, they like not either of the
    Candidates, but as the anti's have brought them forward, they will take the
    least of two evils." <br>This letter is a well-known inside source on one of
    the most important elections in American history. It was published in 1907
    in The Life and Correspondence of James McHenry, 483-4, and has been quoted
    in many histories since. A full transcript is provided. Provenance: Swann

    Earl R. Miller (1897-1973) was a New York State Trooper who served as
    Eleanor Roosevelt's bodyguard from 1928 to 1932, while she was the First
    Lady of New York. The two were undeniably close friends; we will probably
    never know whether the persistent rumors of a romantic relationship were
    accurate. Eleanor's shadow loomed over all three of Miller's failed
    marriages. He initially married to quiet the rumors: "That's why I got
    married in 1932 with plenty of publicity. I got married with someone I
    wasn't in love with. Same with the second marriage. But I was never
    successful in killing the gossip." During the divorce proceedings for his
    third marriage in 1947, his wife threatened to share incriminating
    correspondence between Earl and Eleanor. <br><br>Offered here is the wedding
    book kept as a memento of Earl's first wedding, to Ruth T. Bellinger,
    shortly before Franklin Roosevelt was first elected to the presidency. The
    witnesses were Eleanor's daughter Anna Roosevelt Dall and her son Elliott
    Roosevelt. Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt were the first to sign the guest
    book, before the families of the bride and groom. Other noteworthy guests
    included Franklin's mother Sara Delano Roosevelt; Franklin's sister-in-law
    Elizabeth Riley Roosevelt; Franklin's longtime personal secretaries Grace
    Tully and Marguerite "Missy" LeHand (who had her own rumors to contend
    with); Franklin's close associate Samuel Rosenman, who coined the term "New
    Deal"; John Boettiger, a reporter who would soon wed the Roosevelts'
    daughter Anna; Franklin's bodyguard Gus Gennerich; Eleanor's private
    secretary Malvina Scheider; The Roosevelts' younger sons Franklin Jr. and
    John; Eleanor's close friends Marion Dickerman and Nancy Cook; and Roosevelt
    biographer Ernest Lindley.

    This pro-Dewey campaign piece hoped to peel off some of Roosevelt's Black

    Truman is portrayed as a segregationist with the support of the likes of
    Theodore Bilbo. Roosevelt is attacked for his "sordid record of racial
    injustice," particularly the treatment of soldiers in the World War, while
    the Republican challenger Thomas Dewey hoped to "blaze a new trail of
    justice and integration." It is illustrated with numerous photographs and 3
    topical cartoons by popular illustrator Clare Barnes Jr. We trace no other

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    A crudely printed satirical newspaper, written in minstrel-show dialect and
    purporting to be edited by one Pluto Jumbo. It displays a deep resentment of
    the Republican Party and the new engagement of freed African Americans in
    the political and legal system. Its masthead states that it was printed in
    New York, and its obsession with New York war supporters Henry Ward Beecher,
    Horace Greeley and James Gordon Bennett suggests that it actually was a New
    York Copperhead production. Typical items include a proposed law "agin
    marriage between two pussons of de same color" and a poorly executed
    portrait of "Caesar Guss, the Presidential Candidate." At least 3 other
    issues were produced (numbered #2 through #4), all dated August and
    September 1865. This was apparently the first issue. The Boston Courier ran
    a mocking blurb about the Black Republican in August 1865, treating it as an
    actual newspaper. That squib was republished in at least 11 newspapers over
    the next year, reaching as far as England and California. No examples of any
    issue have been traced at auction since 1923.

    With Louisiana under Federal control and Reconstruction in full swing, a new
    state constitution was ratified in March 1868 which created voting rights
    for freedmen and integrated public schools. It remained in place until the
    end of Reconstruction, when it was superseded by a "home rule" constitution
    in 1879 which restricted the voting rights of freedmen. <br><br>This
    composite shows 95 of the 98 men who drafted Louisiana's new constitution in
    1867. Fully half of the delegates were African-American. Most prominent
    among the delegates would prove to be Pinckney B.S. Pinchback (1837-1921),
    who had served as a captain in the Civil War and in 1872 would become
    Louisiana's acting governor--the first Black governor in the nation's
    history. He is seen on the far right, four rows from the top, in a portrait
    which is not widely known and may be his earliest surviving image.

    This volume is lavishly extra-illustrated with 19 Autograph Letters Signed,
    9 clipped signatures, 2 other manuscripts, 15 engravings (including views
    and portraits), 14 photographs, and 4 pieces of printed ephemera.
    <br><br>The most important insertion is the broadside program for the
    university's first commencement ceremony held on 7 September 1769, the only
    one at its original location in Warren, RI when it was still known as Rhode
    Island College. Titled "Benevolentissimo ac eximia virtute, doctrinaque
    utilissima prædito, viro, Stephano Hopkins," it lists the seven members of
    the college's first graduating class including future Continental Army
    general James Mitchell Varnum. It is trimmed and has short separations at
    its folds. Only 3 copies are traced in OCLC, and none at auction.
    <br><br>The most important manuscript insertion is a fragment of a letter
    signed twice each by Rhode Island's delegation to Continental Congress,
    Stephen Hopkins and Samuel Ward. Only the second leaf is present. It begins
    with a denunciation of an unknown Rhode Islander who has "the good of his
    country so little at heart as to not only decline entering into her service,
    but to violate her most sacred resolutions and endeavor to fix a stigma on
    the colony which gave him birth & hath always afforded him protection." This
    unnamed scoundrel would appear to be a supporter of the slave trade, as they
    add that "Mr. Ward's sentiments & conduct relative to the slave trade are so
    universally known that it is unnecessary to say anything on that head." They
    go on to discuss a Congressional resolution on the price of West India
    goods, and discuss defenses for the coming war campaign: "Our enemies will
    make their greatest possible efforts against us early in the spring. We have
    therefore no time to loose, but ought to improve every moment in making all
    possible preparations for the defence of the colonies in general, and for
    our own immediate defence in particular." They close with a postscript
    regarding their Congressional salaries. The letter has two full separations
    at the folds, and 6 other early paper repairs to the other folds. The
    famously shaky signature of Stephen Hopkins is desirable because he also
    signed the Declaration of Independence. The fragment is undated, but would
    seem to date from the first three months of 1776 (Ward died on 26 March
    1776). <br><br>Another dramatic manuscript is a letter by Judge Daniel
    Jenckes (1701-1774) to his brother-in-law Cornelius Esten (1699-1776)
    regarding the death of Esten's son at sea near Pernambuco: "I heard of the
    sloop being to sword, and Cap. Easton dead, died soon after he came out. . .
    . Cap. Charles Holden of Warwick who sailed about the same time your son did
    for Serronam [Surinam?] fell to sword and a littel to windword of Berbishus
    . . . your son died a few days after he left Providence. . . . I greatly
    lament the death of my cousin who I thought would have made a likely man had
    he a lived to riper years." Providence, 20 March 1754. <br><br>Among the
    other manuscripts are letters by Judge David Howell, Senator Asher Robbins,
    the school's namesake Nicholas Brown Jr., Congressman Horace Binney, George
    William Curtis, Senator Henry Bowen Anthony, and two from Senator John Brown
    Francis. <br><br>Provenance: the compiler was apparently Horatio Gates Jones
    Jr. (1822-1893), a Philadelphia politician, who received an honorary degree
    from Brown in 1863; his father graduated from Brown in 1812. The volume was
    later the property of the Crozer Theological Seminary, and then
    deaccessioned.

    Thomas Hall Garrett (1830-1905) graduated from the University of
    Pennsylvania, and then became a partner in a prominent Philadelphia
    analytical chemistry lab with a better-known chemist, James Curtis Booth.
    Clients brought in samples--coal, textiles, fertilizer, brass, vinegar,
    paint, guano, petroleum, etc.--and Garrett reported on the chemical
    composition. Various kinds of ore made up a substantial part of the
    business, particularly gold, silver, lead (galena) and iron. These notebooks
    list the client name, substance, date, and detailed notes on Garrett's
    findings. An extensive analysis of the water supply of Wilmington, DE was
    undertaken in November 1863. <br><br>The first three volumes were compiled
    during the Civil War, and the firm did occasional work for the Union Army's
    Frankford Arsenal in Philadelphia. On 2 November 1863, its commandant Major
    Theodore Laidley brought in a gunpowder sample, which was determined to
    contain 0.01% sodium chloride (salt) by Garrett's partner Booth, who
    initialed the entry. Similarly, more gunpowder samples were brought in on 1
    February and 10 March 1865, also handled by Booth. These were delivered by
    Laidley's successor Captain Stephen Vincent Benét (grandfather of the noted
    author of the same name), who also brought in batches of saltpeter on 20
    March and 23 May 1865.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The first American patent was issued in 1790, and the number issued in
    following years was modest. Patent holders would attempt to capitalize by
    licensing their new discoveries to manufacturers across the country. The
    first American patent for a washing machine was issued to Nathaniel Briggs
    in 1797. Less is known about the second washing machine patent, issued to
    Ezra Weld of Braintree, MA on 26 June 1799. The original patent papers have
    long since been lost to fire. However, Weld had contract forms printed to
    set forth the terms of his standard agreement. <br><br>Offered here is one
    of Weld's license agreements for "the exclusive right and liberty of making,
    using, and vending to others to be used, his new and useful improvement,
    called Lavater and Wringer, for the washing and wringing of clothes." The
    license was granted by Weld's son Elias Weld (1772-1863) to Captain James
    Chute of Rowley, MA for a period of 14 years "in the towns of Rowley,
    Ipswich, Gloucester, Hambleton [Hamilton], Manchester, Wenham, and the
    parish of Byfield"--a large portion of Essex County north of Salem. For
    these rights, Chute paid a fee of $214 on 18 March 1800.

    Photograph of the Warren, PA team featuring Honus Wagner--possibly his

    Printing-out paper print, 7¼ x 8½ inches, with inked stamp of photographer
    "L.P. Green---" on verso; quite worn, with cello tape repairs on recto and
    verso, a 4-inch closed tear, creases, moderate soiling, two large edge
    chips, a later ballpoint pen inscription, and modern price tag on verso.
  at-a-glance: 'Warren, PA, circa 12-16 July 1895'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This battered team photograph shows John "Honus" Wagner at the top
    right--and may be the earliest photograph of the legend in uniform. This was
    his first year in professional baseball; after a long career with the
    Pittsburgh Pirates, he is still regarded by consensus as the greatest
    shortstop who ever lived. <br><br>Warren, the county seat of Warren County
    in northwestern Pennsylvania, was part of the Iron and Oil League, a
    low-level minor league. The Warren Evening Democrat is available through
    newspapers.com, so by tracing the team's roster changes from day to day, we
    can develop a chronology. Al "Butts" Wagner, older brother of John / Honus,
    joined the team on 4 June. John first appeared in the lineup on 12 July. We
    believe the present image dates from circa 13 July, shortly after John
    joined the team. On 29 July, he badly injured his arm while running to catch
    a train, and was out of the lineup for almost 4 weeks, reappearing on 24
    August. The team dispersed for the season on 18 September. <br><br>A
    well-preserved Warren team photograph from later in 1895, also showing John
    Wagner, hammered for $15,000 at Heritage Auctions in 2007. That image was
    carefully captioned with the names of all players. Several of them can be
    easily spotted in the present photograph. At top left is catcher Harry
    Smith, who later joined Wagner as a back-up catcher on the 1902-1907
    Pirates; then second baseman Claude Ritchey, who would become Wagner's
    long-time double play partner in Pittsburgh; then a tall unidentified player
    at center whose face is obscured, perhaps pitcher Tom Vickery; then future
    Giants pitcher Bill Carrick, holding a ball as pitchers often did in
    19th-century team photographs; and at right John "Honus" Wagner, glaring
    with hands on his hips. The middle row has a first baseman named Russell,
    who debuted with Warren on July 12; an unidentified player holding a ball,
    possibly left-handed pitcher Dave "Toots" Barrett, the only one of the
    team's mid-July pitchers with no other known image; Manager Franklin,
    wearing the same suit as in his Heritage photograph; and two unidentified
    players (possibly July mainstays Jakie Bullock and Jack Schrader, who left
    the team after 19 August and 7 August, respectively). Seated at left is
    pitcher Jake Hewitt, who left the team on 16 July, and pitched in 4 games
    for Pittsburgh in August--he is not in the Heritage photograph, but a grainy
    surviving photograph of him on Baseball Reference is a perfect match.
    Another unidentified player sits at front center, possibly outfielder
    Rickert from the Heritage photo, although it's a shaky match, and at right
    is Al "Butts" Wagner, brother of Honus. A family member inscribed Butts's
    image in ballpoint pen: "Uncle Al Wagner." The Heritage photograph features
    several players who joined the team later than 16 July, including former
    major leaguer Gus McGinnis, who only played with the team on 23 August. The
    photographer Louis P. Greenlund (1868-1926), whose worn inked stamp appears
    on verso, is frequently mentioned in Warren newspapers from 1893 to 1898.

  at-a-glance: 'London, 1927-1929 and undated'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    As part of the long effort to spread baseball throughout the globe, the
    Anglo-American Baseball Association was founded in 1918 by expatriates
    hoping to develop an English audience for the American national game. Games
    were played at the Stamford Bridge Grounds in the western part of London,
    which was (and is) the home of the venerable Chelsea Football Club. Many of
    the players were drawn from the crews of visiting American steamships and
    naval vessels. 19th-century American baseball star Arlie Latham was one of
    the founders of the league and served as the primary umpire. <br><br>This
    collection belonged to Irving Hedley "Eddie" Jones (1899-1980) of Califon,
    NJ, a 3rd Engineer on the S.S. Leviathan and third baseman for the New York
    Leviathans. It includes: <br><br>Program-scorecard for a 4 August 1929 match
    between the New York Leviathans and the London Americans. 24 pages, octavo;
    minor wear and a bit of rust at the staples. Includes a rudimentary
    introduction to the rules and strategies of baseball, a short notice of an
    impending visit by Ty Cobb, a scorecard listing all players and their home
    states (plus Umpire Latham), the year's schedule, and a stadium map on the
    rear wrapper. <br><br>8 photographs (6 period prints and 2 later copy
    prints), various sizes. Most are team or group photographs of the Leviathan
    / United States Lines team in uniform; most have extensive captioning on
    verso. One shows Jones standing alone in front of a primitive scoreboard in
    July 1927, while a copy print shows a batter swinging during a game in
    progress. Many of the players are identified in the captions; one explains
    that "this team mostly Engine Room personnel" and another identifies the
    players by their shipboard roles rather than their playing positions.
    Another dated July 1927 names all of the players, adding "We won 18-9."
    <br><br>Baseball bat, Spalding Frankie Frisch model, 34 inches long, handle
    wrapped with tape, with worn red, white and blue stripes on the barrel to
    match the stacks of the Leviathan; and two worn baseball gloves, with early

    This stallion is offered "to stand for Mares the ensuing Season, at the
    Cherry Hill Farm, near Manton, in Johnston, R.I." for "$10 a leap, $15 the
    season, $25 to insure." He is described in loving detail, including two
    generations of pedigree. We are assured: "His speed I will challenge any and
    all standing Stallions of his age to beat. He is pronounced by those who see
    him, to be the best Stallion of his age, for style, activity and
    intelligence." Another trotting stallion, General Allen, is also offered.
    The date is not given, but Dick was foaled in May 1861. The broadside was
    issued by Dick's owner, George W. White (1826-1898), who also offers his
    services in "curing Horses of all Bad Tricks, and instruct them to perform
    Feats which are witnessed with admiration." For those interested in doing

    Thomas Coleman Ryall (1809-1897) and his wife Elizabeth Scudder Ryall
    (1819-1857) had roots in Freehold, NJ but became farmers in Shelbyville, TN.
    This family archive contains numerous letters from friends and family in
    both places, reflecting sectional tensions before and during the Civil War.
    <br><br>Slavery and the Civil War are not the primary topics of these
    letters, but could hardly be ignored. Brother Daniel Bailey Ryall of
    Freehold, NJ discusses the difficulty of using enslaved people as collateral
    for loans in a 4 November 1858 letter: "As to borrowing money here, dear
    brother, on Negro property at the south on reasonable terms, here it is out
    of the question. They like security that has no legs & can't at all events
    run away." In the Civil War, although Shelbyville was known as a Union town,
    son Walter Ryall served on the Confederate side. An 11 July 1864 letter
    seeks his release: "I have applied to Gov'r [Andrew] Johnson for his release
    & hope he will use his influence in Watty's favor." An 8 January 1864 letter
    to Shelbyville arrived in a censored envelope marked "Examined, A.N. Dell,
    Capt. & Provo. Mar." <br><br>Some of the letters discuss Whig and Democratic
    politics, including one from noted Mississippi politician and orator
    Seargent Smith Prentiss, agreeing to speak at a Whig convention in
    Nashville. Vicksburg, MS, 25 July 1844; and from Congressman Joseph Reed
    Ingersoll of Pennsylvania, attacking presidential candidate "Mr. Polk's
    pretensions as a protectionist," Philadelphia, 10 August 1844. <br><br>The
    archive also contains good travel letters. Elizabeth's brother James
    Lockhart Scudder describes a visit to Lexington, KY at length, including
    plans for the funeral of Andrew Jackson, on 19 September 1845. Son Thomas
    Jr. writes from Meriden, MS on 16 September 1867, describing how he ran out
    of money and was arrested by the ticket agent on spurious charges of theft.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This textile commemorates Washington's decision to retire from public
    office. His decision to decline a third term as president set a long and
    venerable precedent, and set the tone that the presidency was not a lifetime
    appointment. His famous Farewell Address first appeared in a 19 September
    1796 newspaper, and is still read aloud in the Senate on Washington's
    Birthday each year. <br><br>A full-length portrait of Washington in military
    uniform is surrounded by seven numbered text panels. The first three offer a
    short and laudatory biography: "His late manly & noble resignation . . .
    will impress his parting & paternal instructions indelibly upon the hearts
    of his Countrymen." The four side panels contain extensive quotations from
    the Farewell Address. <br><br>This handkerchief was apparently produced
    shortly after the Farewell Address, and as Washington is spoken of in the
    present tense, it was probably produced before his 1799 death. It was
    manufactured by a Scottish firm. <br><br>Herbert Collins estimates the date
    at 1796-1800, and traces just one copy at the Smithsonian. Linda Eaton's
    2014 catalog for Winterthur estimates the date at 1800-1820. We trace none

    John Augustine Washington (1821-1861) was the great-grand-nephew of

    reacts to the news that Washington was selling Mount Vernon to the Mount
    Vernon Ladies' Association for $200,000. <br><br>"My brother mentioned that
    you would soon be in receipt of funds from the sale of Mount Vernon, which
    you remarked to him you would like to invest in real estate." Turner then
    invites Washington to join him in investing the proceeds in the Chicago Land
    Company, payable in installments in 1859, 1860, 1861, and 1862.
    <br><br>Washington did indeed invest his Mount Vernon proceeds in real

    not able to enjoy it for long--he soon became a lieutenant colonel in the
    Confederate Army, and was killed by a sharpshooter in September 1861.

    Gideon Welles (1802-1878) was chosen by President Lincoln as his Secretary
    of the Navy in 1861, and remained in office through the end of Andrew
    Johnson's term in 1869. Under his leadership, the Union Navy blockaded
    Southern ports, proceeded up the Mississippi River, and played a major role
    in crushing the Confederacy. <br><br>Welles was born and raised in
    Glastonbury, Connecticut, where he spent most of his life. He was an early
    graduate of what became Norwich University in Vermont, and returned to
    Connecticut to practice law, edit a newspaper, and serve in the state
    legislature. His highest-profile position before the Civil War was as Chief
    of the Bureau of Provisions and Clothing for the Navy during the period of
    the Mexican-American War. He opposed slavery and became an early member of
    the new Republican Party in 1854. <br><br>This large and substantial archive
    contains the personal correspondence, diaries, and manuscripts of Gideon
    Welles, as well as family correspondence, printed ephemera, and photographs.
    At the heart of the collection are 153 of his Autograph Letters Signed,
    almost all of them to his son Thomas Glastonbury Welles (1846-1892), with
    most of them written during the war years. At the outset of the war, Thomas
    was 14 years old. Shortly before Fort Sumter, Gideon urges Thomas: "The man
    who will not stand by his country in the hour of peril will not deserve
    respect" (7 April 1861). He worked to discourage Thomas from prematurely
    joining the Navy: "No man can be a ship master, or anything but a working
    drudge of a sailor--the lowest class--without an education" (9 February
    1862). While Gideon mentioned the ominous Confederate incursion into
    Maryland to Thomas, he went into more detail in a 7 September 1862 partial
    letter to his wife Mary Jane: "We have information that the Rebels had
    crossed the Upper Potomac in considerable force. . . . They are on this side
    full sixty five thousand strong, nearly one half their force having reached
    Frederick. . . . Not less than two hundred regiments passed our door last
    night between 10 and 1 o'clock. The street was a mass of living men, moving
    rapidly forward all that time."<br><br>When Thomas joined the Naval Academy
    and was posted on the famed USS Constitution for training, Gideon wrote
    "There have been many good and brave and true hearts on her deck. May you be
    as worthy" (1 October 1862). As the war progressed and Thomas matured,
    Gideon shared more insights into military matters. Shortly after the USS
    Monitor was lost in a storm, he wrote "The loss of the Monitor gave us pain,
    for she had won herself a name and character that endeared her more to us
    than a more costly vessel." In reaction to General McClellan's presidential
    campaign against Lincoln, Welles dismissed his military accomplishments: "He
    accomplished very little, and seemed indisposed to take advantage of
    success. . . . He thought more of himself than the country, and tried to
    have them engage for him rather than the war" (18 August 1864)." Thomas left
    the Naval Academy to join the Army as a young officer. Welles expressed
    concern about his new commander Godfrey Weitzel: "He has a fair reputation
    as an officer, but I have an impression that he sometimes drank more whiskey
    than he should" (10 October 1864). <br><br>Welles wrote several letters to
    Thomas during the dramatic conclusion of the war. On 14 April, the Secretary
    was (like most of the north) in a state of relief: "Last evening all
    Washington was in a blaze of illumination, fire-works and displays
    commemorative of the great victory. The truth is we have been doing little
    else than rejoicing for the last ten days." By 18 April, the mood had
    changed: "Nothing since the death of Washington has ever cast so great a
    gloom over the whole country. That one so gentle, and so kind, whose
    feelings would permit him to harm no human being, should have been so
    assaulted and slain is among the most appalling acts ever recorded." On 20
    April he offered a fuller tribute: "His gentle virtues and noble qualities
    will grow brighter with time, and the world will better appreciate him in
    the future than while he was among us. Few such men have ever lived. No
    finer or better man ever stood at the head of a nation. I knew him well and
    was honored by his friendship, and it will be one of the treasured memories
    of my life." On 25 April, he reported on his wife Mary Jane Hale Welles
    (1817-1886), one of the First Lady's closest friends: "Your mother spends a
    portion of every day with Mrs. Lincoln, who has not recovered from the
    terrible shock which prostrated her." <br><br>Gideon's 29 postwar letters to
    Thomas are also interesting, particularly for his perspective on President
    Andrew Johnson. Welles was one of Johnson's few loyal supporters in
    Washington. During the impeachment proceedings, he raged "If the Radicals by
    fraud or force or both shall attempt to continue in power against the
    popular sentiment, strife and desolation will follow. . . . I detest them
    almost as much as the secessionists" (3 May 1868). Upon Johnson's death, he
    reflected on 5 August 1875: "Johnson was an honest man, and a true
    constitutionalist, with fearless moral & physical courage."<br><br>The
    collection also contains approximately 238 letters received by Welles, the
    majority of them from family members. As a young aide-de-camp on the day
    after the Battle of the Crater, Thomas wrote a great war letter in its own
    right: "We proceeded at 3 a.m. to the trenches to await the explosion of
    Burnside's mine. . . . It arose some one or two hundred feet, sending up
    earth, stones and a whole regiment or more of rebels. . . . The darkies made
    a very good charge, but it soon became too heavy for them. . . . I was in
    front of the support and running with all my might towards what appeared
    almost certain death. It was impossible to retreat. . . . A shell struck
    within twenty feet of us, killing a captain and wounding several more. . . .
    A sudden sort of spasm succeeded by a loud explosion and finishing with a
    ringing in my ears, and a thought that I had been hit in the back of my head
    succeeded, and for ten or fifteen seconds I was perfectly insensible" (1
    August 1864). Thomas also wrote several letters in the wake of the Lincoln
    assassination, urging his father to exercise caution: "Have a sentry from
    Marine Guard at your door, and be careful who you see" (16 April 1865). A
    few of the letters are from official correspondents, including 3 from
    General Edward O.C. Ord re Thomas G. Welles joining his staff, 1864-1865;
    Robert Todd Lincoln, 1869; Horace Binney Sergeant, 1872 (requesting "the
    official facts of the expedition under Admiral Farragut against New Orleans
    and Mobile"); Edward Everett (as "E.E."), 1862, and Rear Admiral David D.
    Porter, 1864. Two anonymous letters from 1863 (24 February and 6 June)
    discuss Confederate blockade runners. <br><br>The collection includes four
    pre-war diaries by Welles, dated 1836, 1844, 1852, and 1855, all rich in
    political talk. The 1844 diary only covers two weeks in April, but is
    perhaps the most interesting. John Milton Niles (1787-1856), a political
    mentor and friend of Welles, had been elected to the United States Senate in
    1842, but before he could take office, the death of his wife triggered a
    nervous breakdown, and he was committed to an asylum. By April 1844, Niles
    had been released, and Welles accompanied him as moral support on the
    terrifying journey to Washington to assume his place in the Senate. On 11
    April, Niles made his first appearance in Congress: "Mr. Buchanan, he
    thought, & not without reason, treated him coldly. . . . Niles had hoped for
    a warm & friendly greeting from B and expected that he if anyone would
    earnestly & cordially welcome him into the Senate." Two days later, "one of
    the reporters enquired of Bigelow so loud as to have him hear, whether he
    was still crazy." On 14 April, "he told me of the delusions he had
    experienced, and seems not yet willing fully to admit they were delusions."
    This diary is a fascinating look at the perceptions of mental health
    struggles in the halls of power. The 1852 and 1855 diaries are steeped in
    local Connecticut politics and real estate deals, including repeated clashes
    with Hartford's most famous arms manufacturer: "Some talk with sundry
    persons respecting Sam Colt, who is either playing a game or is exceedingly
    stupid" (11 March 1852). In 1855, he expressed disgust at the emergence of
    the Know-Nothing Party in Connecticut: "The order of Know-Nothings held a
    state convention & nominated a ticket. Met Ezra Clark Jr. in Paine's office,
    asked him if he belonged to the order of KN, said he did not. Put the
    question three times in different forms. He unqualifiedly denied that he
    was. Yet was the evening before made their candidate for Congress" (22
    February). <br><br>A box of manuscripts by and about Welles contains some
    treasures. An undated political essay includes a long denunciation of
    President Grant: "It was a matter of amazement to me that a person who had
    his opportunities was so unfamiliar with the practical workings of our
    political system. . . . He is, beyond the ordinary run of men, deficient in
    civil administrative capacity and intelligence"; Admiral Foote said "he
    preferred Grant [above other generals] notwithstanding his insignificant
    personal appearance, provided he would let whiskey alone." Juvenile
    manuscripts go back to 1817 and probably earlier; a certificate of merit he
    received is from circa 1809. A 24-page biography of Welles in calligraphic
    hand with carte-de-visite portrait of Welles is dated September 1862; his
    quite worn commission on vellum as chief of the Bureau of Provisions is
    signed by President James Polk, 1846.<br><br>Gideon's wife Mary Jane Hale
    Welles is represented by her personal manuscript recipe book dated 1869,
    rendered more interesting by notations on her famous friends. Corn starch
    pudding and charlotte russe are noted "From Mrs. Lincoln"; corn fritters are
    marked "Pres L's favorite, Mrs. Lincoln's receipt, Mrs. Lincoln's, good"; at
    end, corn soup is marked "Pres. Johnson's" and potato soup just below is
    marked "Pres. Johnson's favorite." Also included is a manuscript invitation
    from Mr. Lincoln at the Executive Mansion (not in Lincoln's hand). Among the
    letters received by son Edgar Thaddeus Welles are 3 from Admiral David G.
    Farragut, who wrote on 28 September 1863 from Hastings, NY: "At Sabine Pass,
    the soldiers no doubt overruled the officers of the navy to violate their
    instructions. When the soldiers were sent down to Galveston by Gen'l Banks,
    I instructed them to land upon Pelican Island where the gunboats could
    protect them, instead of which Bingham & the soldiers determined to land on
    the wharf at Galveston, where they were all captured." Edgar's scrapbook of
    newspaper clippings on his father's cabinet career is also included. Other
    papers of family members include Yale essays and correspondence of
    father-in-law Elias White Hale dating back to 1792. Son Edgar was an
    autograph collector. A folder of 28 letters, clipped signatures, and
    autograph book entries includes William Seward and many other prominent
    politicians of the 1850s and 1860s. The collection also includes 62 checks
    bearing the signature of Welles, as well as 10 envelopes bearing his
    franking signature. One prized heirloom was the appointment of son Thomas
    Welles as Navy midshipman in November 1862, signed by his father as
    Secretary of the Navy. <br><br>Graphic material includes a miniature
    watercolor portrait of Welles, 4 x 2½ inches oval; approximately 95
    photographs depicting mostly family members and Civil War-era celebrities
    (most in carte-de-visite or cabinet-card formats); and an untitled and
    unsigned pencil sketch of an ironclad ship. Printed material includes an
    1831 Bible signed by Gideon Welles on flyleaf; a worn memorial pamphlet
    "State Council of Pennsylvania, O. of U.A.M., In Memoriam Abraham Lincoln,"
    gilt-stamped on front cover for "Hon. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy";
    and a broadside seating chart for Delmonico's, "Dinner to the President of
    the United States in Honor of his Visit to the City of New York, August
    29th, 1866." A pair of leather portfolios, one gilt-stamped "Gideon Welles,"
    the other "Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy," are included. For those
    anxious to know more about the shape of Welles's skull, see L.N. Fowler's
    "Synopsis of Phrenology" pamphlet annotated with a full report dated 1845.
    The family saved large quantities of invitations, calling cards, and similar
    ephemera, perhaps 200 items, from the 1820s-1870s. Many are inserted into a
    large black album. Highlights include a Civil War pass issued to "Gideon
    Welles and Friends" dated 6 May 1864; a ticket for the 1865 Grand Review of
    Troops issued by General Augur; a ticket to "Mr. Bancroft's Eulogy" on
    Lincoln in Congress, 1866; an engraved undated invitation from "The
    President" to Welles (possibly Buchanan as no wife is noted); an engraved
    invitation from Andrew Johnson to Gideon and Mrs. Welles, 8 February 1868; a
    pair of Mrs. Andrew Johnson calling cards; a pair of William Seward engraved
    invitations; and a ticket to a "Citizen's Reception to his Excellency
    President Johnson." <br><br>A more detailed inventory of this national
    significant archive is available upon request. Provenance: from the
    collection of Thomas Welles Brainard, great-great-grandson of Gideon Welles.

    The Washington Evening Star of 9 February 1865 describes this White House
    event, which went from about 7 to 10 in the evening: "The dinner, which was
    a magnificent one, was furnished by a celebrated French cook, and the Marine
    Band enlivened the occasion with excellent music." The published guest list
    did not include the recipient of this invitation, Mary Jane Hales Welles,
    who was a close friend of Mary Todd Lincoln and doubtless attended other
    dinners at the White House--but she was apparently forced to turn down this
    invitation with regret. The newspaper reported that the same evening,
    "Secretary Welles . . . gave his second evening reception. . . . The
    spacious parlours were thronged at an early hour." Both Admiral Farragut and
    Postmaster General William Dennison managed to attend both dinners, probably
    sneaking out awkwardly from the Welles event before its conclusion.

  at-a-glance: '[Washington], 19 April 1865'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Attendance at Lincoln's White House funeral service was limited due to space
    considerations. The Washington Evening Star described it as "the most solemn
    day in the history of Washington" and detailed the arrangements:
    <br><br>"During the forenoon various bodies had met at the Treasury
    Department, separate rooms having been assigned to them, and to these
    Assistant Secretary Harrington, who had charge of the arrangements,
    delivered tickets of admission to the Executive Mansion. They included the
    Assistant Secretaries . . . Senators and Representatives in Congress,
    Governors of the several states, the Judiciary, and others of prominence.
    None could enter the mansion without tickets, room having been provided for
    600 persons only up on the raised platform steps on the east, north, and
    south side of the room. The corpse lay about the center, space being
    reserved all around the catafalque, with chairs for the occupation of the
    family of the deceased. At eleven o'clock the invited personages began to
    arrive. . . . At noon the President of the United States entered in company
    with his Cabinet. . . . Behind Mr. Hamlin were Chief Justice Chase, and
    Secretaries Welles, Dennison, Speed, and Usher." Immediately after the
    services, the coffin was taken on a funeral procession down Pennsylvania
    Avenue. <br><br>Provenance: from the collection of Thomas Welles Brainard,

    This engraving was done after an original 1864 White House life study by
    Francis Bicknell Carpenter (1830-1900). Mary Lincoln endorsed it as "the
    most perfect likeness of my beloved husband that I have ever seen," adding
    poignantly "The resemblance is so accurate in Mr. Halpin's engraving that it
    will require far more calmness than I can now command to have it placed

  CROSSHEAD: Cane said to be made for Abraham Lincoln from the wood of Fort Sumter.
  TYPESET: >-
    Elaborately carved wooden cane, 35½ inches in length including modern
    imitation ivory knob added to replace the damaged original.
  at-a-glance: 'No place, circa 1865?'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This cane is reputed by family history to have been made from wood taken
    from Fort Sumter for President Abraham Lincoln, and then presented after his
    death to his Secretary of the Navy and personal friend, Gideon Welles. The
    cane bears no inscriptions and the story is probably impossible to prove,
    but we have not managed to disprove it, either. <br><br>The Union Army
    regained possession of Fort Sumter on 22 February 1865, which would allow
    for less than two months for a cane to be made and presented to Lincoln
    before his death. In at least three letters to her close friend Mary Jane
    Hale Welles from July through December 1865, Mary Todd Lincoln stated her
    intentions to give Gideon Welles a cane from Lincoln's collection: "I intend
    sending Mr Welles one of the best canes, and it is quite embarrassing that I
    have so long delayed doing this." (see "Mary Todd Lincoln: Her Life and
    Letters," pages 257, 277, 317). The cane was photographed in a 1975 article
    on the consignor's family papers, with the note "Brainard also owns a cane,
    which Lincoln, who owned many of them, gave to Welles. It is reputed carved
    from wood taken from Fort Sumter" ("Gideon Welles had an Eye for History,"
    in Hartford Sunday Times Magazine, 30 March 1975). Provenance: from the

    during her years in the White House, now held at the Smithsonian. They note
    that "it is likely the service was presented to the first lady as a gift
    from the citizens of New York." <br><br>These pieces have descended in the
    family of Gideon Welles, Lincoln's Secretary of the Navy. Mrs. Mary Jane
    Welles (1817-1886) was one of Mary Todd Lincoln's closest friends in
    Washington. According to family tradition, these pieces were ordered in

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    These letters were written to Jeffrey Sage (1791-1876) and his son William
    N. Sage (born 1828) of Broome County, NY and Virginia, who had invested in
    land in Nemaha County in northeastern Kansas, apparently in the now-defunct
    village of Albany just north of Sabetha. These letters from their agents and
    friends in Kansas offer some interesting details on frontier conditions
    there during the Civil War era. John L. Graham writes on 6 January 1861:
    "Miller is out on the Republican Fork of the Kansas River, hunting and
    trapping. . . . There are three houses in Albany and a steam sawmill in
    prospect, no school house and no school, no store. There are nine houses in
    Sabetha, no school house, but they have a school in the log house on the
    corner and have 30 schollars. There is a good blacksmith there, and he has a
    pleanty of work. He has two marriageable daughters and Bill Graham waited on
    one of them to meeting down to Albany yesterday." Edwin Miller wrote from
    Missouri on 19 August 1865: "I have not lived in Kan. since the war
    commenced. I was in the service 2 yrs, was lieut. in the Kans. 7th Cavalry.
    . . . Albany has got the P.O. away from Sabatha since I left. There is no
    store in Sabetha, 2 in Albany." He lists the residents of Albany. J.C.
    Hebbard, a resident of Seneca since 1860, sent his report on 14 February
    1866, describing the businesses in Seneca and Albany, and anticipating
    "quite a large emigration to Kansas this year." Hebbard's gilt-accented
    letterhead from 1868 has a long promotional message regarding Nemaha County
    printed on verso, and his 15 August 1868 letter boasts of Albany's "two
    stores and a very fine school building." <br><br>Also included is a
    "Township Map of Nemaha County" by J.W. Tuller, which shows a proposed
    railroad (completed in 1866), settlements, school buildings, saw and grist
    mills, and the famed Overland Trail (here marked as "Great Overland Route to
    California"). A small square just north of Albany is marked in red ink,
    likely the land owned by the Sage family. We trace no other examples of this

    Henry John Pierce (1833-1883) was raised in Saybrook, OH and went west as a

    American Indians. <br><br>On 9 October 1864 he wrote to his sister Susan
    Elizabeth Pierce (1847-1932) that he "was intending to go on the Plains
    again the first of this month, but the Indians have made it rather of a
    hazardous undertaking, danger of loseing my scalp lock. This country
    witnessed one of the largest stampedes on record, Bull Run excepted.
    Everyone in this vicinity and west for 30 miles flocked into Beatrice,
    bringing their stock and such other plunder as they could hastily gather
    together. . . . A horseman came in post hast saying that the Indians were
    within 10 miles of us, killing and burning everything. . . . The most
    resolute stuck to the town. We made a barricade of wagons and got inside of
    the circle and waited, but no Indians came to us.. . . . 7 or 8 of my
    friends have been killed and their widows left to the charity of a cold
    world." <br><br>Pierce describes further Indian trouble on 15 January 1865:
    "Since New Years they have taken possession of the country west of us again,
    captured several coaches, attacked the town of Julesburg and other points.
    They took one coach and eleven passengers, 75,000 dollars in specie. Another
    coach on the overland mail was lost, one of the lead horses came in to the
    station with the harness on, all that escaped of that one."

    Edmund Gibson Ross (1826-1907) served as territorial governor of New Mexico
    from 1885 to 1889. He had earlier gained fame as a Senator from Kansas, when
    as a Republican he broke from his party and cast the deciding vote against
    convicting President Andrew Johnson in the 1868 impeachment trial. For this,
    Ross would be featured in John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage. As New
    Mexico governor, Ross was a reformer who advocated for public schools, a
    university, and an asylum. He was usually on the losing end in a perpetual
    battle with the territorial legislature and its "Santa Fe Ring." Most of the
    legislation passed in his final year was accomplished either without his
    approval, or over his veto. See Howard R. Lamar, "Edmund G. Ross as Governor
    of New Mexico Territory: A Reappraisal," New Mexico Historical Review 36:3
    (July 1961). <br><br>Offered here are 16 of his "Special Messages" to the
    28th Legislative Assembly issued over a two-month period toward the end of
    his term. In them, he advocates futilely for his chosen causes, and explains

    the Gulf of Mexico; "An act to prevent the overstocking of cattle ranges";
    an act "prohibiting alien investments in real estates in the territories"
    (decades before the Roswell Incident); irrigation; and much more.

    Lorenzo de Zavala (1788-1836) was a prominent liberal Mexican politician; he
    had helped draft the Constitution of 1824, and served as president of
    Congress, and Secretary of Finance. In 1829 he began investing in Texan
    lands, which began his close involvement in Texas. <br><br>When this
    document was issued, Zavala was serving as Governor of the State of Mexico.
    In this open letter to Mexican president Santa Anna dated 1 June 1833 in
    Tlalpan, General Gabriel Durán makes a vehement attack on Zavala's
    patriotism and character, urging Santa Anna to cut ties with Zavala
    completely. Translated, in part: "An audacious and insolent faction . . .
    took by assault the sovereign executive powers enabling Lorenzo Zavala, a
    famous criminal, despised in general by the nation." In order to "sustain
    the sovereignty of the nation in spite of the violent jolt and ill-fated
    attacks of the anarchy," Duran offers Santa Anna the military support needed
    to halt "a schism and the violation of our sacred religion, and the
    restlessness of proprietors of being despoiled of their properties will be
    forever dissipated.” He offers an 8-point plan to "annul the elections where
    de Zavala was triumphant." <br><br>Durán's message was not at first heeded
    by Santa Anna, who appointed Zavala as Minister to France in October 1833.
    However, in reaction to Santa Anna's dictatorial actions, Zavala resigned
    his position in 1834, never returned to Mexico, and settled in Texas in 1835
    when it was on the cusp of revolution. He helped draft the Texan
    constitution, and served as the Republic's first vice president.

    the peace, was in conflict with a 31 March federal decree. He concludes (in
    translation) that the government "cannot allow partial measures to subsist

    minor worming, light folds.
  at-a-glance: '[Mexico], circa April 1836'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    A compilation of 15 key documents relating to the Texas Revolution in March
    and early April 1836, covering both the Goliad campaign and the siege of the
    Alamo, some of them as reported in an issue of the "Diario del Gobierno de
    la Republica Mexicana." <br><br>They include the 20 March instrument of
    surrender by General James Fannin at Goliad (pages 5-6), and the internal
    debate between President Santa Anna and General Urrea over the fate of the
    prisoners which culminated in the Goliad Massacre. Also included is a
    Spanish translation of the last appeal for assistance by Alamo commander
    William Travis, dated 3 March 1836, which concludes "Victoria ó muerte!!"
    (Victory or Death). We can find no other example of this Spanish translation
    in print. <br><br>4 documents are signed in type by Santa Anna, dated 18
    March, 26 March, 27 March, and 28 March. In this last letter, which we have
    not found published elsewhere, he expresses outrage to General Urrea about
    the arrogance and defiance of Travis: "En el sitado periódico y parte dicho
    del comandante Travis, se nota tambien la arrogancia y desprecio con que
    estos foragidos insultaban el acreditado valor del ejército mexicano ; y si
    bien pelearon hasta la desesperacion, tambien se ha dado á sus compañeros
    una terrible leccion de la suerte que les está reservada á los que como
    ellos atenten á la integridad de la repúblico, provocando su justa
    venganza." Translated: "In the newspaper statement by Commander Travis, the
    arrogance and contempt with which these outlaws insulted the courage of the
    Mexican army is also noted; and although they fought to the point of
    desperation, their companions have also been given a terrible lesson in the
    fate that is reserved for those who, like them, violate the integrity of the
    republic, provoking their just revenge."<br><br>5 other letters are signed
    in type by José de Urrea, commander of the Goliad Campaign. 2 are by the
    Mexican Secretary of War José María de Tornel, and a 20 March letter by
    Colonel Francisco de Garay describes the Mexican victory at Goliad. The
    final document repeats a report on the Mexican attack on San Felipe de
    Austin, which had been published in the 28 April 1836 issue of another
    Mexican newspaper, "La Lima del Vulcano." <br><br>We trace no other examples
    of this important pamphlet--not in OCLC, Palau, Streeter's Texas, or via
    Google.

    John Hunt McIlvain (1808-1885) came from a prominent Philadelphia family of
    lumber merchants, and became a noted ornithologist. This letter was written
    on his 1853 trip to the Rocky Mountains. <br><br>He writes from Fort
    Laramie, which had been established in 1849 on the site of an older trading
    post. "I had walked a short distance down the Laramie [River], & seeing the
    mail coming, hurried home with trembling anxiety. All the officers &
    souldiers were assembled in the office & I saw each receiving their letters,
    some ½ dozen, and quietly awaited my turn without speaking a word; but when
    informed 'Mr. Mc, there is nothing for you' I felt my heart sinck within me,
    & my discomforture was noted by every body. What shall I say? My forebodings
    are dreadfull. Is my wife or my precious children gone? I have now been here
    between 4 & 5 weeks since which this very mail & the same driver have been
    to Independence on the frontier & returned. Not one word since the day I
    left the boundary. . . . I will endeavor to bear my disappointment with
    philosophy." A bit of good news: McIlvain's wife and children all survived
    long past 1853. McIlvain also receives postal advice from one of the post's
    officers, Hugh B. Fleming: "Mr. F. has just learned of his promotion, & he
    is worthy of it if any military man is, he is quite young & also the
    quartermaster here."

    Herbert Englebert Teschemacher (1856-1907) and Frederick Ogden deBilliers
    (1857-1935) were Harvard classmates (class of 1878). Much like Theodore
    Roosevelt (Class of 1880), they went west together to seek their fortunes in
    cattle; Roosevelt became one of their stockholders. Teschemacher and
    deBilliers were both among the leaders of the raiders who did battle against
    rustlers and smaller ranchers in the famous 1892 Johnson County Range War,
    and were both arrested for their roles. While in confinement deBilliers
    became violently insane and was sent east to New York for recovery (see San
    Francisco Chronicle, 8 July 1892, Chicago Inter-Ocean, 6 January 1893).
    Offered here are: <br><br>Financial statement for the Teschemacher &
    deBillier Cattle Co. 6 printed pages. 8vo, original wrappers, dampstained

    <br><br>Manuscript document headed "Mr. F.O. deBillier, one of our oldest
    and most popular members, is about to sever his connection with this Club.
    We, the undersigned, hereby express our desire to unite in giving him a

    8 inches; partial separation at fold. No place, 25 October 1890. The club is
    not named, but many or most of the signers appear to be prominent Wyoming
    businessmen, including deBilliers' business partner H.E. Teschemacher, and
    former Cheyenne mayor M.V. Boughton--best known as the founding president of
    the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, which represented the larger
    cattlemen. Prominent Wyoming businessman John Clay, whose name appears here,
    was also named as a supporter of the raiders. We suspect the event may have
    been held by the Cheyenne Club, Wyoming's leading social club.

  at-a-glance: 'Various places, 1852-1855'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    These letters offer an entertaining mix of whaling stories and South Pacific
    ethnographic detail, and they reach a poignant conclusion. Philip Mixsell
    Kinsey (1829-1855) was raised in Catasauqua, PA near Allentown, and set out
    on a whaling voyage aboard the ship Amazon of Fairhaven, MA in September
    1852. <br><br>His 8 November 1853 letter describes whaling in the Arctic,
    including an attempt to strip the blubber and tusks from a dead walrus,
    running through an ice field which other whalers had refused to attempt. One
    of many rousing whaling passages: "When he rose to the top of the water, he
    recived two iron from our boat, and now the fun commences. . . . Now he's
    off at rail road speed and towing the two boats. . . . You can hardly see
    for the white water, but there he slacks. Hall line quick my boys, there he
    slows, spring to your ores and lay back, let her run steady, and now the
    mate is lancin' him stern all quick, the Capt. is lancin' on the other side.
    There he goes down. . . . The next time he rose, the mate gave him a death
    lance for sure. He spouts thick blood, and three hearty cheers arises from
    the boats and ship. . . . The head with bone weighed about 3000 lbs--rather
    a large head, don't you think?" On 25 March 1855 he contemplates a gift for
    his brother: "About that mermaid I am afraid I shall be unable to catch one,
    but what do you think about a bottle of wind caught from the last gale, or a
    piece of blackskin scraped from the flukes of a whale?"<br><br>On 24 March
    1853 he describes the Portuguese Atlantic colony of Cape Verde: "These
    islands are inhabited by Portiguise. Thay look like our plantation Negrows.
    I understand that the missionarys have made an excellant harvest in
    converting souls to God." On 12 April [1853] he describes at length the
    island of "Whylootake one of the Friendlys" (in Tonga, or perhaps Aitutaki
    in the Cook Islands): extensive fruit groves, and an exceptionally honest
    and intelligent population. He also recounts three sailors who deserted the
    ship in New Zealand, but ran out of food after eight days: "Hunger compelled
    them to leave their hiding place to seek some food, but no sooner did they
    show their heads, than the Mowarys [Maoris] nab them and conducted them to
    the calabuse . . . for a reward of 5 lb. They will burn all the wood on the
    land if they could not find the runaway outside the bush." Archangel Bay in
    Siberia is discussed on 8 November 1853. <br><br>Maui did not meet with
    Kinsey's approval. He describes the restrictive shore leave laws at length,
    and complains: "The dust in the streets in generly from 8 to 10 inches
    thick. . . . Their dress is made in the oddest style that I can remember,
    the waist being right under the arms and hanging loose upon the body. Their
    head dress is generly artificial flowers brought from China." In March 1855
    he describes alleged cannibalism on the Marquesas Islands: "At times the
    chiefs will fight their king, or it will be chief against chief. When an
    enemy kills annother, if he can get the body he secures it untill he
    collects his friends, when he takes certain parts of the body and roasts it
    for them." He also describes their appearance: "Each tribe can be told by
    their tatooing. This tattoing is all done for the girls. If a man is not
    pricked up in this way, no girl will marry him. The women have the tattooing
    done upon the arms and legs and some upon the lips." <br><br>Philip's last
    letter was written from Lahaina, Hawaii on 15 October 1855. He describes
    landing a whale in a storm "blowing so hard that it caused the ship to jump
    up and down so bad that the fluke chain parted, and so to save our main mast
    we had to cut the whale adrift, and to tell the truth it was with sad hearts
    that we did so." He describes the celebration on the ship as their cruise
    came to an end, bound for the Hawaiian Islands. A month later came a
    mournful letter from the ship's master Edward H. Barber announcing Philip's
    death while "attempting to recover one of the ship's boats whilst on shore
    at Hervey's Island after recruits for my homeward passage. . . . He must
    have been carried out with the undertow. . . . His body was not recovered."

    when war broke out, he was working in a fish cannery in Blaine, WA, on the
    Canadian border. This letter discusses his Christmas-time homesickness, his
    hunt for souvenirs, and his old base at Camp Lewis, WA. He notes "I have
    explored all the country around this place within walking distance . . . we
    are now part of the battle line, so there is not quite so much to see." He
    closes with some humorous thoughts on the head of the United States Food

    on his conservation notions yet? If he has not, he is going to have trouble
    with this bunch when they get back. The whole outfit has planned a campaign
    against pies, cakes, and all the other sweet stuff. With our present
    strength, we believe that we can win out in a short time. When we strike, we
    will all hit that line at once, and I know that victory must be ours."

  FOOTNOTE: ' Florence Lucile Hodgson (1892-1968) attended the University of Michigan, and then in 1929 began teaching Latin at the Punahou Academy, an elite Honolulu preparatory school. She wrote this haunting manuscript memoir of Pearl Harbor, "written this 463rd night of black-out, March 15, 1943." It begins with a description of a routine pleasant Sunday morning disturbed by a distant sound of "almost continuous firing of guns . . . interspersed with very disturbing louder crashes." She assumed it was simply a military exercise, but thought with annoyance "If war ever should come, it would probably sound like this." The radio began making cryptic pronouncements urging residents to stay indoors and avoid the telephone, adding "This is the real McCoy" and eventually "The Islands are being attacked." She climbed a nearby hill where other residents had gathered, and saw smoke screening Pearl Harbor, burning homes scattered through the city, and military convoys moving into her school''s campus below: "Little did we think as we watched them that the U.S.E.D was taking possession of our school and seventy-acre campus for the duration of the war." <br><br>The small crowd on the hill spotted seven Japanese planes circling the harbor just out of reach of the anti-aircraft guns, and fled rapidly when the planes veered off and headed directly toward the hill: "A few like me just stood, hoping that if they strafed us with machine guns, that it would be over for us quickly." A neighbor carrying a long rifle urged them to disperse, as the crowd was an easy target. <br><br>Actual news mixed with wild rumors filtered in through the afternoon ("Jap parachutists are dropping everywhere on St. Louis Heights"). The radio urged civilians to donate blood. The governor declared martial law "in a shaking voice" as "a bomb that morning had fallen in front of his residence." She learned that a friend who had been out for a drive that morning near the base was evacuated by military truck and spent the night sheltered at Diamond Head Crater. The account closes with the author sitting on her terrace that evening in near-total darkness, "firmly convinced that the dastardly sneak attack on the fleet at Pearl Harbor . . . had been but a prelude to the landing of Jap troops. . . . I wondered how ready were we to meet the invasion." '

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    When these diaries began, our diarist was a fireman third class. He had just
    transferred to the USS Gillis, an aircraft tender and rescue patrol ship
    heading north from Seattle to Alaska's Aleutian Islands, when had been
    recently liberated from the Japanese. This was not the typical naval
    service. The Gillis was tasked with transporting a boatload of military dogs
    on 20 November 1943, which caused considerable chaos on board: "40 Airdales
    came aboard today. We are to take them to Attu." He recorded a mighty storm
    on the unusual date of 30 February 1944 near Attu ("the westernmost point in
    the world"): "Had a big one hit us, liked to of taken the stack off, put two
    holes in it, tore off one gun, knock the guard rail out of line, tore up the
    flare locker." <br><br>The Gillis went in for overhaul in the spring of
    1944, and Elliott started a new diary volume on 10 June 1944 as the ship
    began a new cruise in the South Pacific. Here the ship, accompanying
    aircraft carriers, was under constant threat from "tin fish" (torpedoes) and
    kamikaze planes. On 20 August 1944, "had a fire last night on the main
    discustion panel, burn hell out of everything. Sure was a mess. We--Scratch,
    Ford & I--had to rig up portable lights all over the ship." On 7 December
    1944, "radar shack . . . had picked up a ship which was headed in our
    direction. . . . It didn't pass us. Instead it ramed us just aft of our No.
    1 gun, nearly cutting us in two. We put the collision mat over, but it
    didn't do any good. . . . One officer got hurt bad." On 11 March, "during
    movie Jap planes (3) came over. One crashed into the ACV, doing some damage
    to her aft end. Kill one, wounded 25 others, other planes crashed and
    missed." In the fleet to capture the Kerama Islands on 27 March 1945, "was
    attacked this morning by 4 dive bombers and one light bomber. . . . We were
    about 1 mile off the beach, acting as a screen and also to draw fire from
    the shore batteries." At the start of the long Battle of Okinawa, 1 April
    1945, "Easter Sunday to the folk home, but to us Invasion Day. Went in about
    0300 first wave. By noon today we had taken two airstrips." 7 April: "On the
    number of Jap planes, it was 186 that came over. We got 118 of them. They
    hit 28 ships, sunk 4, still our losses are slight." 14 April: "Seem to be
    fighting the Japs up in the hills. Several fires were started." 29 April:
    "The raid last night was of 200 planes, most of them were Jap human robot
    bombs." <br><br>Inserted in one diary are a few mementos: an insignia
    (belonging to an electrician, not our fireman diarist); two slips with the
    names of sailors; a Real Photo postcard of an unidentified sweetheart; and a
    group portrait of about 20 smiling sailors. <br><br>We attribute the
    authorship to Harold McGee Elliott (1923-2019), who was born in Richmond, VA
    and enlisted in the Navy from Washington in October 1942. Elliott is not
    named in these diaries, but is recorded as one of 4 firemen assigned to the
    Gillis on 8 November 1943, and his promotion to fireman first class is
    recorded in both the diary and muster rolls on 2 February 1944; he notes his
    22nd birthday on 2 February 1945. The man standing farthest to the right in
    the group photograph bears some resemblance to Elliott's obituary
    photograph, though they are separated by more than 70 years.

    painted 15 days after the American victory over the Japanese in the Battle
    of Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands. It apparently shows a tank crew's
    sleeping quarters on the occupied atoll: a tent pitched off the rear of a
    tank, fortified by logs and sandbags. Corporal Fulgo was killed in action
    four months later at the Battle of Saipan.

    Benjamin Clement (1785-1835) was a captain in the Royal Navy (and an
    acquaintance of Jane Austen). In 1830, he was the captain of renowned HMS
    Shannon. These papers relate to his offer to help revolutionary hero Simón
    Bolívar seek exile in Jamaica, to the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830,
    and to Bolívar's sword and cloak which remained in the captain's possession.
    <br><br>"Memoranda for Capt. Clement," unsigned but apparently by Bolívar's
    aide-de-camp Colonel Belford Wilson. 7 [of 11?] pages, moderate wear
    including some loss from vermin, apparently missing a second sheet. "By an
    extraordinary courier that reached Bogotá a few hours previous . . .
    information was received of the south of Colombia having separated from the
    rest of the Republick . . . in consequence of the resolution of G'l Bolivar
    to resign the supreme command and leave the country altogether being made
    known. G'l Bolivar was the connecting link that had hitherto preserved the
    union." He describes military actions in the cities of Pasto and Cali, where
    "three hundred citizens armed themselves and refused to deliver up to G'l
    Obando the ammunition & stores they had in their city." General José María
    Obando, new governor of Socorro, is denounced for his role "in a plot to
    destroy the late Congress." The outlying departments of Colombia are now
    "prey to anarchy, divided among themselves & from the rest of the
    republick." As for Bolívar, his "intention is to sail for England so soon as
    his passport arrives from Bogotá," otherwise he "would have availed himself
    of Capt. Clement's kind offer for passage to Jamaica on board the HMS
    Shannon. He was most anxious to have done so." 28 May and 9 June 1830.
    <br><br>Partial letter to Capt. Clement, in the same hand, also apparently
    Colonel Belford Wilson. 4 pages but lacking the final pages and signature;
    partial separations at folds. "The untimely death of my late illustrious
    benefactor and your friend, the Liberator of Colombia, must have been deeply
    regretted by you. . . . I was greatly grieved to hear that you had
    unfortunately lost the military cloak presented to you by H.E. [His
    Excellency?] together with his sword, the last he ever used in defense of
    his country, of liberty, & of humanity." He also discusses "G'l Bolivar's
    letter to me" which "gives his motives for not profitting by your kind offer
    to convey him to Jamaica. Would to God he had done so. . . . I assure you,
    the Shannon was for a long time our hope, but fate prevented his return."
    The author discusses his recent convalescence in Jamaica under the care of
    Commodore Farquhar, which was widely reported in newspapers such as the
    Caledonian Mercury of 26 February 1831 (naming him as Belford Wilson).
    Kingston, Jamaica, 4 March 1831. <br><br>Letter from Capt. Clement's younger

    This American military intelligence report was based on ten months of study
    in La Paz and a journey across the nation's central plain. The compiler was
    Lieutenant Constant Cordier (1878-1940) of the 4th United States Infantry, a
    Louisiana native who later reached the rank of colonel. His preface asserts
    his confidence that "it combines the most accurate and up-to-date
    information extant, under any one cover, on Bolivia." The illustrations are
    generally excised or reproduced from other publications, but some
    photographs appear to be original. The report covers geography, natural
    history, economy, and of course the Bolivian military (pages 483-527). His
    assessment of the Bolivian troops: "They appeared to march not only well,
    but better than the Peruvians. . . . He will march for days with a load upon
    his back, which any white man would grumble at, without the slightest
    murmur. With his coca, and very little more in the way of nourishment, he
    will outwalk any white foreign soldier" (pages 521-522). The report has a
    detailed bibliography and table of contents, and is well-indexed.
    <br><br>Lieutenant Cordier compiled this report while serving as an American
    military attaché in Lima for the Office of the Chief of Staff's Second
    Section, which supervised military intelligence operations. It was filed in
    the library of the Second Section with a "Confidential" stamp, but the
    Second Section soon abandoned its intelligence duties, which probably
    explains the "withdrawn from library" stamp on the title page. The rear
    flyleaf bears a pencil notation, "Bought City 1/18/47"; City Book Auction of
    New York held an auction that day. The report appears to be unpublished. No
    other examples are known; his similar report on Brazil in 4 volumes is held
    by the New York Public Library.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    "The rebels' party murdered every white person that came in their way."
    <br><br>The 1835 Cabanagem revolt in the northern Brazilian province of Pará
    attempted to establish independence from Brazil and Portugal; an estimated
    40,000 combatants and civilians lost their lives. The Rear Admiral Graham
    Eden Hamond (1779-1862) was then commander of the Royal Navy's South
    American Station, and the best hope for the protection of British citizens
    caught up in the revolt. Offered here are: <br><br>4 letters from consul
    Edward Watts in Pernambuco. Watts reports on political conditions in the
    province, noting on 7 March "an unceasing oscillation for supremacy which
    disturbs publick tranquility and very materially deranges the operations of
    British and other foreign trade at this port" and praising the "moral effect
    produced by the occasional appearance of a British pennant at this port." A
    week later he discusses the Cabanagem revolt, a "bloody tragedy" in which
    "the insurgents assassinated the president of that province. . . . Several
    others have fallen victims to the savage fury of the populace and soldiers,"
    stirring up separatists in Pernambuco. He encloses a plea signed by 12
    British merchants in Pernambuco: "Apprehensive as we are that a violent
    explosion may soon take place in Pernambuco" they plead for "the urgent
    necessity of the immediate appearance of a British vessel of war."
    <br><br>Two contemporary copies of reports from the province of Maranhão are
    dated 31 August and 10 September 1835, describing "the dreadful account of
    the attack of the city and the capture of the greatest part of it by the
    rebels . . . chiefly or altogether people of colour. . . . Most or all of
    the English houses in Pará have been plundered. That of Mssrs. Campbell &
    Co. was defended for thirty-six hours by the sailors of H.M. Sloop
    racehorse, but after several of these sailors were killed it was abandoned
    to the rebels and plundered of everything. . . . It appears the rebels'
    party murdered every white person that came in their way." <br><br>Finally,
    Admiralty official Sir John Barrow (best known as a patron of polar
    exploration) wrote to Hamond on 18 January 1836, on learning "the ports of
    the revolted province of Para to be in a state of blockade, I am commanded
    by their Lordships to acquaint you that they approve of what you have done."
    Two copies of this official message are present here, both signed by
    Barrow.

    And now for something completely different. Connecticut native Leroy Marcus
    Glodell (1902-1984) traveled widely before the World War Two, including a
    tour of Mexico in the 1920s as a dancer. He became known as an artisanal
    castanet maker. In 1938 he settled in East Providence, RI where he worked as
    an electrician. By March 1941, before Pearl Harbor, he was already in army
    service in Florida. He became a captain, stationed mostly stateside in
    Washington, Miami, Leavenworth, KS, and elsewhere. After the war, given his
    fluency in Spanish, he remained in the army as an attaché in South America,
    and as chief of intelligence in the Panama Canal Zone, reaching the rank of
    colonel. <br><br>About half of this collection consists of a long
    correspondence between Glodell and his sweetheart Florence Grace Knapton
    Consolves (1910-1997) of Providence, RI. This collection includes several
    hundred letters between the two, mostly from 1941 through their marriage in
    1947 in Cochabamba, Bolivia. <br><br>Several binders of photographs and
    reports relate to Glodell's military work in Latin America, and to his
    interest in local history there: an analysis of Fort Lorenzo de Chagres in
    Panama; photos of the Escuela de Transmisiones in Bolivia; several scrapbook
    pages of Glodell's expedition down Bolivia's Espirito Santo River; a
    typescript 1925 Department of State analysis of Mexican-American relations,
    1910-1920; and much more. Hundreds of photographs document his military,
    personal, and musical lives. <br><br>Also included are correspondence and
    printed matter regarding flamenco dancing and his side business as a
    castanet manufacturer through 1977. His obituary in the January 1984 issue
    of Jaleo, a flamenco newsletter, described him as "one of the finest
    castanet makers in the world . . . one of the great masters of his craft."

    Santa Anna was living in exile in Cuba. After the Mexicans were defeated at

    Paredes was a conservative general who had assumed the presidency by coup
    shortly before the Mexican-American War, resigned in July 1846, and went
    briefly into exile. Here, three months after Mexico's formal surrender by
    the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, he attempts to rally support for continued
    resistance to the punitive terms, asserting (in translation) that the treaty
    "makes a vain illusion of the independence that our forebears conquered with
    their blood. This situation is too humiliating and violent to be tolerated
    by the Mexicans who are accustomed to the pleasures of liberty and complete
    independence from foreign nations. Our nation will not accept this offense
    for very long." In a separate document not offered here, a group of army
    officers in Guanajuato led by Nicolás Flores endorsed this plan two days
    later. <br><br>None traced at auction, in Palau, or in OCLC. The text

    These papers all relate to the estate of a family with mining interests in
    Aguascaliente and Bolaños. The principals are Augustina Velázquez, who died
    in 1780; her husband Antonio Vivanco y Gutierrez (1727-1799), a wealthy mine
    owner who was made Marqués de Vivanco in 1791 for his service in the Bolaños
    militia; and their son Antonio Guadalupe Vivanco de Velásquez (1778-1800),
    the second Marques, who died young, leaving a widow, an infant daughter and
    a complex estate situation. This packet includes: <br><br>[121] manuscript
    leaves, including dozens of receipts of various sizes, bound together.
    Various places, 1780-1782. Augustina Velázquez's will ordered that numerous
    masses were read in her name in her home region, with priests signing
    receipts for the payments. One intriguing entry is a receipt for donations
    signed by 20 priests, including "Br. Hidalgo"--an early signature of Miguel
    Hidalgo (1753-1811). He had been ordained as a priest in 1773, and much
    later was a leader in the Mexican war of independence. During this period he
    was at the Colegio de San Nicolás Obispo in what is now Morelia. The initial
    "H" evolved in his later signatures, but the remainder is a close match.

    Charlotte Ordway Biggs (1807-1889) grew up in Maine and married a textile
    mechanic. In 1833, he was hired to go to Mexico City to set up and operate a
    boatload of cotton machinery. This very long letter, written to a long-lost
    childhood friend, is basically an autobiography of hardship and tragedy.
    <br><br>She describes arrival in Veracruz during a plague: "They kept us
    several days in quarantine nearly roasting us alive and then suffered us to
    go ashore into the midst of the black vomit. <br><br>Political upheaval:
    "Santa Anna had just come to power. Every city in the union was in a state
    of revolt. Mexico was filled with his troops, all the principal streets
    barocaded and canon planted in every direction." <br><br>Unemployment: "The
    company that brought us out had become bankrupt and we could not get a
    dollar from them . . . surrounded by a strange race of people, could not
    speak their language nor make ourselves understood, and destitute of the
    means of support." They stayed for a year in the American consul's hacienda,
    living on his charity. <br><br>Next came embezzlement by a business partner,
    after the cotton machinery was finally put to use, when they "took in a
    third partner who proved a perfect swindler. He cheated them out of nearly
    all they had made." <br><br>Then her husband's illness after running a
    cotton gin on Mexico's Pacific Coast: "He took very sick with the coast
    fever which came near ending his career. When he left home he weighed 160
    lbs and when he returned he weighed but 96."<br><br>The Biggs family by now
    included 8 children, and they sought "the bennifit of an English education
    which we could not do thare amogst a set of Catholicks whare no other
    religion is tolerated." After saving $6,000 in ten years, they returned to
    America, hoping to buy a farm. However, her husband became distracted on
    their journey by the offer of an old grist mill in Illinois, on which he
    spent all their savings. The mill soon washed out in a freshet, and after it
    was rebuilt, their eldest son was killed in the mill machinery. Mr. Biggs
    was so distraught that he died just 4 weeks later, leaving Charlotte with no
    income and 7 children to raise. She eked out a meager existence running a
    boarding house in Oquawka, IL, with other deaths and hardships along the
    way. She concludes: "When I was born, my destiny was marked out. I was poor
    then, and shall remain so to the end of the chapter."

    The Peruvian Central Railway was an ambitious mountainous line which began
    construction in 1870 and was not completed until 1908. It remains in
    operation, and has been submitted as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its
    engineering marvels and its evocation of Peru's arrival in the industrial
    era. <br><br>Charles J. MacConnell (1837-1909) was a Pennsylvanian who
    graduated from the New Jersey State Normal School (now the College of New
    Jersey), enlisted in the Navy during the Civil War, and remained in the
    service afterward. At the time he wrote most of these letters, he was First
    Assistant Engineer aboard the USS Pensacola in the Pacific Squadron. He
    wrote four of these letters off the coast of Peru, or in the coastal city of
    Callao. The first of his letters, dated 20 April 1873, describes a visit to
    the tomb of Pizarro, where one of his ugly American colleagues offers to buy
    Pizarro's skull and attempts to purloin a toe bone. He is then invited to
    join a party of officers on the new railroad up to the mining center in La
    Oroya, but misses the train. He soon learns by telegraph that the train had
    derailed: "One had broken his leg, another was paralyzed, and another had
    his head split open, another his back broken, the conductor was so much
    injured that he would probably die." McConnell then took the next train up
    to San Bartolomé to help retrieve his wounded comrades. He sat in the
    locomotive for a better view, and found the railroad a marvel: "the road
    commences to climb as soon as you leave the depot . . . it looks like the
    roof of a house in some places." In San Bartolomé he helped load the wounded
    naval men into the car for the return trip, then stayed on the
    mountain-bound train to explore to the end of the road: "The roads were laid
    to Surco at an elevation of over 7000 feet, considerably higher than Mount
    Washington, and yet the mountains loomed up for 2000 to 2000 feet higher
    above our heads and the snow glistened in the sun." He gave the measurements
    of the famed bridge over the Rio Verrugas, adding that "it is the most
    magnificent structure of the kind I ever saw. . . rocks weighing sometimes
    20 tons start down the mountain side when the steam whistles sound and are
    mighty likely to smash things. . . . These mountain sides are all terraced
    for gardens and vineyards by the ancient Peruvians hundreds of years ago,
    but now in ruins." McConnell's 24 April letter continues the story with an
    account of the ongoing rail construction at Surco: "They are digging,
    tunneling, and blasting beyond us, but no rails are laid yet. From this
    point, all the supplies etc. have to be transported on the backs of mules to
    the elevations under 10,000 feet. Above that they employ llamas, a beast
    peculiar to these regions. . . . They always have a leader who is as proud
    as a peacock with holes bored in the tips of his ears, in which are placed
    knots of brightly colored ribbons. . . . No other animals can live up here."
    <br><br>MacConnell's 8 July 1873 letter describes a grand ball at the Lima
    home of railroad magnate Henry Meiggs, and on 14 March 1874 he describes
    another trip up the Peruvian Central Railway, which extended 15 miles
    further past San Bartolomé than during his first visit. "I climbed up the
    side of a mountain on horseback and went in Tunnel No. 15 to see them at
    work. They had run the heading in some 750 feet in the hardest rock I ever
    saw, and were drilling away using a diamond drill worked with compressed
    air. . . . The grade is such that it would utterly demoralize any ordinary
    railroad engineer. . . . In Tunnel 15 they have already killed 500 men . . .
    from the effects of foul air, accidents, etc." He concluded with a jolly
    visit to the American engineer Van Brocklin at his home in Matucana:
    "gentlemen, well bred and thoroughly educated, roughing it, as you are
    obliged to do in a place like this, with rough unkempt beards, booted to the
    thighs, heavy ponchos on the shoulders, slouched hats, big spurs clanking, a
    revolver buckled in the waist." <br><br>One of MacConnell's 1873 letters was
    written off Talcahuano, Chile. He describes a long excursion into the
    country by rail to San Rosenda, Chile, and then 40 miles further on a
    construction train as far as Cabrera station. One final letter was written
    from Cairo, Egypt in 1879 while serving aboard the USS Monongahela.
