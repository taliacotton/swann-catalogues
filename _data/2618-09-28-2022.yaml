    Circa 1870s-80s<br><br>The Oread Institute was built by Eli Thayer of
    Worcester on a piece of land known as “Goat Hill” off Main Street in 1849.
    The Oread offered three levels of instruction: primary, academic, and
    collegiate. The four-year collegiate program offered a classical,
    college-level curriculum and is thought to be the first institution of its
    kind exclusively for women in the country. It was modeled after the program
    at Brown University, Thayer’s alma mater. The Oread taught women students
    for 32 years, from 1849–1881. Laura C. Spelman, later the wife of John D.
    Rockefeller, and her sister Lucy M. attended Oread in 1858. It later became
    The Worcester Domestic Science Cooking School (1898–1904) where, it is
    reputed, shredded wheat was invented. The Oread was razed in 1934.

    sculptural works, as well as two portraits of the influential artist.

    The archive includes a period album with about 30 photographs as well as a
    binder containing about 20 loose prints. The archive includes numerous
    beautifully lit and carefully composed images of Rodin's sculptures,
    including fine detail and dimensional renderings of the important work.
    Silver prints, the images measuring 9x6¾ inches (22.9x17.1 cm.), and
    smaller, the sheets slightly larger, nearly all with a title of the work in
    ink and/or Choumoff's stamp (some faint) on verso. Small folio, tan cloth;
    post binding; here the prints are mounted recto only and many are loose.
    Circa 1915-17<br><br>Pierre Choumoff was the last photographer Auguste Rodin
    worked with to document his sculptures. Rodin believed strongly in the
    ability of photography to disseminate his work, and the pair collaborated on
    300 images. Choumoff was able to use artificial lighting to control the
    surfaces of the sculptures, resulting in photographs that beautifully
    translate the surface texture, detail, and emotive dimensions Rodin
    achieved. Choumoff also photographed Rodin on his deathbed.

    commentary on this image in his book The Negative offers a poetic and
    practical glimpse into his skill as a practitioner and vision as a
    photographer: "The gilt crosses were blazing with the glare of sunlight. The
    stone of the church was fairly light, but if rendered 'literally' it would
    have competed with the crosses. Hence I exposed to keep the stone a middle
    value, and the foliage is thus quite dark. The sky was a deep blue and
    adequately separated in value from the stone. I made a second negative at
    one-half the exposure, but lost qualities in the shadows and in the foliage
    while gaining nothing with the values of the stone and cross. (The sky was
    deeper, but the effect was excessively theatrical.) With both negatives, the
    below-normal exposure had no effect on the glare from the crosses since that
    was far beyond the normal exposure scale of the film."<br><br>Ansel Adams,

    Adams wrote on this image in his book The Negative> describes not only the
    technical challenges of taking such a photograph but also explains the
    genius behind it: "I came across this extraordinary scene when returning to
    Santa Fe from an excursion to the Chama Valley. The sun was edging a
    fast-moving bank of clouds in the west. I set up the 8 x 10 camera as fast
    as I could while visualizing the image. I had to exchange the front and back
    elements of my Cooke lens, attaching the 23-inch element in front, with a
    glass G filter (#15) behind the shutter. I focused and composed the image
    rapidly at full aperture, but I knew that because of the focus-shift of the
    single lens component, I had to advance the focus about 3/32 inch when I
    used f/32. These mechanical processes and the visualization were intuitively
    accomplished. Then, to my dismay, I could not find my exposure meter! I
    remembered that the luminance of the moon at that position was about 250
    c/ft2; placing this luminance on Zone VII, I could calculate that 60 c/ ft2
    would fall on Zone V. With a film of ASA 64, the exposure would be 1/60
    second at f/8. Allowing a 3x exposure factor for the filter, the basic
    exposure was 1/20 second at f/8, or about one second at f/32, the exposure
    was given.  I had no idea what the foreground values were, but knowing they
    were quite low, I indicated water-bath development. The distant clouds were
    at least twice as luminous as the moon itself. The foreground density of the
    developed negative was about a Value II, and was locally strengthened by
    intensification in the Kodak IN-5 formula (quite permanent and colorless -
    see page 235). It was of utmost importance to preserve texture in the moon
    itself. We all have seen the blank white circle that represents the moon in
    many photographs, primarily caused by gross overexposure. "<br>Ansel Adams,

    on mount recto. 1922<br><br>Provenance: The Collection of Sheila Metzner,
    New York <br><br>This image appeared in German Vogue, February 2000. The
    tear sheet accompanies this lot. Here, the Queen of the Night design is
    attributed to Bakst, but elsewhere the dress itself is credited to House of
    Worth. The costume is made of a net of diamonds, incorporates a gold feather
    sun against a diamond tiara, and has a glittering silver fringe. <br>The
    original femme fatale, the Marchesa Luisa Casati aspired to be a work of
    art. And indeed, her eccentricities dominated and delighted European society
    for nearly three decades. She captivated artists and literati figures such
    as Giovanni Boldini, Man Ray, Jean Cocteau, Cecil Beaton, Ezra Pound, and
    Jack Kerouac, commissioning and inspiring numerous works of art. She remains
    a fashion muse today. <br>In 1910, Casati took up residence at the Palazzo
    dei Leoni, on the Grand Canal in Venice (now the home of the Peggy
    Guggenheim Collection). Her soirées there would become legendary. Casati
    collected a menagerie of exotic animals and a host of incredible stories,
    including walking her cheetahs with jeweled leads wearing nothing but furs.
    At a time when no respectable women wore makeup, she darkened her eyes with
    kohl and painted her mouth vermillion, accenting her green eyes with false
    eyelashes and hennaed hair. She wore live snakes as jewelry, tiger-skin top
    hats, ornamental eye patches, and once, the blood of a freshly killed
    chicken.

    F.S.A. credit stamp, a Farm Security Administration stamp, the typed title
    and date, and the RA number in pencil, on verso. 1936<br><br>Provenance:
    From the Collection of Romana Javitz; by descent to the Present Owner  
    <br><br>Romana Javitz (1903-80) was curator of The New York Public Library's
    Picture Collection from 1928-68, where she assembled one of the most
    historically important and artistically significant collections of
    20th-century photographs. An early champion of photography who said "great
    photography ranks with great art," she established personal relationships
    with Dorothea Lange, Lewis Hine, and Berenice Abbott, encouraging artists to
    bring her work, which she subsequently purchased for the library.<br><br>In
    1936, Javitz worked with Roy Stryker, head of the Farm Security
    Administration's Photographic Section to organize the files of the
    Resettlement Administration. She visited Washington D.C. to format the
    photographs into a collection, and he sent her duplicate prints of some work
    to ensure their preservation before it was clear that they would be
    preserved in D.C.<br><br>Javitz felt strongly about this material. The
    seminal text Words on Pictures (edited by Anthony T. Troncale) records
    interviews in which she discussed the body of work (the collection had,
    ultimately, 40,000 prints from the various photographers who worked for the
    F.S.A.), highlighting both the new documentary mode of image-making as well
    as the artistic success of the work. Javitz recalled "when the photographs
    came to us, they just gave us a completely new eye. It was really a third
    eye for all our trouble. You have no idea of what richness it meant to us.
    First of all, it was the first time that we had images that were clean cut.
    They weren't made to sell records or soap or whatnot" (p. 208). Her deep
    understanding of the material extended to the idea of the photo essay. "You
    have a sense that every picture is just like one word of a sentence," she
    said about Lange's work (p. 205) and describing FSA photographs generally
    arriving at the NYPL. Seeing just one is not enough, she
    argued.<br><br>"Curators of photographic collections-and I'm going to
    include Steichen-tried very hard to present photography as an art but
    actually photographs as documents is a much more exciting subject" (p. 230),
    Javitz said in one interview. Her strong sense of considering the image
    content first, created a dynamic collection of images in which the idea of
    hierarchies and isolation were simply not applicable.

  TYPESET: >-
    A pristine tri-folded pamphlet printed with red text and reproductions of
    work from each of the three photographers featured in the show, all then

    pamphlet corresponds to the touring show, and which included a total of 60
    works. With an introduction from curator John Szarkowski, a short
    biographical note on each photographer, and a full exhibition checklist.
    1967<br><br>In his introduction Szarkowski writes: "Most of those who were
    called documentary photographers a generation ago, when the label was new,
    made their pictures in the service of a social cause. It was their aim to
    show what was wrong with the world, and to persuade their fellows to take
    action and make it right.<br>In the past decade a new generation of
    photographers has directed the documentary approach toward more personal
    ends. Their aim has been not to reform life, but to know it. Their work
    betrays a sympathy--almost an affection--for the imperfections and the
    frailties of society. They like the real world, in spite of its terrors, as
    the source of all wonder and fascination and value, and find it no less
    precious for being irrational."
