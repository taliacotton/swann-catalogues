    10 Soho Square

    Nov. 30th 1859


    My Dear Sir,


    This morning I rec'd from Capt.n McClintock from Dublin, two charts with the
    Tracks of the Fox laid down. 


    I have transferred the tracks to a copy of the map which is to accompany his
    book, but I shall not get the engraving finished till tomorrow night & it
    will be the middle of the day on Friday before I can show you a proof. 


    Does McClintock's book bear the date 1859 or does it bear that of 1860?


    If you have a loose copy of the chart showing the drift of the Fox down
    Baffin Bay, be good enough to send it. 


    J. Arrowsmith

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    In 1816 the British organized a diplomatic mission to China, led by Lord
    Amherst, aimed at redressing commercial relations. Upon arrival in Peking
    Amherst refused to prostrate himself before the Emperor who in turn declined
    to grant him an audience thus negating the objective of the ambassador's
    mission. In early1817 the commission set off for their return journey but on
    February 18th the HMS Alceste ran aground of an unrecorded reef at the
    southern tip of Bangka Island. Although all made it to land, the ship was
    wrecked and lost. While the majority of crew stayed on the island awaiting
    later rescue, Amherst and the delegation were taken in the Alceste's brig
    Lyra south to Batavia, under the command of the Alceste's master, John
    Mayne. Upon their return to England, Mayne drew a chart of the
    wreck-site-to-Batavia leg of the voyage to accompany Henry Ellis's "Journal
    of the Proceedings of the Late Embassy to China" published in 1817. In that
    printed account appears an engraved reduced version of the present
    hand-drawn map.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Celebrated world map published in "Novus Orbis Regionum", Johann Huttich and
    Simon Grynaeus's 1532 anthology of early voyages. The geography of the map,
    outdated by the time of its publication, represents North America as a slim
    island region labeled "Terra de Cuba" and is a reversion to the
    Waldseemuller world map of 1507. Great advancement in the cartography of the
    New World had been made in these intervening 25 years. However, "What the
    Münster-Holbein map lacks in precision, it gains in richness of artistic
    decoration" (Shirley.)


    The elaborate woodcut borders were designed by the great Northern
    Renaissance painter Hans Holbein the Younger and enhance the map with a rich
    sense of artistic ornamentation. Imagery from around the world appears in
    the spandrels surrounding the globe which would have appeared quite
    fantastic to contemporary viewers: exotic animals and peoples, East Indian
    spices of nutmeg and pepper, an image of the Italian traveler Varthema
    journeying about, and a terrifying sight of cannibalism. At either pole,
    angels turn crank handles to rotate the world on its axis, an early
    reflection of the Copernican model which was not a widely explicit theory
    until the publication of his De Revolutionibus in 1543.


    As presently seen, the name of the Asian continent is printed in large block
    capitals and is the "version of the map normally associated with the earlier
    printings" -- Shirley 67.

    Massive chart referencing trade goods, raw materials, and other economic
    resources around the world, but with particular concentration on the naval
    strengths of Great Britain (vertical bar graph at left), Japan (center), and
    the United States (right); a focused intelligence chart by the Japanese
    Naval Department demonstrating the Empire's vulnerability as compared to
    other world powers. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the Allied
    nations of World War I from naval construction in the hopes of avoiding an
    international arms race; The London Naval Treaty of 1930 (two years after
    this map was published) sought to further increase regulations. Within
    several years Japan had officially renounced these sanctions with an eye
    towards major naval expansion, a clear concern and goal illustrated by this
    map, and an obvious indication that conflict was brewing.

    Evocative catalog of early 20th-century African shooting exploitations by
    three "great white hunters" from New York, Henry Pomeroy Davison, John H.
    Prentice, and Daniel E. Pomeroy, on their month and a half long big game
    chase in Sudan along the White Nile River between Khartoum and Bor. The
    excursion was not solely for sport - the men were also there to take trophy
    specimens for the American Museum of Natural History, for which Davison
    served as treasurer. For their own recreation, and institutional posterity,
    the venture appears to have been quite successful. 


    About half the images are ethnographic, illustrating local landscapes,
    villages, people and customs; the other half display the trio's conquests:
    crocodile, buffalo, antelope, hippopotamus, rhino, and elephant. 


    This trip is described in detail in Thomas W. Lamont's "Henry P. Davison,
    The Record of a Useful Life", 1933, pages 251-259; 334-367. A few excerpts
    here, for which the present collection of photographs serve as stark
    amplification: 


    "About 10 I decided to go out for hippo. At 11 I had a shot at one and
    missed him. In a few moments I had a shot at another as he raised his
    massive head to the surface of the water. As my bullet made no splash I knew
    I had hit him. He of course went down and there was nothing to do but await
    developments. True to the nature of the beast, he showed his back on the
    surface of the water just three hours later. We went out and towed him to
    shore. Such a beast, a monster. The natives, Dinkas, hovered about him like
    the ravishing dogs they are; and when the word was given, in they jumped
    with their knives and soon made the place look like a slaughter-house all
    fighting over each piece of meat and bone, the women standing by to divide
    the spoils. They welcome a shooting-party and gladly point out the game as
    it means meat to them". 


    "One evening Harry wounded a fair-sized bull elephant, and next morning he
    and I, with two gun bearers apiece, started out to look for him. We saw no
    trace of the wounded bull, and Harry seemed very much disappointed, more so,
    I think, than I ever saw him. I climbed to the top of a big ant hill, looked
    over all the country with my glasses, and saw about two miles away, a huge,
    solitary, bull elephant. Even at that distance, I could see he had wonderful
    ivory. I told this to Harry and he was as pleased as a boy, for it was his
    shot. We went up to the elephant which was standing in a sort of marsh. As
    we approached him, he began to move off at right angles to us. Harry shot
    him four times, and seemed to be hurting him. He was then about a hundred
    yards off. Much to our surprise, he turned like a polo pony and came right
    at us on a gallop. His trunk and tusks were held high in the air, and it was
    the most handsome sight, as Harry said, either of us had ever seen. There
    was not even a bush between us and him, and the only thing to do was to kill
    him or turn him. Harry and I each gave him two barrels in the head, and did
    not reach his brain. But he did not seem to care for it, and he turned and
    moved off slowly. We followed him up, and after a few more shots he went
    down. I have never in my life seen a more delighted man than Harry Davison
    was when he saw what a wonderful trophy he had. The tusks, which weighed
    eighty-five pounds apiece, are now in his house at Peacock Point, and I
    think that there are few larger outside of museums".


    "In going up to the bodies of the three dead rhino, to our utter amazement
    and chagrin, we found that we had killed three white "square-nosed" rhino.
    They are protected. We had permission to shoot one for the American Museum
    of Natural History, but to kill three, even by accident so to speak, was
    indeed bad news. I was worried about the rhino and suggested taking them out
    by the Belgian Congo, as they were fine specimens. Harry said : "Don't give
    it a thought, but let me do the talking when we get back to Khartum." When
    we arrived at Khartum, Harry arranged the whole matter in half an hour with
    Sir Reginald Wingate, Sirdar of the Sudan. The big rhino was to be mounted
    whole for the American Museum, and Harry and I, by paying £100 apiece, took
    the other two heads as museum specimens".

    "John Wilmerding, the leading authority on Lane, regards this view, Castine
    from Hospital Island, as this widely acclaimed artist's most accomplished
    work" (Reps, page 39). 


    "A lithograph of 1855 executed after sketches that he had made on his summer
    trips to Maine shows Castine from Hospital Island. The style is at last firm
    and fully controlled, and years of practice have produced a smooth pictorial
    scene characteristic of his best work. By this time he has noticeably
    lowered his horizon. The clouds, charged with mood and tangibility, are no
    longer a weak curtain drop in the background. The same sky and air uniformly
    fill all parts of the scene and draw the spectator directly into the view.
    Like most of the later lithographs, the Castine view is structurally simple,
    without the subtle complexities of Lane's larger oils of the same period.
    The treatment of the water in a slightly heavier stroke, delicately
    highlighted, gives it coherence and substance. Small areas of sails and
    wooden planks in the foreground, now lighted without exaggeration, direct
    the eye to the important parts or objects of activity, while never denying
    or overdramatizing the view as a whole. The scale, too, is completely
    proportioned and the point of view is even" (John Wilmerding, Fitz Hugh Lane
    American Marine Painter, 1964, Page 44).

    "A writer commenting on William Wall's advertisement for his views, which
    appeared in the 26 June 1823 issue of the Commercial Advertiser, noted a few
    days later in the same paper that the 'views taken by Mr. Wall are the most
    accurate description that we have seen. One of them is taken from Brooklyn
    Heights, near the Distillery of the Messrs. Pierponts, and the other from
    the Mountain at Weehawk. Mr. W. at first made a drawing from the high land
    back of Hoboken; but the view from Weehawk is far preferable, as it not only
    affords a commanding prospect of the city but also of the whole of our
    beautiful harbor, with all the islands, &c.'" -- Deak 336.
