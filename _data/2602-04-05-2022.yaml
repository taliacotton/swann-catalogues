    or trimmed on the plate mark, with the complete composition preserved.  A
    superb, well-inked impression of this exceedingly scarce, early engraving
    with strong contrasts.<br><br>We have not found another impression of this
    engraving at auction in the past 30 years.<br><br>According to the Art
    Institute of Chicago, which has in their collection a similar impression of
    this subject, "In this deeply engraved, drawing-like print, Christ strides
    over the demolished gates of hell, carrying a victory standard.  On the
    right, Adam and Eve are seen with their righteous son Abel, while Cain has
    been left in hell for murdering his brother.  The demons that represent the
    torments of hell herald Christ’s arrival.  These devils, with their scales
    and reptilian tails, resemble dragons, and have elf-like ears.  They seem to
    be flying, one of them distractedly doing acrobatic tricks instead of
    blowing his horn."<br><br>Oberhuber and Sheehan note that this is likely one
    of four subjects in an incomplete series of similar size, large upright
    format engravings done in the studio of Mantegna (1431-1506) and, "Like the
    others in the series, it was probably executed around the middle of the
    1470s by the engraver whom we suspect to have been Zoan Andrea, copied from
    a drawing by Mantegna dating about two decades earlier.  There is a drawing
    very similar to the print in the École des Beaux-Arts, Paris, in the same
    sense and of nearly equal size.  The drawing differs from the engraving in a
    number of details which it has in common with a painting of the subject by
    Giovanni Bellini in the Bristol City Art Gallery, for which it clearly
    served as a model.  Byam Shaw consequently considered it to be Bellini's
    copy of the print, preparatory for the picture.  Robertson, on the other
    hand, has made a number of compelling observations in favor of the
    attribution of the drawing to Mantegna" (see  Early Italian Engravings from
    the National Gallery of Art , Washington, D.C., 1973, page 208).  Bartsch 5;

  CROSSHEAD: ' Saint John the Baptist .'
  TYPESET: >-
    Engraving and stipple-engraving, circa 1505.  283x232 mm; 11¼x9¼ inches. 
    Bull's head with a cross and the letters S M in a circle watermark (Briquet
    15396, which dates from circa 1500-10 and is found on imprints from Treviso
    and Innsbruck at this time).  Trimmed on or just inside the plate mark on
    three sides and inside the plate mark in the upper blank space, with the
    subject preserved.  A good and early impression of this exceedingly scarce,
    Italian Renaissance engraving.<br><br>We have found only one other
    impression at auction in the past 30 years, a later impression with a
    watermark from the second half of the 16th century (sold Christie's, London,
    March 31, 2010, lot 36).<br><br>Campagnola's (1482-1515) importance as an
    early printmaker and Renaissance artist owes to his introduction of the
    stipple-engraving technique, which produced shading using dots made by the
    point of the graver on the metal plate.  According to Landau and Parshall,
    "The innovation allowed a much greater range of tone from white to black,
    and at the same time a more controllable graduated transition between
    lighter and darker areas of the image.  The disadvantages of the technique
    were that it was immensely more time-consuming than ordinary engraving, that
    the dots produced, unless of sufficient size, would wear down quite quickly,
    and, finally, that it was extremely difficult to freshen-up a tired-looking
    plate by re-engraving it--a common strategy in printmaking.  Whereas pushing
    the burin along the existing, shallowed grooves was a well-tried and
    effective method of freshening worn plates, hitting again the myriad of of
    existing dots was an impossible task, and creating new dots would easily
    produce patches of ink where new and old dots joined together.  This is
    precisely why there are no known instances of Giulio's plates being reworked
    in later states by retouching the dotted areas of the image," (Landau and
    Parshall,  The Renaissance Print , New Haven/London, 1994, page
    261).<br><br>It has been widely accepted that Campagnola adapted the figure
    of Saint John the Baptist from a now lost drawing by Andrea Mantegna
    (1431-1506) while the landscape was supplied contemporaneously by Giorgione
    (circa 1477/78-1510) working closely with the Campagnola.  There is an ink
    drawing now in the Louvre, Paris, with the landscape rendered in reverse of
    the print, by Giorgione, that is believed to be the source for Campagnola's
    landscape in  Saint John the Baptist .  It appears that Giorgione
    intentionally left the space for the figure blank in his landscape drawing,
    as Campagnola already had his figure from a design by Mantegna engraved on
    the plate, and that sometime thereafter none other than Titian (1488-1576)
    drew in his own representation of Saint John the Baptist on the Louvre,
    Paris sheet.  Bartsch 3; Hind 12.

    Engraving, circa 1496-1500.  303x280 mm; 12x11¼ inches, narrow margins. 
    Cross on a mound watermark.  A very good impression of this scarce, early
    engraving, with strong contrasts and little to no sign of wear.<br><br>This
    engraving is based on Filippino Lippi's (1457-1504) painting of the same
    subject, which dates from 1496 and is now in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. 
    Robetta (circa 1462-circa 1535) also adopted passages from other
    contemporaneous prints.  The hat above his signature, for instance, is
    copied from Martin Schongauer's  Adoration of the Magi , engraving, circa
    1475 (Lehrs 6), as are the heads of the ox and ass to the viewer's right of
    the Virgin and Child.  Meanwhile, the landscape derives from prints by
    Albrecht Dürer and the sky is based on his  Virgin and Child with the
    Monkey  (Bartsch 42, see lot 14) and  The Sea Monster  (Bartsch 71).  The
    original copper plate for  The Adoration of the Magi  is now in the British
    Museum, London, and many extant impressions were printed during the 19th
    century; earlier printings such as the current work are extremely scarce.

    was born in the village of Landser with one head, four ears, two bodies,
    eight feet, on six of which it stood, and with two tongues.'  Dürer
    (1471-1528) could not have seen this pig which only lived for one day, but
    he knew the broadside: the pig is shown in a different position to that
    crudely cut image, but the building in the background represents the castle

    richly-inked and early Meder II a impression, with the short vertical
    scratch under the center of the bridge, with burr in the heavily shaded
    parts of the mountains, notably at the right,  with the delicate horizontal
    scratch between the drapery and the upper left thigh, with several delicate
    scratches in the upper feathers, with particularly strong contrasts and no
    sign of wear, consistent with the earliest lifetime impressions in this
    state.  Partial bull's head (?) watermark at the extreme lower edge of the
    sheet (Meder 62, which he dates from the mid to late 1400s).  Trimmed on the
    plate mark.  An extremely scarce impression in this quality, with the wings
    black and great clarity in the landscape, with every detail
    distinct.<br><br>The early 1500s was a period of dramatic growth in Dürer's
    (1471-1528) career and the fuller recognition of Italianate influence in his
    art.  His workshop expanded with his increasing popularity, enhanced
    significantly by the wide-scale distribution of his engravings and woodcuts
    throughout Europe, with the addition of three young artists: Hans Baldung
    Grien (1480-1545), Hans van Kulmbach (circa 1485-1522) and Hans Schäufelein
    (circa 1482-1539/40).  Dürer was preoccupied with a focus on the
    construction and proportion of the human figure at this time too,
    doubtlessly on account of his knowledge of Italian Renaissance art and
    recent travel to northern Italy, creating numerous drawings of standing
    female nudes and two of his most important engravings on the subject,  The
    Nemesis  and  Adam and Eve , 1504.<br><br>According to Bartrum, there is a
    preparatory ink drawing for  The Nemesis , now at the British Museum,
    London, which, "Is the earliest occasion that a proportionately constructed
    figure appears in one of his prints . . . The drawing also shows that Dürer
    originally planned a smaller, different type of wing, with the tips hanging
    down," (Bartrum,  Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy , London, 2002, page 73).  A
    separate study of wings on the same sheet shows how he ultimately intended
    to make them on the engraving, larger and much more intricately detailed. 
    Dürer's handling of the figure of  The Nemesis  or Fortune was striking and
    revolutionary for its time, starkly silhouetted against the blank white
    background of the sheet of paper and floating ethereally along a
    drapery-like cloud lining above a minutely detailed
    landscape.<br><br>Bartrum notes that the subject, "Comes from the Latin
    poem  Manto  (Mantua) written by the Italian poet and philosopher Angelo
    Poliziano (1454-1494) and printed by Aldus Manutius in Venice in 1498. 
    Dürer probably became acquainted with it through Pirckheimer (the humanist
    and Nuremberg friend of the artist).  Nemesis, the classical god of
    retribution, whose goblet and bridle represent reward and castigation, is
    combined with the traditional winged figure of Fortune standing on a globe. 
    The landscape beneath has been identified as a view of Chiusa in the
    southern Tyrol (Alto Adige), of which Dürer had presumably made a drawing
    during his journey to Italy in 1494-95, although no record survives,"
    (Bartrum, page 140).  Bartsch 77; Meder 72.

    another impression of this subject, "Though the image obviously shows a
    repentant man flagellating himself, more specific identification remains
    elusive.  The image is sometimes described as a self-portrait; indeed, the
    man's features are not unlike the artist's, and Dürer did have a penchant
    for self-portraiture, both explicit and disguised.  The ark on the altar has
    prompted another plausible suggestion--that the figure is David, the Old
    Testament king who repented and whose penitential prayer is Psalm 51.  If
    so, Dürer appears to have followed the spirit rather than the letter of the
    second book of Samuel 11-12, which records the story of the king's
    repentance after his sinful treatment of Bathsheba, and her husband Uriah. 
    The account makes no mention of self-flagellation.  Still, the lack of
    Christian symbols couple with a temple-like setting suggest an Old Testament
    subject."  Bartsch 119; Meder 108.

    at the far right, representing traces of a projected building, distinct,
    before the scratches to the left of the cross, with strong contrasts, no
    sign of wear and crisp, partially inky plate edges, consistent with the
    earliest impressions of this subject.<br><br>Dürer's (1471-1528) engraving
    of  St. Anthony , dating from the height of his career, shows the saint
    hunched over and reading on the outskirts of a fortified city (identified by
    the art historian Tietze as combining elements of Trent, Innsbruck and
    Nuremberg, though recognized by the Dürer scholar Thausing as adopted from a
    drawing titled  Pvpila Avgvsta  made by Dürer some 20 years earlier).  The
    setting is in stark contrast to other contemporaneous Renaissance images of
    St. Anthony, more commonly depicting the saint tormented by demons, enduring
    Satan's temptation.<br><br>Dürer must have been particularly proud of this
    engraving, as he gave it as a gift — along with impressions of his more
    famous  St. Jerome  in his study — to several prominent figures on at least
    six occasions during his 1520-21 trip to the Low Countries.  In his diary
    entry for September 3, 1529, from Antwerp, he wrote, "I gave Wilhelm
    Hauenhut, equerry of Duke Frederick Palatine, an engraved 'St. Jerome' and
    the two new half-sheets: The Virgin and 'Anthoni'."<br><br>Scholars from
    Panofsky onward have remarked on the "modern" aspect of the composition, in
    which the huddled form of St. Anthony echoes that of the walled city behind
    him.  "The scenery almost dominates the composition.  It is here a
    'cubistic' phenomenon, exclusively composed of such clear-cut stereometric
    solids as prisms, cubes, pyramids, and cylinders which bring to mind a
    cluster of crystals," (Panofsky, 1943, volume I, p. 201).  In this context,
    one cannot help but to recall Cézanne's pre-cubistic landscape renderings of
    Mont Sainte-Victoire, which in turn so profoundly influenced Picasso and
    Braque and the foundations of 20th century modern art.<br><br>Provenance:

    Solomon's 700 wives and 300 concubines points to the statue, instructing
    Solomon to adore Moloch.  By adorning the domineering woman with a feathered
    hat, Lucas van Leyden (1494-1533) emphasized her foreignness and dangerous

    chronicler Giorgio Vasari credited Raimondi and Raphael with inventing
    "reproductive printmaking" and thereby the market for prints made after
    famous paintings and sculpture, which is still thriving to this day.  Vasari
    claimed that Raimondi's engravings were produced after paintings and
    frescoes by Raphael and that Raphael had a significant role in the
    production and marketing of these engravings, though recent scholarship has
    shown that for the most part Raimondi (and his "school" or workshop,
    including Agostino Veneziano and Marco Dente) worked from drawings by
    Raphael and that the engraver took the lead in popularizing these prints. 
    Nevertheless, Raphael and Raimondi were clearly close collaborators. 
    Raimondi was depicted as a  sediario  in Raphael's fresco in the  Stanza di
    Eliodoro , 1511, of the famous Vatican  Stanze ; he acted as a witness in
    Raphael's purchase of two houses in Rome in 1515; and Raimondi engraved an
    intimate portrait of Raphael around 1518 (Bartsch 496).<br><br> The Judgment
    of Paris  is based on a small  grisaille  painting by a member of Raphael's
    school in the  Stanza della Segnatura  of the Vatican  Stanze  and the
    existence of several copies of lost drawings of this composition indicate
    more direct ties to Raphael himself.  This famous composition has been
    appropriated, in whole and parts, by many artists over the centuries, most
    notably by Édouard Manet in  Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe , 1862-63, now in the
    Musée d'Orsay, Paris.  Bartsch 245.

    completed between 1514 and 1517 and though it is assumed that Raphael did
    make the designs for the complex composition, the fresco was most likely
    painted and completed by his assistant Giulio Romano (1499-1546).  The scene
    depicts Pope Leo IV halting a fire in 847 with a benediction from a balcony

    working with the printmaker Antonio da Trento (1520-1550), who, according to
    the 16th century artist and biographer Giorgio Vasari, also lived with the
    artist.  Their collaboration led to highly skilled compositions, including

    strong contrasts and little to no sign of wear.<br><br>According to the
    Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, which has in the collection another
    impression of this engraving, "This print comes from the museum’s copy of
    the  Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae  (The Mirror of Roman Magnificence). 
    The  Speculum  found its origin in the publishing endeavors of Antonio
    Salamanca and Antonio Lafreri.  During their Roman publishing careers, the
    two foreign publishers--who worked together between 1553 and 1563--initiated
    the production of prints recording art works, architecture and city views
    related to Antique and Modern Rome.  The prints could be bought individually
    by tourists and collectors, but were also purchased in larger groups which
    were often bound together in an album.  In 1573, Lafreri commissioned a
    title page for this purpose, which is where the title  Speculum Romanae
    Magnificentiae  first appears.  Lafreri envisioned an ideal arrangement of
    the prints in seven different categories, but during his lifetime, never
    appears to have offered one standard, bound set of prints.  Instead, clients
    composed their own selection from the corpus to be bound, or collected a
    group of prints over time.  When Lafreri died, two-third of the existing
    copper plates went to the Duchetti family (Claudio and Stefano), while
    another third was distributed among several publishers.  The Duchetti appear
    to have standardized production, offering a more or less uniform version of
    the  Speculum  to their clients.  The popularity of the prints also inspired
    other publishers in Rome to make copies however, and to add new prints to
    the corpus.<br><br>Bos' (circa 1520-circa 1580) engraving depicts the famous
    Ancient Roman marble sculpture of the hero Hercules, originally made for the
    Baths of Caracalla in Rome.  This massive sculpture got its current name
    after its rediscovery in 1546, when it entered the collection of  Cardinal
    Alessandro Farnese, grandson of Pope Paul III.  Hollstein 15

    and can also be seen in Bruegel's popular 1559 oil painting  The Battle
    between Carnaval and Lent .  They note, "Sixteenth century folk culture
    included an extensive repertoire of popular games and plays performed in the
    period around Shrove Tuesday.  The subject matter often related to the
    'driving out' or 'fleeing' of winter.  For the most part, it is hard to work
    out nowadays precisely how these plays were performed, and we are equally
    ignorant as to their content, since a great many of the texts have failed to
    survive.  The story of  The Dirty Bride ('Vuyl Bruyt')  seems to hark back
    to an earlier variation, in which a 'vuyle druyt' or 'dirty vagrant'
    personifying winter was driven out of a hedge to herald spring.  Over time,
    the figure changed sex, until spring was announced by the first call of the
    cuckoo and the dirty bride leaving her ramshackle home."  Hollstein 80;

    the other, with the former alluding to people of modest means and the latter
    to the rich and powerful.  Yet this is actually a free-for-all, piggy banks
    (or rather  spaarpotjes --literally savings pots), strong boxes, money bags,
    purses and barrels of cash against each other.  Some of these combatants
    have heads, while others do not; but they are all heavily armed and have
    limbs with which they lay about one another fiercely . . . A theme such as
    greed--and above all the contrast between personal enrichment on the one

    the metropolis of Antwerp, with its rapidly emerging merchantile elite."

    impression of this extremely scarce etching.<br><br>According to DeGrazia,
    in  The Holy Family with Saint John the Baptist , Annibale purposely left
    his contour lines broken and discontinuous to merge his figures with the
    surrounding atmosphere.  This is especially evident in the left arm of the
    Virgin, which is almost part of the foliage in the background.  These broken
    contour lines also add to the effect of movement of the forms, giving a kind
    of shimmering quality to the whole."  Bartsch 11; DeGrazia 11.

    Etching.  405x528 mm; 16x21 inches.  Fleur-de-lys in a circle watermark. 
    With thread margins or trimmed on the plate mark.  A very good impression of
    this large, scarce etching.<br><br>According to Nicolaas Teeuwisse, Berlin,
    who offered another impression of this subject in  Selected Works XVII 
    catalogue, 2017, "The painter and engraver Pietro Francesco Alberti
    (1584-1638) was a descendant of a large, well-known family of artists who
    originated from Borgo San Sepolcro.  He worked almost exclusively in Rome,
    where he was a member of the  Accademia di S. Luca .  This delightful,
    large-scale depiction of a painting academy is the only print the artist
    ever made and therefore a precious rarity.<br><br>The composition owes its
    appeal to the wealth of sensitively and humorously observed details.  We see
    a spacious hall in which students and teachers, in keeping with the artistic
    theories of the Renaissance, are engaged in a large number of different
    disciplines, such as mathematics, anatomy, architecture, sculpture and
    drawing.  Through the wide-open window daylight streams into the sparsely
    furnished interior.  On the left, a young student presenting a letter of
    recommendation is being admitted to the vast classroom.  Fragments of
    ancient sculpture and plaster casts stand on a shelf or are fastened to the
    wall by a nail.  The three paintings hanging on the wall symbolize the
    different genres of religious painting, portraiture and landscape painting. 
    In an exemplary way the individual disciplines are shown, which art students
    had to complete in order to develop into artists with an all-round humanist
    education."<br><br>Alberti's choice of subject might have also tied into the
    popular contemporaneous artists' academy in Bologna founded around 1582 by
    the Carracci family: Annibale, Agostino and Ludovico.  Initially named the 
    Accademia dei Desiderosi  (Academy of the Desirous), the school most likely
    began as an informal gathering of young artists in Ludovico Carracci's
    studio.  Around 1590, the academy was renamed the  Accademia degli
    Incamminati  (Academy of Those who are Making Progress or Academy of the
    Journeying), and adopted a more didactic academic program.  There is some
    debate regarding the school's organization and academic structure.  However,
    it is likely that the academy functioned as a combination of a painters'
    workshop and a formal institution, and was attended by both students and
    established artists alike.  Bartsch 1.

    productions.  He returned to Nancy in 1621, renowned as a printmaker of

    Callot returned to this ambitious, cataclysmic subject, which he had treated
    first in 1617, just before his death.  It may reflect his horror at the

    singular images of himself and several others of himself in different guises

    age of 27, just two years after he had moved to Amsterdam from Leyden to
    begin to establish himself as a successful independent artist, and months
    before he married Saskia van Uylenburgh, is among Rembrandt's most
    introspective self-renderings.  The dark shading covering much of his face
    (which rapidly disappears in later impressions), the deep-set eyes and his
    quiet, hunched pose lend an almost shy, reserved appearance, which is
    markedly different from the proud, expressive, frontal poses of his
    self-portraits he made from the mid-to-late-1630s.<br><br>Provenance: State

  TYPESET: >-
    Pen and dark brownish black ink and wash on blue laid paper, circa 1634. 
    205x130 mm; 8¼x5¼ inches (irregular edges).<br><br>This drawing has recently
    been attributed to Rembrandt (1606-1669) by Martin Royalton-Kisch,  The
    Drawings of Rembrandt, A Revision of Otto Benesch's Catalogue Raisonné ,
    online catalogue (https://rembrandtcatalogue.net), as the original study of
    another drawing catalogued by Benesch as Rembrandt (Benesch
    0124).<br><br>Royalton-Kisch notes, "In style it is reminiscent of works by
    Govert Flinck (1615-1660); yet the latter’s Rembrandtesque drawings
    generally have a more hesitant or fragmented style, less fluid and confident
    than the approach here (cf. Benesch 0061-62 and Benesch 0079-80, as well as
    his  Musketeer in Copenhagen , Sumowski 953x and Benesch 0656). Furthermore,
    there are analogies with Rembrandt’s own works, especially with the
    documentary drawing of 1634 in the Burchard Grossmann album (Benesch 0257):
    the zigzag hatching to the right of the figure’s feet resembles that in the
    right background of Benesch 0257; similarly, the hatching in the figure’s
    drapery is generally a close match between the two drawings.  The effect of
    the shading is subtler and less harsh than the shading in Flinck’s drawings
    in Rembrandt’s manner (cf. Benesch 0002, Benesch 0048 and Benesch 0111-12). 
    The hooked line around the back of the collar that runs over the nearer
    shoulder also resembles Rembrandt’s touch in the nearer sleeve of the
    Grossmann album drawing.  The latter also employs an unusual 'blocking out’
    of the facial features with bold touches of the pen, which is not unlike the
    approach in the present drawing, although in Benesch 0257 the light rakes
    across the face, highlighting the features clearly, whereas here the light
    comes from behind the head, casting the face as a whole into shadow.  This
    dark chiaroscuro, with the face almost in darkness, is a bold experiment;
    and the similarly inky-black shadows in the shoulder and in the nearer,
    right sleeve also have their counterparts in Benesch 0257, in the nearer
    sleeve and in both edges of the collar.  A comparable effect occurs in
    Benesch 0049.  In the present drawing, the contrasts appear
    stronger--blotchier, even--perhaps because of the darkened overall condition
    of the paper as well as the use of a darker shade of ink.  On close
    inspection, the artist has left some glimmer of light in the nearer eye, on
    the further brow, and in the tip of the nose.  The drapery sketch at the top
    left should be compared with Rembrandt’s collar in Benesch 0432, which
    exhibits a similar approach with untouched areas firmly ‘closed’ by strong
    and clear penlines (though the chiaroscuro is lessened here because of the
    drawing’s condition).  In sum, the attribution of the present drawing to
    Rembrandt rather than Flinck appears to be more than adequately supported by
    the stylistic evidence."<br><br>There are also similarities in this drawing
    to the extremely scarce, early, sketch-like etching of  St. Peter and St.
    John at the Gate of the Temple: Roughly Etched , circa 1629 (Bartsch 95; New
    Hollstein 15).<br><br>Provenance: Private collection, Brittany, France;

    godfather of their first child, their son Rumbartus (who died just two
    months after his birth in 1635).  Having served as a minister for the Dutch
    Reformed Church in several Frisian communities, he was called to Sloten near
    Amsterdam and the Gasthuiskerk in the city itself in 1610, and after 1622
    was employed at the Oude Kerk.  Rembrandt made another, posthumous portrait

    distinct.<br><br>Cornelis Claesz Anslo (1592-1646) was a prominent Mennonite
    preacher in Amsterdam who was portrayed by Rembrandt several times in
    paintings, drawings and this etching.  He was the fourth son of the
    Norwegian born Dutch cloth merchant Claes Claesz Anslo, whose other sons all
    entered the family cloth business.  Anslo's father founded a  hofje  (or
    courtyard with almshouses) in Amsterdam that the Anslo brothers managed
    during their lifetime.  The  hofje  was partially demolished and rebuilt on
    the original location, today's Eglantierstaat 52, nearby the Anne Frank
    house and a short walk across the city from Rembrandt's house.  Bartsch 271;

    Hollstein's fifth state (of 5).  With thread margins or trimmed on the plate

    to no sign of wear.<br><br>According to the Dallas Museum of Art, there is
    an impression of this subject in the collection, "The story depicted in this
    etching revolves around Jason, the leader of the Argonauts, and his
    abduction of Creusa, the beautiful, young and wealthy daughter of Creon,
    King of Corinth.  When Jason’s wife, the sorceress Medea, learns of Jason’s
    plans to marry Creusa, she seeks revenge by poisoning Creusa and her father
    and killing her own two sons.  In this illustration, Rembrandt took
    considerable artistic liberties as he invented a scene that is not described
    in any line of the play,  Medea: or the Marriage of Jason and Creusa .  Set
    in a church, the subject might be mistaken for a Biblical scene if it were
    not for the female figure in the foreground, who holds Medea’s trademark
    weapons of a dagger and a container of poison.  Bartsch 112; Biörklund 48-E;

    dark and richly-inked impression of this large, scarce, important etching,
    with burr on the head and back of the woman holding the baby before Christ's
    outstretched right arm.<br><br>The original copper plate for this etching
    was owned by a Dutch collector after Rembrandt's (1606-1669) death and was
    sold to the American artist John Greenwood (1727-1792) around 1775. 
    Greenwood originally worked in Boston and during the early 1770s relocated
    to London, where in addition to continuing to practice as a portrait painter
    and engraver, he became a successful art dealer.  He owned  The Hundred
    Guilder Print  plate for just a short time, selling it to Captain William
    Baillie (1723-1810), an officer in the English army and a professional
    printmaker, who after acquiring the plate, reworked it and issued an
    "edition" of some 100 impressions before ultimately cutting up the plate,
    and further printing impressions from four different pieces of the
    plate.<br><br>According to a summary of this important etching by Luijten,
    "That it is known in only two 17th century states, with the minor difference
    between them of additional shading over the neck of the donkey on the right
    and the far wall of the archway, belies the exceptional effort that the
    plate represents in terms of imaginative power, technical brilliance and
    pictorial finish.  Rembrandt applies every tool at his command and in a
    variety of styles, from the freely outlined Pharisees in debate on the left,
    flooded in light, to the precise rendering of the textures that apparel the
    figures who enter from the right.  All the groups are subjugated to the
    overriding  chiaroscuro , which ranges from the deep blacks into which
    Christ's halo melts away, to the areas left white which suggest a sudden
    source of startling illumination.  The play of shadows is nowhere made more
    manifest than by the dark silhouette cast on Christ's robe by the central
    figure with praying hands," ( Rembrandt the Printmaker , London, 2000,
    pages253-54).  Bartsch 74; Biörklund 49-1; Hollstein (White and Boon) 74;

    with strong contrasts, and little to no sign of wear.<br><br>Clement de
    Jonghe (1624/25-1677) was among the largest Amsterdam print and map dealers
    and publishers during the mid-17th century and would certainly have been
    associated with Rembrandt (1606-1669), though there is no indication,
    through letters or in the inventory drawn up after Clement de Jonghe's
    death, that this was a commissioned portrait.  De Jonge's business prospered
    from at least around 1647 to 1679, run posthumously for a couple of years
    following his death by his widow Jacomijntje Jacobs, until his stock was
    sold at auction.  De Jonghe acquired at least 74 of Rembrandt's original
    etched copper plates, probably during Rembrandt's lifetime, and these were
    all sold in the contents of his estate auction.  Bartsch 272; Biörklund

    very good, dark and well-inked impression, with the landscape through the
    window still distinct.<br><br>Francen (1612-after 1678) was a close friend
    of Rembrandt and a lifelong resident of Amsterdam (though records of the
    various addresses in the city where he lived indicate that he was not a
    particularly well-to-do collector).  He was a passionate connoisseur of art,
    which Rembrandt alludes to with the Crucifixion triptych and the landscape
    painting on the wall of Francen's study, as well as the Taoist sculpture on
    the table, and in this collecting eclecticism he and Rembrandt surely had a
    kinship.<br><br>Francen testified for Rembrandt and helped support him
    through his financial difficulties in the 1650s and 1660s; he also acted as
    a sort of guardian for Rembrandt's only child (of four) to survive into
    adulthood, Titus (1641-1668).  Rembrandt likely made this etched portrait of
    Francen out of friendship rather than as a paid commission.   Bartsch 273;

    figure in a circle watermark.  From the  Five Deaths  series.  A very good
    impression of this scarce etching with strong contrasts.<br><br>According to
    the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, which has both an impression of
    this subject and a preparatory drawing for the etching, "Della Bella
    (1610-1664) was supported by the Medici for many years, primarily in
    Florence, but also in Rome, where his patron Lorenzo sponsored a period of
    study in the mid-1630s. In 1639, Della Bella traveled to France with the
    ambassador of the grand duke of Tuscany and remained there for over a
    decade.<br><br>It was probably during his last years in France that Della
    Bella began an updated version of the  Dance of Death .  This typically
    Northern and medieval subject usually showed Death in a variety of
    situations, carrying away victims of every age and walk of life.  While in
    France, Della Bella etched four oval scenes of Death's conquest, including
    this print  Death Carrying off a Child , three of which take place in
    cemeteries and the fourth on the battlefield.  A horizontal version of Death
    triumphing in war probably also dates to these years.  At the end of his
    life, Della Bella took up the theme again, creating three more episodes in
    the oval format—two of these were left incomplete at his death.  In the
    early prints particularly, Death is as energetic as he is ruthless—here he
    rushes into the cemetery bearing a screaming and struggling child.  The
    setting is the Cemetery of the Innocents in Paris, a site with which Della
    Bella was undoubtedly familiar, since many publishers and print dealers had
    their shops on the ground floor of the charnel houses."  DeVesme 89.

    etching with strong contrasts and little to no sign of

    540s BC to 522 BC.  He had a reputation as both a fierce warrior and an
    enlightened ruler.  Polycrates met his end during the Persian invasion of
    Greece in 1522.  He was double-crossed by the Persian leader Oroetes and
    assassinated.  The historian Herodotus is vague about the manner of
    Polycrates' death, saying only that it was an undignified end for a glorious
    ruler; he may have been impaled and his dead body was crucified.  Rosa
    (1615-1673) captures this undignified manner of death in his
    representation.<br><br>There is an oil painting by Rosa of the same subject,
    on which the etching is loosely-based, in the Art Institute of Chicago. 
    There is also a finished study for the etching, done in chalk, by Rosa in
    the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.  Bartsch 10; Wallace 111.

    or  vedutista  and printmaker, famous for his etched  vedute  of European
    cities such as Dresden, Vienna, Turin and Warsaw.  He was the student and
    nephew of Antonio da Canal, Il Canaletto, and sometimes used his uncle's
    illustrious name, signing as Bernardo Canaletto. In Germany and Poland,
    Bellotto simply called himself by his uncle's name, Canaletto, causing some
    confusion.  Bellotto's style was characterized by elaborate representation
    of architectural and natural vistas, and by the specific quality of each
    place's lighting.  It is plausible that Bellotto, and other Venetian masters
    of  vedute  at this time, may have used the camera obscura in order to
    achieve superior precision of urban views.  DeVesme 11.

    Fiumicino (at the sea), were handled.  The building of the  muraglioni 
    (massive flood prevention walls) at the end of the 19th century has since
    erased the existence and function of the  Porto di Ripa Grande .  The  Porto
    di Ripetta  was a port in the city of Rome, located in front of the church
    of San Girolamo degli Schiavoni, designed and built in 1704 by the Italian
    Baroque architect Alessandro Specchi.  Situated on the left bank of the
    Tiber River (facing south), this was the place to alight for travel
    downriver; as the  Porto di Ripa Grande  on the other bank in Trastevere
    served travel from the seaward side of the city.  The Ponte Cavour was
    constructed across the Tiber and opened in 1901, at which point the  Porto
    di Ripetta  was demolished.  Hind 27 and 28.

    strong.<br><br>Debucourt's (1755-1832)  La Promenade Publique  was published
    in Paris in the first half of 1792.  The second half of the same year saw
    riots, the August 10, 1792 massacre of Louis XVI's Swiss Guards, the descent
    into chaos of the Legislative Assembly, foreign invasion, the abolition of
    the monarchy and with that the abolition of the year itself: September 22,
    1792 became day one of month one of year one of the new Republican
    Calendar.  Debucourt's print shows the Parisian aristocrats at play before
    the French Revolution erupted and their demise: dancing, gambling and
    gossiping.<br><br>According to Ittmann, "The fops vie with the infamous
    beauties of the day, innocently unaware of the impending massacres of
    September 1792.  Debucourt dared to include portraits of the little,
    pink-clad duc d'Aumount indolently sprawling across three chairs and the
    future Louis XVIII, then the duc de Chartres, simpering on tiptoe to blow a
    kiss to an admiring friend, little more than a year before the execution of
    his father, Philippe-Egalité.  Probably for this reason, Debucourt chose to
    issue this print without the usual fanfare of a press announcement and
    inscribed it with the address of the printseller Depeuille instead of his
    own," ( Regency to Empire, French Printmaking 1715-1814 , Minneapolis, 1984,

    Eastbourne (Victoria and Albert Museum, E.328–1961; for the painting see
    Sunderland 1986, number 107).  Another etching after the same drawing, by
    Mortimer’s collaborator Robert Blyth and published in 1782, has been claimed
    to be a later state of the present print, but is from a different plate: as
    well as many differences of detail, the tonalities capture none of the
    dramatic atmosphere and stark lighting.  Mortimer did not make many prints,
    but in 1775–76 he produced a set of 12 heads of figures from Shakespeare
    that have very much the same character and technique seen here.  It seems
    therefore that the present plate was etched by Mortimer himself and that

    (1780-1867)  Odalisque  (or  La Grande Odalisque ) created a scandal when
    the painting was first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1819. Critics
    lambasted Ingres for his rebellious lack of realism and the elongated
    proportions of the figure. While likely deliberate distortions on the part
    of Ingres, the figure was shown to have several too many vertebrae and was
    drawn with a curvature of the spine and rotation of the pelvis impossible to
    replicate in life.<br><br>The painting was commissioned from Ingres by
    Napoleon's sister, Queen Caroline Murat of Naples, and completed in 1814.
    This lithograph, one of fewer than ten different lithographs created by
    Ingres, was published shortly after the painting had been widely exhibited

    leading draftsmen of controversial and highly critical political caricatures
    that cleverly captured the political strife prevalent throughout France in
    the 19th century.  Born in Marseilles and raised in Paris, Daumier began
    studying art in 1822 under painter Alexandre Lenior, thereafter he enrolled
    for a short time in the Académie Suisse, and continued training as an
    apprentice under master lithographer Zépherin Belliard.  By 1830 he was
    producing caricatures depicting the foibles of the bourgeoisie and the
    corruption of the government for Charles Philipon's satirical political
    newspaper  Le Caricature .  The scathing political caricatures Daumier
    produced for  Le Caricature  and Philipon's other publications were often
    fined and censored by King Louis-Philippe's officials, in fact the cartoons
    were so offensive that a single caricature depicting Louis-Philippe as 
    Gargantua  resulted in Daumier receiving a sentence of 6 months in prison. 
    The current lithograph was made at the outset of Daumier's long, prolific
    career, when he was just 23 years old.  Delteil 24.

    Lithograph on two  Chine appliqués , 1861.  564x444 mm; 22¼x17½ inches, full
    margins.  Préaud's first state B (of 2), with the "white bird" lower left
    and before the transfer to another stone in 1868.  Edition of approximately
    200 lifetime impressions.  Printed by Lemercier, Paris.  Signed and
    dedicated by the artist's daughter, Rodolphine Bresdin, in pencil, lower
    right.  A superb, richly-inked impression of this important lithograph with
    very strong contrasts and all the details distinct.  <br><br>Lifetime
    impressions, such as the current work, are exceedingly scarce.  There is
    also a more common, posthumous edition of approximately 800 impressions
    (printed after the transfer of the subject to another stone).<br><br>Despite
    his technically complex and highly imaginative printed work, the self-taught
    Bresdin (1822-1885) remained in obscurity and penniless throughout most of
    his career. Disregarded by many of his contemporaries due to his
    eccentricity, he was referred to as "le chien-caillou" ("the stone dog").
    Some critics and artists, however, recognized and respected his genius,
    including Victor Hugo and Charles Baudelaire (Bresdin was also Odilon
    Redon's mentor).<br><br>One of the most visionary printmakers since
    Rembrandt, he was clearly a devotee of the master's work, evidenced both in
    his early engravings and lithographs of intimate interior genre scenes and
    by a comparison of the current work.  Like Rembrandt's  The Angel Appearing
    to the Shepherds , etching, 1634, Bresdin's  tour-de-force  lithograph shows
    a dark landscape rendered by a complex system of densely overlapped lines
    and varied tonalities.  Van Gelder 100; Préaud 29.

    A very good, richly-inked impression of this scarce, early etching, with all
    the details distinct and with strong contrasts.<br><br>As Getscher notes in 
    The Stamp of Whistler , "Whistler was a very social animal," (see Oberlin,
    1977, page 13). His extrovert character was an important asset during his
    early years in Paris from 1855 to 1859.  Through his short training in the
    studio of Parisian artist Charles Gleyre (1806-1874), he met a group of
    local artists who helped him adapt to life in the new city.  His friendship
    with the artist Henri Fantin-Latour, which developed while they were copying
    paintings by the masters in the Louvre, led him into an artistic circle that
    included luminaries of French painting at the time such as Gustave Courbet
    (1819-1877), Carolus-Duran (1837-1917) and Édouard Manet (1832-1883). 
    Another associate of this group was the influential Parisian author and
    critic Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867), who was an early champion of
    Whistler's work.<br><br>Whistler also visited London frequently from 1855 to
    1858, mainly to see his half-sister Deborah, who had married the artist
    Francis Seymour Haden (1818-1910), and her family.  These visits provided
    the subjects for more of his etchings from this time and prepared the way
    for his move to London in 1859.<br><br>This still-life study, which stands
    alone in Whistler's etched  oeuvre , was made shortly after his return to
    London from Paris upon the completion of the "French Set" or  Douze
    eaux-fortes d'après Nature .  Whistler and his brother-in-law worked closely
    for several months during this time at the latter's house on Sloane Street,
    London, where Haden had installed his own etching press.  Kennedy 27;

    impressions of  Old Battersea Bridge  have been recorded, though not all
    have been located.  Whistler was expected to print 25 for the Fine Art
    Society, and Frederick Goulding (1842-1909) was to print the remaining 25. 
    However, Whistler had not completed the edition before he left for Venice in
    September 1879.  On his return from Venice he apparently started printing
    again, and sold 21 impressions to the Fine Art Society on 8 April 1881. 
    This actually suggests that Whistler decided to print them all himself."

    for printing, when he wrote to his London printer Thomas Way, "Take a fine
    proof of this and put it beside any one of the old lithographs out of your
    portfolio—and then see how this 'belle dame' looks fair and silvery, and
    beautiful in the  quality  of blacks! Indeed far and away more like the

    appears in several other lithographs drawn by Whistler in August/September
    1894 similarly at rest and casually posed, perhaps signaling the onset of
    her fatal illness which was diagnosed as cancer at the end of the year. Way

    Manet, exhibited in 1863 at the Galerie Martinet, Paris, and in 1867 at the
    temporary pavilion he erected on the avenue de l'Alma near the Exposition
    Universelle.  He subsequently cut the canvas into several fragments,
    evidently in response to the negative criticism it received.  The etching is
    the only record of the full composition of this now destroyed painting.

    poster to show both Jane Avril and Yvette Guilbert, the two Montmartre 
    demimondes  who were both his friends and major inspirations. Jane Avril,
    the star dancer at the Moulin Rouge, is in profile seated next to the
    literary critic, Édouard Dujardin. On stage in the background, Guilbert is
    depicted from the neck down, recognizable by her trademark long black
    gloves. The composition is arranged along the diagonal of the stage and the
    orchestra pit in the style of Japanese Ukiyo-e woodcuts that were so
    fashionable in Paris at the end of the 19th century and from which artists
    from the Impressionists to Gauguin and Van Gogh drew influence. Delteil 341;

    Color lithograph on cream wove paper mounted on linen, 1893.  1359x978 mm;
    53½x38½ inches (sheet), full margins.  First state (of 2).  Printed and
    published by Charles Verneau, Paris.  <br><br>Bruant was one of Lautrec's
    (1864-1901) earliest supporters.  One year after Lautrec designed his first
    poster for the Moulin Rouge, Bruant recognized the potential that such
    potent artwork could have for his own career.  The success of their first
    work (which Bruant had to force on the manager of the Ambassadeurs as he
    considered it too vulgar) led to many more commissions. This is Lautrec's
    third poster for the performer.  The broad strokes, flat colors, detailed
    representation of the singer's face, and the implied arrogance of the
    performer who would turn his back on his public all served to make this an

    Etching and drypoint, 1885.  400x254 mm; 15¾x10 inches, full margins.  A
    superb, richly-inked impression of this very scarce etching.<br><br>Though
    Wentworth notes that Tissot (1836-1902) announced this etching to be issued
    in an edition of 500, it seems that much fewer than the entire edition were
    actually printed.<br><br>We have found only 6 other impressions at auction
    in the past 30 years.<br><br>This etching is based on Tissot's same titled
    oil painting from 1883-85 now in the collection of the Musée d’art et
    d’histoire, Geneva.  According to Paquette, "Immediately after Tissot’s
    mistress and muse Kathleen Newton died of tuberculosis in November, 1882, he
    abandoned his St. John’s Wood [London] home and moved back to Paris, which
    he had left following the bloody aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War in
    1871.  During his eleven years in London, he had declined Edgar Degas’
    invitation to show his work with the artists who became known as the
    Impressionists.<br><br>Tissot exerted himself to re-establish his reputation
    in Paris with a series of fifteen large-scale pictures called  La Femme à
    Paris  (The Parisian Woman).  Painted between 1883 and 1885, they portrayed
    the fashionable  parisienne  in various incarnations using brighter, modern
    colors than he had in his previous work.<br><br>The pictures were exhibited
    at the Galerie Sedelmeyer, Paris, from April 19 to June 15, 1885, as “Quinze
    Tableaux sur la Femme à Paris,” and at Arthur Tooth and Sons, London, in
    1886 as “Pictures of Parisian Life by J.J. Tissot.”<br><br> La Femme à
    Paris  was poorly received.  A critic for  La Vie Parisienne  complained
    that the women in the series were “always the same Englishwoman”--some say
    the faces all resembled Kathleen Newton.   Another reviewer dismissed
    Tissot’s modern urban women as “gracious puppets.”  Some found both the
    poses and compositions awkward and disconcerting.<br><br>Tissot made
    etchings only of the first five of the paintings in the series, 
    L’Ambitieuse ,  Ces dames des chars ,  Sans dot ,  La Mystérieuse  and  La
    Plus jolie Femme de Paris , planning to sell sets to collectors, but they
    never were published.<br><br> La Plus jolie Femme de Paris , was to be
    written about by Edgar Degas’ old schoolmate, the playwright and novelist
    Ludovic Halévy.  In a story with that title later published, translated into
    English, the wife of a Parisian lawyer is determined to be the most
    beautiful woman in Paris--until the next day, when a musical comedy actress
    becomes the focus of the fickle public’s attention," Paquette, “Tissot’s La
    Femme à Paris series,” The Hammock, 2013.   Wentworth 81.

    between 1869 and 1912 she exhibited at 37 Salons in 44 years, though she
    predominantly focused on advancing her husband's career and caring for their
    four children.  Dubray  became interested in the teaching art, and achieved
    a reform in the way that drawing was taught, abandoning the linear method in
    favor of freer and more spontaneous processes.  In 1908 she organized an
    exhibition of women painters in Paris in the salons of the Lyceum. 
    Following a journey to India, she wrote in  Femina  in 1911 about the
    condition of women in Egypt and India.  From 1913 to 1921 Besnard was
    Director of the French Academy in Rome, and Dubray acted as a mentor and

    <br><br>Provenance: Albert de Belleroche (1864-1944), the artist and friend
    of Sargent, Southwell, Nottingham; thence by descent to William de
    Belleroche and Gordon Anderson, Brighton; private collection, New
    York.<br><br>Welsh-born artist Albert de Belleroche (1864-1944), credited as
    one of the greatest lithographers of the 20th century, was instrumental in
    Sargent's (1856-1925) foray into lithography.  The two met in Paris while
    both studying under Carolus-Duran (1837-1917) in 1882.  They created several
    portraits of each other; Sargent's 1883 oil on canvas portrait of
    Belleroche, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, remained in
    Sargent's possession throughout his life.  After Sargent moved to London
    following the  Madame X  scandal, he was introduced to lithography by
    Frederick Goulding, and no doubt encouraged by Belleroche.  When in 1905,
    Belleroche asked Sargent to draw his portrait on transfer paper with
    lithographic crayon to accompany an article in the  Gazette des Beaux-Arts ,
    Sargent liked the printed proofs from Paris so much so that he and
    Belleroche arranged for Beatrice Stewart to model for the present
    lithograph.  Dodgson 6.

    and photographs.  Moran made numerous sketches in watercolor and oil studies
    in Venice which he translated into large oil paintings once back in his New

    among American art patrons by also issuing deluxe editions of etchings, made

    streets of the Hamptons provided him with the vistas of contemporary life
    that he sought to capture without nostalgia, drenched in light and shadows.

    Hampton, the figure in the foreground, Uncle David Gardiner, was a local

    print.<br><br>Hassam (1859-1935) made more than 350 etchings; by comparison
    his lithographed  oeuvre  of fewer than 50 subjects was considerably
    smaller.  The technical complexity of producing lithographs might have been
    a determining factor.  He could produce etchings on his own in his studio,
    using minimal materials and with greater spontaneity; for lithography he
    worked alongside a lithographic printer, using more complicated printing
    supplies and proofing impressions at a printing workshop.<br><br>Hassam
    produced all of his 45 lithographs during the years 1917-18, working with
    the printer George Miller in New York.  Of these, five were lithotints, like
    the current work, drawn directly on the stone whereas the lithographs were
    drawn on transfer paper first and thereafter transferred to the printing
    stone.  Griffith 29.

    smoking his pipe." It seems that he struggled with the execution of this

    Lewis (1881-1962) moved to Sandy Hook, Connecticut, temporarily leaving New
    York, to help reduce the cost of living during the Depression years. 
    Residing outside of the city inspired Lewis to explore country life in his
    work.  During this several year hiatus from New York, he created 17 prints,
    many of which depict rural nocturnes as well as other local scenery, which
    enabled him to display his virtuoso mastery of tonal values.   Circus Night 
    depicts the arrival of Hunt's Three-Ring Circus to Sandy Hook.  McCarron

    From  Laurels Number Two .  A superb, evenly-printed
    impression.<br><br>Avery (1885-1965) was sometimes thought of as the
    "American Matisse."  His work never fully resembled that of his
    contemporaries, the Cubists or Surrealists, but his palette did.  His
    distinct modernism that eschewed both abstraction and realism is rather more
    closely related to the Color Field Abstract Expressionists (Mark Rothko,
    Adolph Gottlieb, Hans Hoffman and Barnet Newman), whose development he
    likely influenced, through the use of boldly juxtaposed colors in a flat
    planar style.  Many of the subjects within his work, and his prints in
    particular which first appear in 1933, are of close friends and family.  The
    domesticity of the quiet home and its inhabitants, such as his wife Sally in
    the present print, very much appealed to Avery.<br><br>Avery experimented
    with drypoint during the early 1930s, foregoing the use of color for which
    he is more commonly known, to explore the energy of the line through
    printmaking.  His first drypoint scratches were on zinc and copper plates
    acquired from the refuse scraps of a photoengraver; this accounts for the
    irregularly-sized plates in his early prints.  He proofed the plates roughly
    and sometimes set them aside until years later when they were printed in
    numbered editions.  Stanley W. Hayter's Atelier 17 printed  My Wife Sally

    Etching and drypoint, 1904.  463x377 mm; 18¼x14¾ inches, wide margins. 
    Edition of 250.  Van Gelder Zonen watermark.  Printed by Louis Fort, Paris. 
    Published by Vollard, Paris.  From  La Suite des Saltimbanques .  A superb,
    dark and evenly-printed impression of this early, important print, with
    strong contrasts.<br><br>The austerity and sentimentality of  Le Repas
    Frugal  is characteristic of Picasso's (1881-1973) Blue Period (1901-04). 
    During his Blue Period and into his Rose Period, so-called for the principal
    color palettes that he utilized in his paintings at the time, Picasso's art
    explored the experiences of those on the fringes of society and those in the
    poor, bohemian neighborhoods of Spain and Montmartre, Paris, where the
    artist resided in the early 1900s.  Picasso's budget was so limited that he
    purchased the plate for  Le Repas Frugal  second-hand (it had been a
    horizontal landscape etching)—the remnants of the previous etching can be
    seen in the foliage ghosting through the background in the upper right of
    the print.  After rudimentary instruction in the art of printmaking and
    having completed just one other print in 1899, Picasso executed this large,
    ambitious etching of an emaciated, meditative couple and their sparse meal.
    <br><br>During his Blue Period, Picasso utilized Mannerist techniques in his
    execution of figures; the elongated forms and compositional tension of
    Mannerism highlights the isolation and austerity of Picasso's subjects. 
    However, the flatness of the scene, the stylized facial features of the
    woman and the painstaking detail in the hands of the couple indicate that
    this is not a scene taken from life, but an allegorical scene constructed
    from the glimpses into the lives of those living in poverty.  This is the
    impact of the Symbolist aesthetic, which encouraged the evocation of
    emotions over realism and elevated quotidien scenes.<br><br>Though this
    plate was completed in 1904 and Picasso made some initial proofs, it wasn't
    published as an edition until 1913 when Picasso's then art dealer, Ambroise
    Vollard, purchased the plate and steel-faced it.  This print is part of the 
    La Suite des Saltimbanques , along with 11 drypoints and 2 additional
    etchings created by Picasso between 1904-06.  Bloch 1; Geiser 2.

    dell'Arte  motifs that Picasso had made in 1920 (see Zervos 82).  Picasso
    (1881-1973) worked closely with the professional pochoir printmakers to

    Edition of 260.  Signed in pencil, lower right.  Picasso watermark.  Printed
    by Lacourière, Paris.  Published by Vollard, Paris.  A superb, richly-inked
    impression.<br><br> Garçon et Dormeuse a la Chandelle  is one of 100
    different etchings from the Vollard Suite, a series Picasso (1881-1973)
    produced from 1930 to 1937 for Parisian publisher Ambroise Vollard.  While
    over 300 sets were printed, complete suites are exceedingly scarce, instead
    the prints from this series now are often found individually.<br><br>The
    suite spans Picasso's passionate, sometimes tumultuous affair with his
    teenage model and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter. Many of the earlier works in
    the series portray a sculptor in his studio among his work--alluding to the
    classical myth of Pygmalion.  The later prints become increasingly dark as
    both his relationship with Marie-Thérèse waned and Europe marched toward
    World War II.<br><br>This particular print marks a turning point in
    Picasso's relationship with Marie-Thérèse, as it was made when Picasso
    learned that she was pregnant with his child in 1934.  Her pregnancy marked
    the end of Picasso's then marriage to the Ballet Russe dancer Olga Koklova
    and also the beginning of the end for his relationship with his young model
    (just one year later he would meet Dora Maar--with whom Marie-Thérèse would
    become embattled over Picasso's affection).<br><br>This print, however,
    portrays a tranquil scene of a sleeping woman--Marie-Thérèse--her fertile
    feminine features illuminated by candlelight, with a young man (likely
    intended to symbolize Picasso himself) sitting and thoughtfully watching her
    at rest.  A single candle illuminating the scene creates a stillness and
    chiaroscuro reminiscent of Rembrandt's nocturnal scenes.<br><br>The onset of
    World War II and the sudden death of the publisher Vollard in a car crash in
    the south of France in 1939 delayed the distribution of this seminal suite,
    among the most important modern print series by a single artist, until the
    1950s.  Bloch 226; Geiser 440.

    authentication from Maya Widmaier Picasso, Paris, April 17, 1992,
    accompanies this lot.<br><br>Among Picasso’s (1881-1973) most expressive
    works are his  oeuvre  of lithographs, which allowed the artist to see his
    own evolution of technique and revise compositions fluidly, like drawings. 
    Though Picasso had produced a few lithographs in his early career, it was
    not until he began his partnership with the printers Mourlot Frères, Paris
    in November 1945 that the artist rediscovered the medium that he would
    re-invent at mid-century through his incessant experimentation and
    creativity.  Picasso would challenge the Mourlot printshop with his designs,
    which sometimes incorporated collage elements and even fingerprints. 
    However demanding, the collaboration would culminate in over 400 prints in
    20 years.  Picasso was in a state of constant revision and the majority of
    his lithographs have multiple states, some more than ten.  The progressions
    show Picasso’s creativity at play even with only the subtlest reworkings. 
    He would work for long stints at a time at his lithographs and he would
    eventually lay claim to a corner of the Mourlot workshop, a refuge from his
    own notoriety.  <br><br>The free and buildable nature of lithography allowed
    Picasso the liberty to explore ideas and follow them to fruition.  He
    remarked that, “The movement of my thought interests me more than the
    thought itself.”  This intimate family scene shows the artist's then
    partner, the artist Françoise Gilot (born 1921), resting on a sofa, while
    their two children, Claude (born 1947) and Paloma (born 1949), play with
    their toys on the floor.  Bloch 739; Mourlot 239; Reuße 625.

    crowds and traffic moving about Piccadilly Circus, a circular road junction
    and major public space bordered by stately buildings in London's West End. 
    At the far left, the artist depicted the dominant ediface of the County Fire
    Office (side view). Search lights illuminate the pitch black sky; Bone
    rendered the sky by drawing a dense network of lines to hold the ink. 
    Street lamps (particularly the tall one at right) cast light beams downward,
    as their tops were shaded to be in accordance with war regulations.  Visible
    in silhouette is the popular Shaftsbury Memorial Fountain, graced by the
    statue of Eros (or Anteros) by Alfred Gilbert.  When this print was first

  CROSSHEAD: ' Saint-Severin. '
  TYPESET: >-
    Lithograph, circa 1925.  565X423 mm; 22¼x18¼ inches, full margins.  Signed
    by the artist's widow, Sonia Delaunay, titled and numbered 52/75 in pencil,
    lower margin.<br><br>Delaunay (1885-1941) chose the view into the ambulatory
    of the Parisian Gothic church Saint-Séverin as the subject of his first
    series of groundbreaking modern paintings, from circa 1909, in which he
    charted the modulations of light streaming through the stained-glass windows
    and the resulting perceptual distortion of the architecture.  This
    lithograph is based on a painting from the series; like many of Delaunay's
    lithographs, only proofs were printed during his brief career, the majority
    were printed posthumously and authorized by his widow, the artist Sonia
    Delaunay (1885-1979).

    Edition of 200.  A very good, evenly-printed impression.<br><br>Duchamp
    (1887-1968) etched this print for  Du Cubisme  after the same-titled oil
    painting he had made in 1911 for his brother, sculptor Raymond
    Duchamp-Villon (1876-1918).  His brother was married in 1911 and had asked
    his artist friends to make him small paintings as wedding gifts with which
    to decorate their newlywed kitchen.<br><br>According to Duchamp's later
    recollection, "I made this old-fashioned coffee mill for him.  It shows the
    different facets of the coffee grinding operation and the handle on top is
    seen simultaneously in several positions as it revolves.  You can see the
    ground coffee in a heap under the cogwheels of the central shaft, which
    turns in the directions of the arrow on top" (d'Harnoncourt/McShine,  Marcel
    Duchamp , 1973, page 256).

    Berlin.  Published by Propyläen-Verlag, Berlin.  From  Das Vater Unser .  A
    very good impression.<br><br>According to the Museum of Modern Art, New
    York, where there is an uncolored impression of this woodcut, the subject of
    this work illustrates the line from the Lord's Prayer, "But deliver us from
    evil."  Pechstein's (1881-1955) portfolio  Das Vater Unser  (The Lord's
    Prayer) contains twelve different woodcuts.  "Promising forgiveness and
    deliverance from evil, the Lord's Prayer resonated powerfully in postwar
    German society, which was saddled with war guilt and reparations, beset by
    hunger, and racked by civil unrest and political violence.  Pechstein
    illustrated a single verse of the Lord's Prayer on each of this portfolio's
    twelve sheets, following the German translation from Martin Luther's  Small
    Catechism , which emphasizes the power of individual prayer.  Pechstein's
    woodcuts contrast God's grandeur and omnipotence with his humble followers'
    modest lives.  The artist clothed the faithful in the simple garb of Baltic
    fishermen, familiar to him from his repeated stays in Nidden on Prussia's
    easternmost border.  Their masklike faces and blocky, angular bodies combine
    the styles of medieval German woodcuts and forms sourced from the South
    Pacific, which Pechstein had visited before World War I, and from
    Africa.<br><br>Pechstein created the portfolio during a time of intense
    personal and social upheaval.  Only two years earlier, he had been an
    instrumental figure in revolutionary artists' organizations that had
    agitated for social reform in Germany's newly established democracy.  But
    like many others he quickly grew disillusioned, and, it seems, he began
    looking for change not through politics but through heavenly intervention."

    Published by Malik-Verlag, Berlin.  From  Im Schatten .  A very good
    impression of this scarce print.<br><br>Grosz's (1893-1959) portfolio  Im
    Schatten  (In the Shadows) focuses on the lives of Weimar Germany's
    forgotten citizens: the toiling proletariat and crippled veterans who
    enjoyed none of the glittering pleasures of the postwar metropolis.  Grosz
    presents the monotonous lives of the workers sympathetically, reserving his
    usual scathing caricature for fat capitalists, petit-bourgeois philistines
    and pompous army officers.  Workers, war invalids and impoverished mothers
    and widows go about their lives in tattered clothing with quiet dignity. 
    Grosz humanizes the workers, carefully giving each a unique physiognomy and
    gait, even as they head  en masse  to the factory.  The title of this work, 
    Ameisen  (or Ants), alludes to the monotonous routine of these men on their
    way to work.  Dückers MIV I.

    Printed by Louis Fort, Paris.  A superb, richly-inked impression of this
    very scarce, early etching.<br><br>Like many of Chagall's (1887-1985) prints
    from the early part of his career,  L'Apparition, I  (The Vision) is based
    on an oil painting which dates from 1917.   After Chagall moved to Paris in
    1923, he created new versions of many of the works he had made in Russia.  
    L'Apparition, I  depicts the young painter at his easel visited by an
    angel.  Chagall's paintings were often inspired by his dreams, and the
    winged angel is only one of many fabulous beings replete in his
    compositions.   Chagall recognized that through his art he could escape into
    his imagination.  He later said that painting, "Appeared to me like a window
    through which I could fly away toward another world."  Kornfeld 44.
