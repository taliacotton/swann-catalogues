  DESCRIPT: CLAUDE FAYETTE BRAGDON (1866-1946)
  CROSSHEAD: THE CHAP BOOK. Circa 1895.
  TYPESET: >-
    Bragdon, like many of the early Art Nouveau artists, was trained as an
    architect, but worked in all the fields of decorative arts. In all, he
    designed three posters for the <i>Chap Book</i> magazine, this being the
    last. Whereas Bragdon's first two posters are very turn-of-the-century in
    style, this one clearly heralds a new era in design, presaging Art Deco by
    almost 30 years. Although copies of this poster can be found in the Library
    of Congress and the University of Rochester library, it scarcely appears at
    auction and never with such strong, original color. <i>Rare</i>. DFP-I 184,

  DESCRIPT: FRANZ VON STÜCK (1863-1928)
  CROSSHEAD: INTERNATIONALE KUNST - AUSSTELLUNG / (SECESSION). Circa 1896.
  TYPESET: >-
    In 1893, Von Stück officially co-founded the Münich Secession movement, and
    used an image of the head of Athena on a poster advertising the group's
    first international exhibition. He had initially painted the image in 1891,
    and when he adapted it for use with the Secession movement, it was so well
    received that the image was used on subsequent posters to advertise the
    group's exhibitions, becoming their de facto emblem. It eventually appeared
    without its mosaic background, and we have found some variations from as
    late as 1921. Rademacher considers the image to be "the first modern
    artistic German poster" (Rademacher p. 58). This early version advertises
    the Munich Secession Exhibitions at the original Prinz-Regenten-Strasse
    address before they were moved to the Königsplatz around 1897-8. Another
    more commonly-seen version shows the new location, the
    Kunstausstellungsgebäude (opposite the Glyptotek), pictured on the bottom of
    the poster. This <i>rare</i> variant includes the tram directions and ticket
    prices on the Red Line to get to the exhibition. Wember 745, DFP-III 3213,

  CROSSHEAD: BERLINER TAGEBLATT. Circa 1899.
  TYPESET: >-
    Born in Galicia, Austria, and an art student in Germany, Lilien is
    considered "the first artist of the Zionist Movement . . . [he was] actively
    involved over a period of years with the Zionist Movement, and served as
    representative to the Sixth Zionist Congress. He was one of the founders of
    the Judischer Verlag, the Jewish publishing company in Berlin whose
    publications propagated the artistic and literary output of the Jewish
    Renaissance. He also took part in establishing the Bezalel School of Art in
    Jerusalem" (Haim Finkelstein, Lilien and Zionism,
    http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph3/articles_assaph3/11finkelstein.pdf).
    A master of Jugendstil design, Lilien was a book illustrator, etcher and
    graphic designer. He designed this poster for Rudolf Mosse, the publisher of
    the newspaper whose initials appear on the crest being held by the two
    central figures. An active participant in the Jewish artistic scene and
    Renaissance in Berlin between 1890-1918, Lilien was one of the Modernists
    celebrated in the exhibition <i>Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture,
    1890-1918</i> at the Jewish Museum in New York, 1999. This <i>rare</i>
    poster is a masterwork of Secession stylization and design. We have only
    found two other examples at auction in the last 20 years. DFP-III 2017.

  TYPESET: >-
    Rössler, primarily a Leipzig and Dresden-based specialist in decorative
    painting, and Klemm who worked in the same field, joined forces to create
    this Jugendstil image with Secessionist accents. The swirly border and
    typography are clearly Jugendstil. The central figure, although academically
    rendered and highly symbolic, is treated in a modern and daring way - in
    flashy orange, with a boldness and simplicity that bespeak Secessionist
    themes. DFP-III 2720, Kunst-Ereignisse cover and plate 20, Wember, p. 108.

  CROSSHEAD: WEITE WELT. 1901.
  TYPESET: >-
    Professor Joseph Popp, writing about <i>Pioneers of German Poster Art</i>
    for <i>Das Plakat's</i> September 1917 issue, explains that while Heine's
    style draws from "both Japanese art and the work of Aubrey Beardsley, that
    he developed his own style, which goes back and forth between naive and
    refined simplicity, while occasionally taking other directions, without
    having any specific role model" (<i>Das Plakat</i>, September 1, 1917 p.
    265). This pose of a reclining woman reading a magazine was somewhat of a
    graphic meme at the time, with similar tableaux appearing in <i>Pel &
    Ploma</i>, by Ramon Casas in 1899, and <i>Lesen Sie</i>, by Kolomon Moser in

  CROSSHEAD: '"CASTELL" / A.W. FABER. 1908.'
  TYPESET: >-
    In 1906, at the age of 23, Lucian Bernhard won a poster design competition
    sponsored by Priester matches. Ernst Growald, the director of the Berlin
    printing establishment Hollerbaum & Schmidt, recognized his talent and
    immediately hired Bernhard. The young artist quickly developed a graphic
    design system that proved to be revolutionary in the advertising world.
    Bernhard was the father of the Sachsplakat (Object Poster), a style in which
    the object is depicted in flat colors, with no ornamentation and no shadow,
    against a monochromatic background with very large, bold typography. This
    <i>rare</i> design for A.W. Faber pencils (the first brand name pencil)
    epitomizes this style.

    To promote the first International Import Fair held in Frankfurt after World
    War I, Hohlwein renders a spectacular nighttime scene. A train, dramatically
    seen from below, crosses a bridge and drops flyers that are, in fact, flags
    of the different countries participating in the fair. Hohlwein uses the
    white of the paper to make the text and several of the flyers ingeniously
    stand out from the dark coloration of the poster. This is the larger

    Riquet, purveyors of exotic chocolates and teas, was one of Hohlwein's
    biggest clients. In the many posters he designed for the firm, he would
    always strive to depict exotic images connected to the countries from which
    the products were imported. Here, against a sharp yellow background, in
    front of an unusual blue plant, he represents a statue of Buddha. The image
    is infused with drama thanks to the lighting that Hohlwein creates using his
    unique strokes-of-color treatment. <i>Rare</i>. Hohlwein / Stuttgart 188.

    Founded in 1905 by Hans Sachs (a dentist in Berlin), the Verein der Plakat
    Freunde (Association of Friends of the Poster) began publishing <i>Das

    through 1922 and its influence cannot be understated. Each issue is a
    treasure trove of information, and includes many color reproductions and
    tipped-in illustrations. Its publication was not continuous, and was
    slightly irregular, interrupted by the First World War, but we believe this
    to be one of the most complete sets of this leading and important journal.

  CROSSHEAD: '"PRIMAVERA" VEGLIONE DELLA FAMIGLIA ARTISTICA. 1898.'
  TYPESET: >-
    Born in Russia to German parents, Hohenstein studied art in Vienna before
    settling in Milan. He began working with Ricordi, the great Italian
    publishing company in 1889, designing sheet music covers for operas. Shortly
    thereafter, he became Art Director of the firm and began to design posters
    himself. Working for him at Ricordi were among the most famous Italian
    poster artists of the era, such as Dudovich, Mauzan and Metlicovitz, whose
    posters reflect Hohenstein's influence as one of the masters of the Golden
    Age of Italian posters, "from obvious stylistic floral influences of French
    Art Nouveau and the German Jugendstil" (Manifesti Italiano, p. 114).
    Hohenstein was invited to work outside of Italy, in France as well as
    Belgium, where he designed at least two posters printed by the Belgian
    printing house J.L. Goffart. The Liberty Style at the turn of the century
    was triumphant in Italy, while the fascination for posters had begun to wane
    in France. This playful image advertises one of the Milan Carnivals that
    were fashionable in the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth
    century, usually a week or so after the Venice Carnival in February or
    March. Many of these balls and celebrations were organized by municipal
    organizations or the "Milanese artistic family" - this one at the Teatro
    Lirico. A <i>rare</i> poster, in an unusual narrow format; another copy can

    Hohenstein designed this monumental and beautifully ornate poster for the
    <i>National Hygiene Exhibition</i> in Naples. Touting the benefits of fresh
    air and water, Hohenstein illustrates a "Fountain of Life," being enjoyed by
    a Classically-styled nude family, with a peacock at their side. Set off by
    gold ink background, florals and undulating decorative frames, the rich blue
    ink of the poster further emphasizes the element of water. The swirling
    lines separating the text from image are reminiscent of the artist's poster
    of the same year for <i>Monte Carlo / Tir Aux Pigeons</i> (see Swann sale
    2467, Lot 222). The small, later version of this large-scale poster was

    Morach trained as a schoolteacher before studying painting in Bern. He went
    on to study in Paris, Munich, Dresden and Berlin. Back in Switzerland, he
    joined the Dadaists, Janco, Arp and Picabia exhibiting in the group Das Neue
    Leben. In addition to his painting, he was also a pioneer of work for puppet
    theaters with Sophie Taeuber-Arp. He designed fewer than ten posters, each
    with a decidedly modernist approach. His sense of style, with its Art Deco,
    Cubist and Bauhaus influence, permeates his posters as well as his paintings
    and puppet design. L'Affiche Art Deco p. 274 (var).

    Baumberger was one of the most prolific Swiss poster artists, with well over
    200 designs to his credit. Beginning in 1917, he regularly worked for PKZ,
    during which time he became close friends with (and advisor to) Emil Huber,
    PKZ's advertising director. This poster is not only the best he produced for
    the company, but is also an icon in poster history. The tweed coat is
    rendered in near-photographic perfection to the point where you can
    practically feel the fabric. Baumberger took a completely new approach to
    advertising by ingeniously incorporating the poster's text into the image in
    the form of the label in the coat. With this poster, Baumberger cemented his
    role as master of the "Object Poster" (a title he earned four years earlier
    with a classic image of a top hat), and began the trend of "New Objectivity"
    within the Swiss school of Graphic Design. A sensation from the day it was
    issued, this image remains compelling and proves to be one of the finest PKZ
    posters. Avant Garde p. 114, Modern Poster 188, Weill 439, Realismes 19, The

  TYPESET: >-
    After designing images in a geometric Art Deco style (<i>Gaba</i>, 1927) and
    toying with Surrealism (<i>PKZ</i>, 1934), Stoecklin turned towards Neue
    Sachlichkeit, or the New Objectivity. In this style, not only were products
    rendered in a hyper-realistic manner, without abstraction or interpretation,
    but lithographic techniques were also used at an elevated and precise level,
    allowing for clearer, crisper printing than ever before. One of Stoecklin's
    earliest examples New Objectivity, in which he presents "ordinary, if
    overlooked, item[s] elevated to extraordinary status - the tetrode tube,
    which was used in high-frequency radios. The approach is both grandiose and
    humorous, and Stoecklin executes the design masterfully" (Crouse p. 61).

  TYPESET: >-
    Vsevolod Meyerhold was known as a prominent actor and director at his
    self-named theater in Moscow between 1923 and 1938. A visionary director who
    was revolutionary in his style, Meyerhold pioneered the concept of
    biomechanics: "Its purpose was to widen the emotional potential of a theater
    piece and express thoughts and ideas that could not be easily presented
    through the naturalistic theater of the period" (Wikipedia). In a collection
    of articles published in 1926 by the Meyerhold Theatre, Alexander Slonimsky
    wrote: "<i>The Forest</i> reflects the revolutionary upsurge at the
    beginning of the 1870s, and it is for this reason that Meyerhold chose to
    stage this play in particular. In it, the object of the satire is not the
    mercantile middle class as is usually the case with Ostrovsky, but the
    landowning gentry in decline after the abolition of serfdom"
    (https://monoskop.org/images/8/88/Braun_Edward_Meyerhold_A_Revolution_in_Theatre.pdf).
    Receiving much critical response and inspiring over 50 articles over the
    following months, "<i>The Forest</i> remained permanently in Meyerhold's
    repertoire for the next fourteen years, being performed over 1700 times"
    (ibid). Many of the broadsides used to promote plays at the theatre reflect
    avant-garde typographic influences which were prevalent in the Soviet Union
    during the 1920s and 30s. These posters were often designed by the same
    person who designed the sets and costumes for specific productions.  The
    designs of these letterpress posters are consistent with the constructivist
    ideals of the theatre; they feature letter forms without adornment and
    through letterpress printing emphasize the importance of each small piece of
    type. <i>Rare</i>.

    in the years before World War I and the large ball they hosted every year in
    order to raise money for their association was one of the highlights of the

    granddaughter of Alexander Pushkin, who lived her extravagant life with her
    partner Mikhail Larianov. A Diaghilev devotee, she dedicated most of her
    considerable artistic talents to stage and costume design. She worked for
    the most prestigious theaters, operas, and ballet companies, from
    Rimsky-Korsakov's revolutionary <i>Coq d'Or</i>, to her final creations for
    the Marquis de Cuevas Ballet, in 1948. Like avant-garde painter Mikhail
    Larionov in 1923, Gontcharova designed the poster for the artists' ball at
    Bullier in 1926. Using black, brown, and orange cut-outs, she built a
    graphically-complex, cubist-inspired design of what looks like two figures

  TYPESET: >-
    Sutnar, as Artistic Director of <i>Druzstevni Prace</i>, was responsible for
    the artistic design of this periodical, the covers of which are all like
    mini posters. Following Karel Teige's belief that "the cover was an
    advertisement for the book . . . and to make this desirable poster-like
    balance as strong an impact as possible [the artist must choose] primary
    colors and geometric shapes," Sutnar added his own elements of photomontage
    and typography to Teige's concept of cover design (Oxford, p. 59). His
    aesthetic helped to further promote Functionalist design into mainstream
    society. Among the artists whose work is featured in this lifestyle
    magazine, both written and visual, are Josef Sudek, Jaromir Funke, Alexander
    Hackenschmied, Karel Teige, Vladimir Krejcar, Le Corbusier, Man Ray, Max
    Ernst and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. These issues frequently appear bound together;
    it is <i>rare</i> to find them loose, as issued. This group includes eight

    Irsai, who also went by the name Pesach Ir-Shay, was a Hungarian poster
    artist, graphic designer and architect. He served as an officer in the
    Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War, though an injury ended his
    original career as a violinist. He went on to start a career in architecture
    and graphic design, gaining knowledge about lithography through his work at
    Globus Printing House. Upon moving to Israel in 1952, he furthered his
    entrée into the graphic world, developing the first modern Hebrew font, the
    “Haim," and establishing himself in the world of theater and stage design.
    Later returning to Hungary, Irsai held onto Modernist styles of graphics and
    typography for many years, this image being one of a few commercial designs
    for Lampart. Other corporate commissions were created for companies such as
    Tungsum, Modiano and Nor-coc. During WWII, Irsai was able to escape the
    concentration camps and settled in Israel via Switzerland.

    In 1925, Lucian Bernhard emigrated to the United States - not for political
    reasons, but to explore new business opportunities in America. He left his
    studio in Berlin to his partner Fritz Rosen, who ran the company until 1933
    when he too emigrated to America. In 1929, Bernhard and Rosen had a large
    retrospective exhibition in Berlin; to advertise the show, they not only
    co-designed this poster, but also a cover for the magazine
    <i>Gebrauchsgraphik</i> (picturing the two of themselves with globes instead
    of heads - Bernhard's being the larger of the two). Their collaborative
    effort on the poster resulted in this intriguing, well-balanced "look and
    listen" image, playing stylistically on light and complementary colors. Half
    blue, half orange, half awake, half asleep, listening closely on one side,
    and peering attentively on the other, the two men capture the split
    personality of their working relationship while accentuating the common
    goals they strive to achieve. Germany p. 76, Verfuhrungen 130, Crouse p.

    design. A professor in the field during the Weimar period, Böhm traveled as
    a lecturer and produced designs for wallpaper, fabrics, pottery, typography
    and most notably, stamps. Although this poster for a Carnival evening
    promotes an appearance by Edith Heinemann, the master violinist, Böhm
    instead chose to illustrate a stylized masked harlequin. Heinemann, more
    widely known by her maiden name Lorand, was a Berlin-based violin virtuoso
    from a Hungarian-Jewish family, whose 20-year career on the Viennese stage
    endeared her with the titles of "Queen of the Waltz" and the "Female John
    Strauss" prior to her flight from Nazi Germany in 1937.

    Launched in 1924, construction problems delayed the maiden voyage of the
    <i>Statendam</i> until April 11, 1929. Known as the "Queen of the Spotless
    Fleet," she served the Holland-America Line until 1940, when she was
    destroyed during World War II. To promote her first crossing, Cassandre
    developed this compelling close-up view of funnels and ventilation cowls,
    with stylized waves of smoke billowing out overhead. Cassandre's love of sea
    travel found him "constantly renewing himself, constantly varying not only
    his point of view and angle but also his style" (Mouron p. 64). This poster
    not only represents another unique vantage point from which to view
    technology, but is "a prime example of Cassandre's attention to tonal
    values. The color scheme . . . brings a wonderfully sober equilibrium to the
    composition" (ibid. p.66). Mouron 104, Brown & Reinhold pl. 12, Cassandre /

  CROSSHEAD: L.M.S. BEST WAY. 1928.
  TYPESET: >-
    "In terms of its image and the energy it connotes, <i>L.M.S. Bestway</i> is
    Cassandre's most powerful poster" (Brown & Reinhold p. 14). In 1927,
    Cassandre painted an image very similar to this one for the <i>Nord
    Express</i> railway, which actually ended up rejecting the design. In 1928,
    Cassandre designed his first poster for the L.M.S. British railway line. He
    followed that poster with this one, a reconfiguration of his earlier
    painting. Printed in England, the poster conforms to the standard "quad
    royal" measurements for British Railway posters of the time. However, by all
    accounts, this poster was not used commercially, as only 50 copies were
    printed. "By changing to the unusual nearly square format, he evokes a
    feeling of vertical and horizontal compression of energy about to be
    unleashed . . . [by] creating an artful cacophony of light, shading, and
    geometric forms, he is able to emphasize the kinetic and dynamic aspects of
    a train in motion" (ibid). "It is a superb Cubistic painting . . . the

    Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, where he danced until 1956, with a short absence
    after WWII. After retiring as a dancer, he choreographed and staged ballets
    for various European companies. Many of his ballets were drawn from biblical
    or mythological themes, and this costume design here, titled "Andros"
    coincides with this period of his work.

  CROSSHEAD: S.T.A.R.N. AUTOBUS. 1929.
  TYPESET: >-
    Fix-Masseau spent some time working as an assistant to Cassandre. It is
    unclear whether the young artist got the commission to design this poster
    through Cassandre's atelier, or after he left and opened his own studio. In
    the latter case, this poster would be Fix-Masseau's first personal
    commission. The Chemins de Fer du Nord, for whom Cassandre designed his best
    railway posters, also had a network of buses connected to their train routes
    to reach smaller towns. Conceptually, Fix-Masseau designed this poster
    following Cassandre's guidelines, apparent in the grouping of the typography
    at the top and bottom of the image, and the perspective of the vehicles.
    Stylistically, Fix-Masseau clearly differs from Cassandre, in that his
    machines are less geometric and bear a more delicate illustrator's touch.

    Falcucci's career spanned multiple decades and several thematic milieus. He
    began designing car racing posters for the Monaco Grand Prix in 1930, and
    went on to design travel posters and images for Air France. His later work
    is punctuated by bright, near fluorescent colors. Here, he uses a simple
    primary color scheme and stylized map to show the many routes by which
    Algeria is accessible from France and other parts of Europe. To emphasize
    the speed used to make the trip, he portrays two steaming vehicles cruising
    powerfully toward their destinations.

    Bénézit goes on to praise Orsi's sense of simplification, his bright colors
    and his creative ideas, and further estimates that Orsi designed as many as
    1,000 posters. Despite this prodigious output, nothing else has been written
    on the artist and no portrait of him exists. Philips was one of his primary
    clients. Here, the Pointillist effect he creates to advertise a fluorescent
    light bulb is a classic example of the extent of his talent. The diagonal of
    the bulb itself, the unique handling of the coloring, the typography and the
    overall feeling of fluorescence make this an exceptional image.

  CROSSHEAD: CAILLER / CHOCOLAT AU LAIT. 1921.
  TYPESET: >-
    After studying in Lyon, Loupot fought in the First World War and was
    wounded. He returned from the front and settled in Lausanne, where his
    parents were living, and quickly began his successful career as a poster
    designer. Most of his work was for the fashion and luxury goods industries.
    His style, a combination of the high-profile Swiss School and his own light
    French touch, worked very well for the products he was asked to advertise.
    This poster epitomizes the sophistication that was his visual calling card.
    The elegant young woman, who has pulled a chocolate bar out of her bag,
    almost appears to be guiltily sneaking her indulgence. She is dressed in
    warm colors against a dark background, and through Loupot's unique handling
    of lithography, he has made the image and the typography appear to vibrate.

  CROSSHEAD: ST RAPHAËL / QUINQUINA. 1938.
  TYPESET: >-
    As Zagrodski notes in his book, Loupot's work for St. Raphaël "can be
    qualified as the work of his life." From 1937-1960 Loupot worked hand in
    hand with Max Augier, the advertising director of St. Raphaël, creating a
    series of posters that tell of a unique saga in the story of advertising.
    Working with the stylization of red and white-clad waiters, Loupot gradually
    moved towards creating more and more abstracted images. This is one of the
    earliest posters he designed for the company. It is also one of the first
    appearances of the company's name in a cursive script rather than block
    letters. Loupot 86, Loupot / Zagrodski 106, Reina Sofia p. 134.

  TYPESET: >-
    Duncan yo-yos hit the market in 1929 and quickly became an international
    sensation. Gid's design, using only two colors, encapsulates the sheer joy
    of the toy through three intricate characters that are not only playing with
    yo-yos, but are embodiments of the toy itself. Their heads, each with one
    large eye, resemble yo-yos, and even the letters seem to dance. A clever
    mixture of Art Deco and humor. Raymond Gid 24, Encyclopedie de l'Affiche p.

    he designed a series of posters promoting many of the Spanish dancers and
    performers in Paris. While most of these commissions were for second-rate
    acts, Madrazo brought a first-rate style to his work. All of his posters
    reflect his immediately recognizable personal style, in which he elongates
    his subjects into virtual ribbons and elastic bands, creating swirling

  CROSSHEAD: EXPOSITION ETHNOGRAPHIQUE DES COLONIES. 1931.
  TYPESET: >-
    Although he was active as a poster designer throughout his life, Gid is best
    known as a book designer and a master French typographer. In 1930, he wound
    up in North America on an ethnographic mission to study Canadian Indians.
    Through the connection he established with the Ethnographic Museum, he was
    asked to design this poster. The museum, located at the Trocadero, was
    closed for renovations in 1930, in order to refurbish it before a grand
    reopening a year later for a major colonial exhibition. Paul Colin designed
    a famous image to announce the event (see Swann Sale 2079, lot 37). This
    poster by Gid is for the first exhibition dedicated to the French colonies.
    The Oceanian idol and the typography are cleverly tilted to catch the eye in
    a pure Art Deco layout. This poster is a rare and early document pertaining
    to tribal arts exhibitions, a field that reached its pinnacle 75 years after
    this poster was designed with the opening of Paris' Quai Branly Museum. Gid

    Though not widely known by name, Dwiggins literally coined the term "Graphic
    Design" in 1922 to describe his process of book design as a melding of
    typesetting, illustration and design. A creative virtuoso, Dwiggins worked
    on projects ranging from typography, painting, puppetry and furniture to
    kite design, but was most prominent in the publishing and print world. Known
    in close circles as "WAD," he established the style of publisher Alfred A.
    Knopf's books, and developed at least a dozen typefaces including Caledonia
    and Electra. Dwiggins created the original logotype for General Motors, and
    worked for publications such as <i>Life</i> and <i>Harper's</i>. He also
    served as director of the Harvard University Press, and founded the Society
    of Calligraphers in Boston. He designed this and one other poster for the
    same exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. <i>Rare</i>. The Met

  CROSSHEAD: RURAL ELECTRIFICATION ADMINISTRATION. 1937.
  TYPESET: >-
    One of the greatest American posters of the 20th Century, Beall's
    optimistic, patriotic and progressive image is a monumental work whose
    aesthetic simplicity masks a complex design that reveals "the artist's
    distinctly American counterpart to European modernism" (Mechanical Age p.
    174). In fact, in many ways this image can be seen as the American version
    of El Lissitsky's <i>Russische Ausstellung</i> (see Swann Sale 2039, lot
    77), with the boy and the girl gazing hopefully and happily into their
    future. "The image speaks for itself in this almost-textless photomontage, a
    brilliant combination of realism and abstraction. These are 'poster
    children' for the REA - happy beneficiaries of the program, in the present
    and the future . . . The flag motif serves several purposes. It signifies
    the overarching protection of the New Deal; the 'matched' white stripes and
    fence rails subtly reinforce the connection between America and the farm;
    and it provides further visual interest, as the band of blue below the
    stripes somehow still functions as sky." Beall 114, Mechanical Age pl. 58,

  CROSSHEAD: GENERAL MOTOR AT THE NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR. 1939.
  TYPESET: >-
    A <i>rare</i> poster for the most popular exhibit at the New York World's
    Fair in 1939: General Motors' Futurama. The entire General Motors "Highways
    and Horizons exhibit occupied a seven-acre site on the Avenue of
    Transportation" (World of Tomorrow p. 108). The Futurama itself was a
    detailed model of America in the future (the world in 1960, a distant 20
    years from the time of the fair), over and around which visitors were
    whisked while sitting in sound chairs on a carry-go-round. Looking down on
    the model, visitors listened to a narrator explain all that they were
    seeing. The exhibition, "designed by Norman Bel Geddes, covers more than
    35,000 square feet and contains 500,000 individually designed houses and
    buildings and over 1,000,000 trees and shrubs of 18 species and 50,000 scale
    model vehicles" (General Motors Exhibit Building / New York World's Fair,
    1939, brochure). The ride, which covered countryside, highways and future
    cities, ended up with visitors actually standing in a full-scale street
    intersection of the future. "It was all brilliantly conceived-a
    magnificently entertaining journey into the future by hundreds of thousands
    of consumers-only to be dropped off onto a '1960' stage set filled with the
    gleaming, streamlined [General Motors] products of 1939 just waiting to be
    bought" (World of Tomorrow p. 111).

  CROSSHEAD: EUROPE / UNITED STATES LINES. Circa 1952.
  TYPESET: >-
    In the 1930s, after a traditional education in Chicago, Lester Beall became
    interested in avant-garde typography and the design elements of the Bauhaus.
    He moved to New York in 1935, where he began a successful career as an art
    director. He created world-acclaimed logos and corporate identities for such
    companies as American International Paper, Merrill Lynch, Caterpillar,
    Martin Marietta and the New York Hilton. His goal was always to get his
    clients out of what he called "the vast anonymity." He strove to achieve
    this goal with graphics as simple, efficient and readable as possible, as
    exemplified here with the S.S. United States in the middle of a
    patriotically-colored arrow pointing toward the word "Europe." Beall p. 73.

    with a contemporary dynamic vision.

  DESCRIPT: BEN SHAHN (1898-1969)
  CROSSHEAD: A GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND. 1948.
  TYPESET: >-
    <i>A Good Man is Hard to Find</i> is not a traditional campaign poster; it
    is more of a political cartoon or caricature, touting neither of the men
    depicted, but rather the unseen third Progressive Party candidate. "His
    intent was to present the two major parties as indistinguishable, with only
    the Progressive Party offering the voters a bid for change" (Prescott p.
    133). "The two candidates [Dewey and Truman], on whom Shahn obviously looked
    with equal suspicion, are ingeniously placed, Dewey atop a piano and Truman
    at its keyboard, before sheets of music whose titles are a vital part of the
    artist's satirical message . . . Details are handled with remarkable
    acuteness: the strained cordiality of Dewey's smile . . . the wrinkles in
    Truman's trousers and the amateurish flourish with which his right hand
    strikes a chord; the definition of both candidates' feet. Yet distortions
    and elisions are just as important, as in the aggrandizement of the two
    politicians' heads and the subtle way in which Truman's eyeglasses are left
    blank and the teeth of both men are frozen in bright evenness. This is an
    image intended to provoke laughter regardless of one's political
    convictions" (Soby, Graphic Arts, p. 17). Prescott p. 158, Images of an Era

  CROSSHEAD: KNOLL. 1948.
  TYPESET: >-
    After establishing himself as a successful designer and photographer both in
    his native Switzerland and in the commercial world of New York City, Matter
    was hired by upstart furniture company Knoll as their primary graphic design
    consultant in 1946. Integrating varied artistic influences with his
    experience in photomontage, typography and commercial photography, Matter
    produced many stand-alone posters for Knoll during his 20-year tenure with
    the company. Unlike many of his other posters that feature specific
    furniture items, this small poster contains only the abstract suggestion of
    furniture in its geometric patterning, crediting the power of the brand's
    name with the saleable information. "His work applied the principles of
    modernism to commercial design and helped define the postwar aesthetic in
    the United States, and he counted as friends or collaborators such artists
    as Alexander Calder, Alberto Giacometti, Willem de Kooning, and Jackson
    Pollock" (Guggenheim). Concurrently with his work at Knoll, Matter took on
    design and promotional projects with the Boston Museum of Art and the
    Guggenheim, perpetually fueling his designs with the evolving nature of
    modern art.

    yet spiritual. Mathematical, but still feeling" (Graphis 135, vol 24, p.
    10). "It was after a trip to Europe on which he had been impressed by the
    civic graphics of Zurich and other cities that John Massey conceived the
    idea of a planned civic graphics programme for Chicago . . . America's first
    civic cultural communications programme seeks to express through graphic
    design the virtues and diversity of the city's cultural life" (ibid. p. 14).

  CROSSHEAD: 3 CORSA AUTOMOBILISTIC CUNEO. 1927.
  TYPESET: >-
    Lucio Venna was a painter and poster designer who joined the Futurist
    movement towards the end of the First World War. By the early 1920s, he
    abandoned painting and began to focus exclusively on posters designed in his
    characteristic style "with evident futurist geometries" (Bolaffi p. 119).
    This poster advertises a race in Cuneo, but "the racecourse itself actually
    ran through the Maddalena Pass, which connects the Maritime Alps with the
    Cottian Alps and Cuneo with Barcelonette, France. The design perfectly
    represents the varied topography of the Italian city, which is located in a
    tree-lined valley at the base of the mountains. The Stura di Demonte river

    Garretto employs two established visual techniques to help convey his
    message; the advertised car has passed out of the frame, leaving only tire
    tracks and a plume of smoke behind. Yet, clearly it was such a car that it
    caught the eye and the attention of a trendy and handsomely dressed couple,
    who stand on the street corner looking after it. For the rest of us who were
    too slow to see it, there happens to be a poster within the poster depicting
    the car (ingeniously posted over other posters, whose corners are visible).
    Garretto was primarily a political cartoonist who became an international
    artistic star in the 1920s. He also received large commissions from American
    magazines like <i>Vanity Fair</i>, and began spending three or four months
    every year in the States.

    Race"). He was an official war artist during World War II. The artist's
    design choice to extend the flag pole past the image, through to the bottom
    of the poster, sets the viewer right next to the track, with just a slightly

  CROSSHEAD: ROLEX OYSTER PERPETUAL / RADIUM DIALS. Circa 1942.
  TYPESET: >-
    Rolex's original patent for their "Error Proof Radium dials," which became
    known (in the 1980s) as the 'California Dial,' was granted on June 15, 1942.
    Ironically their proof-reading was not error-proof, as the word 'Radium' is
    misspelled here where it first appears. The design of the face of the
    bubble-back watch features a combination of bold Arabic and Roman numerals.
    The patent states, "that this particular arrangement will give a clear view
    of the hours, will be easy to create with luminous materials, and will allow
    easy reading of the time – especially within wristwatch cases, where the
    dials are relatively small." The dial is a significant milestone in Rolex
    history, as it became the basis for the dials on the company's Submariner,
    SEA-DWELLER and GMT Master watches. Rolex purists have also pointed out the
    unusual crown logo on this poster. Rolex ceased use of radium in 1963, due
    to the cancer-causing nature of the element. <i>Rare.</i>

    Tourisme motorcycle takes to the lemon-yellow sky, freed from the shackles
    of gravity, taking chunks of the mountain with it as it rises to new

    appointed the "Official War Poster Designer" at the War Office, in which
    capacity he created more than 100 posters, and became the key person for
    British war communication. This image followed Games' controversial 1941
    poster for the ATS  [Auxiliary Territorial  Service], which featured a
    "blonde bombshell" - an image considered to racy to be used on that original
    poster. Not in Games.

    During the war, Games used photography and surrealism to create dramatic

    and 1943 that was intended to help prevent accidents. When the poster was
    reproduced in the <i>World Press News</i> in November 1943, it was noted
    that even small, and in black and white, the image "conveys an
    extraordinarily powerful impression" (Games p. 53). Games p. 57.

  TYPESET: >-
    Born in Germany, Reiss and his family emigrated to Britain in 1937, where he
    went on to become a prominent graphic designer. By the late-1940s and
    early-1950s, he was one of the most prolific British poster designers. His
    major clients were the General Post Office and the Post Office Savings Bank,
    but he also worked for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents.
    Reiss' posters are always cleanly designed and easy to understand, often
    composed of simple drawings with a photomontage or photographed elements,
    plus a touch of humor. In that humorous vein, comes his image, where a
    traveler has a propellor for a hat and his body is a contorted route map,
    visually suggesting that with air travel, distant parts of the world get
    closer.

  CROSSHEAD: FLY TO BRITAIN BY B.O.A.C. 1949.
  TYPESET: >-
    In post-war Britain, competition between the different airlines was fierce,
    and so, the airline companies hired the best graphic designers in the field,
    such as F.K. Henrion, Ashley Havinden and Abram Games, to help them
    advertise. At the time when Games was creating a series of posters for
    B.O.A.C., the trend among artists was not to illustrate the actual airplanes
    (as had been the style in the thirties), but instead to advertise the
    advantages of flying, such as saved travel time. In order to capture these
    concepts, the designers created beautiful, symbolic and
    surrealistically-inspired images that quite poetically captured the abstract
    concepts they were advertising. Here, Games literally folds the map,
    narrowing the span of the Atlantic and ensuring a much quicker flight to
    Britain on the Speedbird. Another text variant says "Fly the Atlantic by
    B.O.A.C." (See Swann sale 2510, Lot 156). Games fig. 125, IPA 51 no. 54.

    depicts the <i>USS Nautilus</i>, one of the country's first nuclear powered
    submarines. "It was an indelible logo in its day. Set against a graduated

    progress poised to help the world"

    Heiniger was an accomplished artist, designer, photographer and

    general Swiss public, he accomplishes efficient information delivery by
    using a photomontage and an arrow to delineate where a person should speak
    so they can be heard clearly on the other end. He designed a number of
    posters, including several others promoting the use of telephones, each with
    a pronounced photographic element. "The large lettering is hand drawn, the
    telephone set and the face are separate photographs montaged together. This
    technique was the forerunner of Müller-Brockmann's photographic road safety
    posters who owes a great deal to Heiniger" (Swiss Graphic Design p. 192).

    rebus, which has become one of the most famous and recognizable corporate
    identity statements of the 20th century. It took a year for the company to
    actually use the design in promotion, at which point they printed it as a

  TYPESET: >-
    This portfolio of playful typographic designs features the award-winning
    typefaces of the 1966 International Typeface Design Competition. Best known
    for his illustrative typography - and his work with the magazines <i>Avant
    Garde</i>, <i>Fact</i> and <i>Eros</i>, Lubalin was a prolific designer of
    advertisements, typeface, posters, logos and more. His trademark for
    <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> was used for several years, and also designed
    the trademark for the World Trade Center when it was founded. Not satisfied
    with the prevailing “Swiss Style” of design, he was keen to create a style
    that Americans would react to, called “graphic expressionism” – using
    typography to illustrate ideas. Typefaces created by Lubalin include ITC
    Avant Garde, Pistilli Roman, Lubalin Graph and Ronda. Includes duplicates.

    The Shamir brothers were born in Latvia, then studied graphics and design in
    Berlin, and in 1935, set up a studio, the "Shamir Brothers," in Tel Aviv. 
    One of their most iconic commissions was the design of the State of Israel
    Coat of Arms in 1949. This psychedelic blacklight poster was clearly
    influenced by the design aesthetic of the American rock and roll posters of
    the era, but the prominent "Lee" label on the Grandson's jeans suggests that
    this may be an advertisement for the clothing company.

    Declaration of Independence, based on the calligraphy style from a 16th
    century Torah scroll. Wallish also had his hand in designs for Israeli
    stamps, coins, banknotes and medallions, as well as many posters.

  TYPESET: >-
    For the seminal exhibition of 20th century posters from the Museum of Modern
    Art's own collection, curator Mildred Constantine assembled what Rita Reif
    referred to as "a landmark presentation that helped define the medium for
    scholars, graphics specialists and collectors" (<i>New York Times</i>, June
    26, 1988). The exhibition focused as much on contemporary images as
    historical ones, and the curators put extra emphasis on the contemporary
    state of graphic design by choosing Tadanori Yokoo to design the exhibition
    poster. For this golden opportunity, he created a very synthetic image with
    no typography within the image to distract the viewer. Using mouths and one
    large eye, he perfectly evokes the concept of "word" and "image." He employs
    the rays of the rising sun, one of his favorite and recurring motifs, but
    here, makes the colors red, white and blue for America rather than the
    Japanese red and white. Yokoo 546.

    With a traditional artistic background in textile design, Tanaka ultimately
    switched to graphic design. From book to logo design, interior decoration,
    typography and exhibition design, he practiced every aspect of the field
    with a refined style. For years, he also worked for the Seibu group, for
    whom he supervised their global image. A lover of traditional Japan, his
    posters celebrated the arts and crafts of his native country in a superb,
    modern way. For the Nihon Buyo (Japanese dance) performance at UCLA, Tanaka
    depicts a dancer's face, as if composed of origami. This is the first time
    he used this emblematic form, and he went on to employ it frequently in
    different variations for other posters he designed for cultural events and
    exhibitions.

  DESCRIPT: GÜNTHER KIESER (1930- )
  CROSSHEAD: AMERICAN FOLK BLUES FESTIVAL. Group of 5 posters.
  TYPESET: >-
    Kieser essentially dedicated his entire career to posters promoting jazz and
    blues concerts. He has designed hundreds of posters, the most memorable of
    which are images of three-dimensional tableaux that he constructed using
    diverse objects that caught his inspirational attention. He was also a major
    proponent of graphic découpage, in which he brought various images together
    to help form a cohesive message. The first image he designed for the Hamburg
    Folk Blues Festival was in 1968; the guitar at the center of the image is
    covered with "American" objects and photographs. He would continue to use
    the guitar in his subsequent posters for the event (in each case adorned
    differently), so much so that it became an immediately recognizable logo.
    Includes one duplicate. Images available upon request.

  CROSSHEAD: NO VIETNAMESE EVER CALLED ME NIGGER. 1968.
  TYPESET: >-
    A striking poster created to promote David Loeb Weiss' film <i>No Vietnamese
    Ever Called Me Nigger</i>, which won the award for Best Documentary at the
    Mannheim Film Festival in 1968. The title refers to a quote often
    misattributed to Muhammad Ali. It was a popular rallying cry during
    anti-Vietnam War demonstrations at the time, and can be seen in the film on
    the placards carried by protesters in the 1967 Harlem Fall Mobilization
    March. This event was the racially and politically-charged focus of the
    documentary, composed of footage of the march itself interspersed with
    interviews from protesters and Black Vietnam veterans. The result was a
    shockingly frank firsthand report, which a review in Open City called "the
    strongest statement yet from the Black community . . . a startling cry of
    rage and despair . . . As a study on why there is rebellion in the streets
    of Black America it is more succinct and illuminating than any government
    report can ever be." Glaser p. 95.

    up designing a series of highly stylized pop images for the publication.
    This one, which was used as the cover for issue 4, was also published as a

    Guggenheim Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, as well as teaching

    Giacometti's elongated figure, which runs straight up through the center of
    the image. The use of non-Helvetica typography seems to be an intentional
