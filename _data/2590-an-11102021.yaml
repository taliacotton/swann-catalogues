  TYPESET: "Bronze with brown patina, conceived in 1907. This is one of nine castings. 203x158x191 mm; 8x6¼x7½ inches. <br><br>Provenance: Kathleen Esther Garman, (Lady Epstein); \tEdward P. Schinman; Private collection, by descent from above; Martin Diamond Fine Arts Inc, NY; Private collection, acquired from above January 10, 1978. <br><br>Exhibited: The Jewish Museum, NY, <i>The Immigrant Generations: Jewish Artists in Britain 1900-1945</i>, May - October 1983. <br><br>The subject of this bronze is Romily John (1906-1986), son of artist Augustus John (1878-1961).  Jacob Epstein was born in America but moved to France at a young age to study art.  In 1905 he left Paris and settled in London where he met and befriended Augustus John.  This bronze was a commission by John. Epstein created two other known variations on this subject. You can see, in the simplification of the facial features as well as the smooth abstracted cap, the begining of Epstein's exploration of modernist forms."

    artist; Private collection. <br><br>After retiring from his government job
    as a financial officer in the Supply and Maintenance Agency of the U.S.
    Army, Thompson embarked on his art career. His studies began while working
    in Paris. At that time, he worked in an academic setting under André Lhote,
    creating still life and figurative works.  Finding his own paths of
    exploration, Thompson began painting within a range of gray tones. <br>Upon
    his retirement, Thompson returned to Washington, DC where he studied, then
    taught at the Corcoran School of Art. His works from 1967 until 1969 were
    abstractions in repetitious forms assembled on a grid and working in black
    and white. In 1971 he introduced color. The mature works of Elliott Thompson
    are focused on pattern and repetition.  They have a flowing tranquility that
    can be compared to the emotional ranges of music, with the repeating
    patterns as the rhythm, and the color range that of the melodic voice of
    each instrument. <br>Thompson's work has been exhibited with Gene Davis,
    Alma Thomas, Sam Gilliam, and other DC Color Field painters at important
    galleries including the Jefferson Place Gallery and the Barbara Fiedler
    Gallery as well as institutions such as The Corcoran Gallery of Art, The
    Ringling Museum of Art, and The Phillips Collection. His works are held by
    private and museum collections, including the Smithsonian American Art
    Museum. In 1974 The Corcoran Gallery of Art held a retrospective honoring
    the artistic contributions of Elliott Thompson.
