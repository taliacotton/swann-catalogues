    Frontispiece illustration published in Chapter II, Book the Third, of
    Charles Dickens's <i>A Tale of Two Cities.</i> Works of Charles Dickens,
    Household Edition. 55 vols. Illustrated by F. O. C. Darley and John Gilbert
    (New York: Sheldon and Co., 1863). Graphite, ink, and sepia on stiff paper.
    13x11 inches on 17x14-inch sheet. Signed "F.O.C. Darley, fecit" in lower
    left image.<br><br>The image refers to the scene from Dickens's classic
    novel in which the mob at Saint Antoine, reacting to the breakdown of civil
    authority in the midst of the September Massacres, sharpens its weapons in
    the courtyard of Tellson's Bank, Paris. The passage is: "Shouldering one
    another to get next at the sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist,
    with the stain all over their limbs and bodies." An observation of the image
    by Victorian scholar Philip V. Allingham notes that Darley lends the figures
    a more noble tone, rather than depicting the raw savagery of the author's
    words (victorianweb.org).

    A proposed but unfinished work intended for the set of limited-edition

    10½x8½ inches, on 14½x11½-inch sheet. Initialed "EG" in lower right corner.
    Taped to the lower right margin is a 1½x2¼-inch swatch of paper containing a
    penciled grid. Within it, Gorey worked out a cross design for one of the
    intricate wallpaper backgrounds in the drawing.<br><br><i>Signals</i>began
    as a catalogue that featured items related to PBS shows and carried a large
    amount of Gorey-related material over the years. Beginning in 1992, Gorey
    produced a series of ten limited edition offset lithographs exclusively for
    the catalog. Each of the ten prints in the series featured highly detailed
    scenes filled with imaginative Gorey characters and locations. For this
    piece, Gorey shows the interior and exterior of a three-story home using a
    cloud-like cutaway technique that is both intriguing and somewhat confusing.
    The exterior portions of the house are defined with a watercolor wash that
    enhances and slightly blurs the pen and ink details. In several areas, the
    watercolor became overworked leading to necessary corrections. These
    corrected areas, in conjunction with several unfinished details indicate
    that Gorey abandoned this piece as it was nearing completion. The swatch
    with the wallpaper pattern draft taped to the bottom margin further evinces
    Gorey's painstaking attempts at graphic patterning<br>These qualities make
    this a desirable work for the true Gorey fan as such process pieces are
    uncommon on the market.<br>Special thanks to Irwin Terry for his insights
    and assistance with this lot.

    <i>McCall's</i>. She also created advertisements for leading brands like
    Lucky Strike, Palmolive, and Betty Crocker, for which she produced a
    portrait of the fictional home baker. When magazines began reducing costs by
    replacing expensive commissioned illustrations with the cheaper medium of
    photography, McMein pivoted from her commercial career and primarily painted

    November 1976 to April 1979, spending four months in each Washington, D.C.,

    Seattle leg of  “Treasures” opened at Seattle Center’s Flag Pavilion on July
    15, 1978. Though the Seattle Art Museum sponsored the exhibition, the

    Pavilion, originally constructed for the 1962 World’s Fair, underwent a

  TYPESET: >-
    Group of 23 original scenic concept designs for the 1997 adaptation
    performed at Central Park's Delacorte Theatre, New York, directed by George
    C. Wolfe. All with graphite, four images include color pencil (one with
    ink); one drawing on paper, the rest on tissue (some tissue drawings backed
    with white paper). 15 smaller drawings on 253x356 mm; 10x14-inch sheets; 8
    larger ones on 356x482 mm; 14x19-inch sheets. <br><br>Considered one of the
    most beloved musicals of all time, the 1944 show about three sailors who try
    to cram a lifetime of New York experience into a single 24-hour leave,
    debuted Leonard Bernstein's famous score to lyrics and script by Betty
    Comden & Adolph Green. This production was its first major New York revival
    since 1971. <br><br>In Lobel's own words, <i>On the Town</i> was "the
    biggest and most ambitious production ever attempted at the Delacorte
    Theatre in the park. There is nothing there - and in order to do a sprawling
    musical with many locations, I had to come up with a giant machine that
    could hold a band, have a dance floor, and bring on all the scenery - at the
    same time not losing the sense of the spectacular locale of the park. It was
    only after sketching to the jazzy music for several weeks that I realized
    what I was drawing - a gigantic bridge with a 1940s band sitting on top - a
    bridge that could become Times square, The museum of natural history, Coney
    Island and many other places." The show was a great success in its original
    Central Park setting but failed to repeat that magic when it moved to
    Broadway.<br><br><br><br>Lobel has designed sets for Broadway, off-Broadway,
    and metropolitan and regional theater productions worldwide, including the
    Metropolitan Opera, Le Chatelet, The Royal National Theater, BAM, the Yale
    Repertory Theatre, Théatre Royal de la Monnai, New York City Opera, SUNY
    Purchase, and Central Park's Delacorte Theater. Her prolific work for the
    Mark Morris Dance Group is widely acclaimed. Many of her stage maquettes and
    designs are housed in the permanent collection of the McNay Art Museum, San
    Antonio, Texas, including those for the Houston Grand Opera productions of
    "Nixon in China" and "Street Scene." In 2002 she produced and was nominated
    for the Tony Award for Best Musical for "A Year With Frog and Toad" based
    upon the famous children's books by her late father, Arnold Lobel, whom she
    credits for instilling much of her work ethic and love of art.

    Ingalls in the celebrated television series) as "Ma", Steve Blanchard as
    "Pa", Kara Lindsay (Laura), Jenn Gambatese (Mary), Sara Jean Ford (Nellie),
    Kevin Massey (Almanzo Wilder) and Brian Muller (Clarence
    Brewster).<br><br>The musical continued with a 5-week engagement at the
    Paper Mill Playhouse, Millburn, New Jersey, on September 10, 2009 prior to a
    U.S. National tour that began in October 2009 at the Ordway Theatre, St.
    Paul, Minnesota.<br><br>Lobel's design concept was that the actors would
    literally build their own scenes just as the pioneers had to build
    everything themselves. The set was a simple series of wooden walls that
    could be reconfigured into many different structures and
    locations.<br><br>Lobel has designed sets for Broadway, off-Broadway, and

  TYPESET: >-
    Together, original painting and original study for unidentified projects,
    likely unpublished. Mixed media, including watercolor, gouache, metallic
    paint, and pencil on paper. The first is 630x500 mm; 24¾x19½ inches (sheet).
    Firmly adhered to linen board. Signed with Orazi's monogram in lower left

    to thick paper mount. Unsigned; not dated. Each matted and with simple
    gold-painted wood frames, study is missing glass. <br><br>The figure in the
    first and more finished artwork resembles Princesse Lointaine, who was
    famously played by Sarah Bernhardt and whose elaborate tiara adorned with
    lilies was immortalized and widely reproduced in imagery by poster artist
    Alphonse Mucha. While the sunflowers pictured here negate the likelihood of
    the artwork being intended as an image of the Princesse Lointaine, it
    certainly contains tropes and decorative elements quintessential to Orazi's
    oeuvre and the Art Nouveau style as a whole, such as use of sinuous curves
    and the intricate headdress, which he gives careful attention, likely due to
    his background as a jewelry designer. Orazi's jewelry was displayed at
    Samuel Bing's famed Maison de l'Art Nouveau in 1896, and his designs were
    also sold at La Maison Moderne. <br><br>Though it differs in the details and
    overall composition, the original study bears resemblance to Orazi's famous
    lithograph <i>Femme aux Orchidées (Nymph with Orchids)</i> in its rendering
    of a silhouette of a woman in profile with long tendrils of hair blowing in
    the wind. <br><br>Born in Italy, Orazi primarily worked in Paris creating
    graphic art in the Art Nouveau style and illustrations for advertisements,
    posters, calendars, books, and newspapers.<br><br>Such original studies by
    Orazi are uncommon on the market and desirable to collectors.

    same-titled story by Hans Christian Andersen (Mamaroneck, N.Y.:
    Once-Upon-A-Time Press, 1948). Includes two finished boards and process

    with text mock-up on paper. A copy of the published book accompanies the

    the final published layout.<br><br><i>The Nightingale</i> was referenced as
    "the only good comic book in existence" in Frederic Wertham's 1954 book
    <i>Seduction of the Innocent</i>, which denounced the comic book medium for
    its detrimental effect on children and eventually led to the establishment
    of the Comics Code Authority (CCA). Wertham calls attention to <i>The
    Nightingale</i>'s high-quality printing and paper and its beautiful colors,
    though he states that it cannot be considered a normal comic book because
    the dialogue is not delivered in balloons and it does "not confirm to the
    comic-book formula according to which a story is so abundantly illustrated
    that the action can be followed almost without reading any of the words"
    (pages 312-313). <i>The Nightingale</i> was the first of an intended, but
    ultimately unrealized, series by the publisher meant to elevate and redefine
    the comic book medium. <br><br>A master of watercolors, Kingman was a
    Chinese-American artist known for his picturesque landscapes and urban
    scenes and for pioneering the "California Style" school of painting. Kingman
    worked for the WPA from 1936 to 1941 and held numerous successful one-man
    gallery shows and well-received museum retrospectives. Throughout his
    career, Kingman was commissioned to illustrate the covers of leading
    magazines, including <i>Time</i>, <i>Life</i>, and <i>Fortune</i>, and
    painted numerous murals for companies like the Bank of California, the
    Ambassador Hotel in Hong Kong, and the Lingman Restaurant in New York City,
    which has been restored and is now housed in the Brooklyn Public Library.
    Additionally, Kingman designed posters for American Airlines and the
    Olympics. He also dabbled in Hollywood in the 1950s and 60s by serving as a
    technical advisor for numerous films and designing the title backgrounds for
    the films <i>55 Days in Peking</i> and <i>Flower Drum Song</i>. In 1981, he
    was invited to exhibit his work by the Ministry of Culture of the Peoples
    Republic of China, the first American artist to hold a retrospective since
    the countries resumed diplomatic relations.<br><br>Kingman taught at various
    institutions, including Columbia University, Hunter College, the Famous
    Artists School, and the Academy of Art College in San Francisco. Over his
    70-year career as an artist, he won numerous awards and accolades including
    two Guggenheim fellowships in 1942 and 1943, and the American Watercolor
    Society's Dolphin Medal in 1987, the organization's highest honor. His work
    is held in the permanent collections of leading institutions, such as the
    Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Whitney
    Museum, Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the
    Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. (Reference: DongKingman.org)

    historian H. W. Janson) to introduce them to the modern masters. Janson
    lives in a museum and learns to paint in the style of Albers, Rousseau,
    Warhol, Picasso and others until she creates her own original work, her
    "mousterpiece," and thus "arriving" as an artist. The book was listed on The

    Swift's famous satirical novel <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> by comparing the
    influx of Jewish immigrants into New York City to Gulliver and the
    Lilliputians. Cady drew upon stereotypes to depict the tiny Jewish men,
    rendered with exaggerated large and curved noses, who appear preoccupied
    with taking over the economy and turning a profit on everything from
    Gulliver's curly hair and hat, which they cut with saws and scissors, to the
    very land they inhabit that has been renamed "New Jerusalem."<br><br>Like
    many illustrators of his day, Cady's work sometimes reflected commonly held
    prejudices and several of Cady's illustrations leading up to World War I are
    tinged with the anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant sentiments seen here. It is
    not known if Cady shared these problematic views, or if he was carrying out
    the opinions of his publishers and their requirements for assignments.

  TYPESET: >-
    Original "The Captain and the Kids" Sunday comic, published December 27,
    1942 (United Feature Syndicate). Pen and ink with later colored pencil, on
    Bristol board. 383x572 mm; 15x22½ inches, on slightly larger sheet. Signed
    "R. Dirks" in first panel and with United Feature Syndicate pastedown label
    in fourth.<br><br>Rudolph Dirks was hired by William Randolph Hearst's New
    York Journal at the height of its circulation war with Joseph Pulitzer's
    rival paper, New York World. Hearst's editors commissioned Dirks to develop
    a Sunday comic based on Wilhelm Busch's popular prankish German character
    duo, Max and Moritz, in order to compete with the successful comic Down in
    Hogan's Alley in Pulitzer's World. Dirks created The Katzenjammer Kids,
    which starred Hans and Fritz, naughty protagonists who rebelled against the
    authority of "Mama" and "der Captain." After fifteen years of success, Dirks
    wanted to take a temporary year-long hiatus, which was denied by the
    syndicate. When he left without permission, Harold Knerr took over the
    strip. Dirks sued, but despite a long legal battle, Hearst was allowed to
    continue the strip's publication under Knerr's direction. However, Dirks was
    permitted to create a nearly identical strip for the rival Pulitzer paper in
    1914, which he initially titled Hans and Fritz, but later renamed The
    Captain and the Kids due to rising anti-German sentiment during World War I.
    With similar plotlines and characters, the two comics soon achieved near
    equal popularity. This comic is a fine example of the chaotic world created
    by Dirks where the pranks carried out by Hans and Fritz wreak havoc upon the
    relationships between "Mama," "der Captain," "King Bongo," and his
    queen.<br><br>Dirks made significant contributions to the graphic language
    of comic strips throughout his lifetime. Though not the first to use
    sequential panels or speech balloons, he influenced their wider adoption.
    Dirks is also often credited with popularizing the use of speed lines,
    "seeing stars" for pain, and "sawing wood" for snoring.

    at the 1992 MTV Music Awards. Cobain was a fan and repeatedly praised
    Johnston in interviews. Johnston's art and music drew upon his ongoing
    struggles with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, for which he spent
    periods in psychiatric institutions. Johnston was the subject of a 2005

    Architectural Press, 2016.<br><br>Meyerowitz's highly amusing architectural
    map was exhibited in the New York Public Library's Map Room for six months
    and won the silver medal at the Society of Illustrators in
    2018.<br><br>Journalist Mariana Zapata described it perfectly: "This 2008
    map by Rick Meyerowitz provides an illustration of what life could be like
    in New York in the year 2108. And according to the map, the future is very,
    very watery. The Metropolis 2108 shows most of New York City underwater. New
    Jersey is almost completely gone, except for a tiny stretch of land called
    West Lido. Some beloved NYC neighborhoods also meet a watery grave: Tribeca
    becomes Tribewa (Triangle Below Water), SoHo is now Beloho, the Lower East
    Side is the Lower East Pothole, and Hell’s Kitchen has been replaced by
    Hell’s Bathtub. Likewise, the only part of Brooklyn that survives is its
    downtown, crossed by the Atlantic Ocean Parkway, and renamed Forest City
    Ratner City after the real-estate company that rents office spaces in the
    area. The Statue of Liberty, perhaps the most widely recognized symbol of
    the United States, is gone entirely but for the forearm that continues to
    hold the torch above the water. Of course, not everything is bad in this new
    world. <br>Those who formerly thought the Metropolitan Museum of Art to be
    too antiquated and boring will in the future be able to enjoy the Met
    Aquarium, where a happy whale resides. Likewise, the Guggenheim will no
    longer hold abstract artworks. In fact, it will hold no expositions at all,
    since it will be a water park.<br>While concerns arise pertaining to certain
    perks of modern life we are accustomed to, Meyerowitz has taken the trouble
    to reassure us of our ability to adapt. Without streets, our beloved La
    Guardia airport will become Lagoona Airport and employ planes that can land
    on water. Even more importantly, coffee shops will be replaced by coffee
    boats that will transit all around the city, and recharge at the coffee
    tower to keep New Yorkers awake and happy. <br>Almost the entire landmass
    left after the great flood is invaded by megastores and retail giants like
    Whole Mart and Targbucks. Staten Island will be completely dedicated to
    these commerces, even being renamed “Mega Store Island. And if you want to
    spend your time in the post-apocalyptic world in luxury, Condo District
    looks like it has some great views over Lexington Avenue River. Otherwise,
    head over to The Trickle Downs neighborhood or Snipesland Tax Free Zone, in
    the present Upper West Side. Seasons may change, polar caps may melt, but
    exclusive neighborhoods will apparently persist until the end of
    time"--Atlas Obscura, November 21, 2016.
