  DESCRIPT: OSCAR WILDE (1854-1900)
  CROSSHEAD: >-
    Program from the original production of "The Importance of Being Earnest" at
    St. James's Theatre.
  year: '1895'
  TYPESET: >-
    4 printed pages, 250x190 mm; 10x7½ inches, on one folding sheet, with
    chromolithograph illustration on first page; horizontal fold, minor wear.
    London, circa March 1895.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This opening run of "The Importance of Being Earnest," in addition to
    introducing Wilde's final and most enduring play to the world, was also the
    period when he was publicly accused of sodomy and was plunged into legal
    difficulties. <br><br>As with all other examples of this program, it states
    that the play was "Produced Thursday, February 14th, 1895." That does not
    mean it was printed for the 14 February opening night performance, however.
    As with most examples, this copy shows a cast change. The original actress
    in the role of Cecily Cardew was Evelyn Millard, who fell ill and was
    temporarily replaced by Violet Lyster as shown here. That suggests a
    performance from some point in March 1895; Millard later returned to the
    production.

    with which each tableaux was designed and executed. The resulting
    photographs are well composed and printed. Both the scope and early date of
    this album add to its rarity--our research has not uncovered an early body
    of work that similarly documents a committed investigation of form and

    Balanchine and Igor Stravisnky, and his paintings are held by institutions
    such as the museum of Modern Art, New York and the National Gallery of Art
    in London, among others.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Nelson Barclift was a member of the US Army's Theatre Section during World
    War II. This image is from Irving Berlin's "This is the Army," which was
    written to boost morale and was shown on Broadway, cast entirely of members
    of the armed forces, to benefit the Army Emergency Relief Fund. Barclift was
    the co-choreographer and principal dancer for the musical. Though the
    musical was certainly problematic for its portrayal of stereotypes and
    inclusion of blackface, the unit that presented the performance off-Broadway
    was integrated, making it the first instance of racial integration in the
    armed forces (though it was still segregated when it came to on-stage
    performance). Additionally, almost every number in the musical included men
    in drag.

    Christopher Isherwood was a novelist and playwright and major figure in the
    gay rights movement. His semi-autobiographical novel "Goodbye to Berlin"
    (1939) became the premise for the iconic musical "Cabaret," and his 1976
    memoir "Christopher and His Kind" told the story of his life in gay Berlin
    in the 1930s. The latter remains a classic in gay liberation literature.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The Colt Studio Group was founded in New York in 1967, and built its
    reputation on the photography of founder Jim French (1932-2017), aka "Rip
    Colt." They originated in New York, soon moved to the Los Angeles area, and
    have been based in San Francisco since 2003. 


    Offered here is a large collection of material issued by Colt. The earliest
    is a packet of ten black and white photographs of a single model, 177x127
    mm; 7x5 inches, in a plain brown mailing envelope postmarked from New York
    on 2 August 1972. The mailing label has a horse's head and the studio's New
    York post office box. This predates the 1973 Miller v. California Supreme
    Court decision which clarified the legal status of pornographic material
    being sent through the mail. 


    Also included is a large collection of Colt material which was meticulously
    collected and preserved from 1992 to 2007. This includes: 


    16 "photo sets" produced between 1992 and 1999. Each one is a packet of
    photographs, 177x127 mm; 7x5 inches, devoted to a single model, in a sleeve
    printed with a copyright notice and catalog number. The model's name and
    receipt date are often added in manuscript by the recipient. Most are black
    and white photographs in sets of 10. 


    A compact disc of photographs of model Steve Kelso, thought to be the first
    Colt product issued in this format.

    The Athletic Model Guide was established by Bob Mizer in 1945. Mizer's
    imagery evolved from men in classically inspired bodybuilder poses, to pairs
    wrestling or in other tableaux, to men in small posing straps or otherwise
    covered, to full nudity. Mizer photographed thousands of models and created
    tens of thousands of images. He used his quarterly publication Physique
    Pictorial to advertise this imagery, which was available as photographic
    prints.

  CROSSHEAD: >-
    A photograph by Loomis Dean (1917-2005) of Harold Stevenson's groundbreaking
    40 foot painting "The New Adam" (1962).
  year: '1960'
  TYPESET: >-
    Silver print, the image measuring 171.5x342.9 mm; 6¾x13½ inches, with Dean's
    credit hand stamp on verso. 1960s.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Harold Stevenson's (1929-2018) painting, executed in 1962, was conceived as
    an homage to his lover, Lord Timothy Willoughby (though the model was Sal
    Mineo), and measures an astonishing 96x468 inches over a series of 9 panels.
    Initially exhibited in the 1960s in Paris, New York, Chicago, and LA
    (shocking viewers in each of the locations, apparently), the work was then
    rarely seen until it was shown again in the 1990s at the Mitchell Algus
    Gallery (in 1992) and the Andy Warhol Museum (1998). The work is now owned
    by the Guggenheim Museum. This photograph is accompanied by an "Art in
    America" article, which compellingly places this work within its art
    historical context and quotes Stevenson describing his monument work as
    intended "to be beyond captivity, beyond containment, where flesh is
    endless." Loomis Dean's photograph of the painting places it in a somewhat
    less formal presentation, but clearly evokes the overwhelming scale,
    romantic beauty, and extraordinary achievement of the work.

    fashion and performing arts began in the 1950s where, after serving in the
    Italian Campaign in World War II and completing studies at The Art Students
    League on the GI Bill, he was launched into the fashion world as the head
    illustrator for The New York Herald Tribune under Eugenia Sheppard. Soon to
    follow were positions at The London Sunday Times, American Vogue, The New
    York Times, and Italian Harper's Bazaar where he famously covered Yves Saint
    Laurent's first and last collections (1958 and 2002). However, it is as
    Halston's Creative Director throughout the 1970s that he is best remembered.
    That time was recently chronicled in the popular Netflix series "Halston" in
    which Eula is skillfully portrayed by actor David Pittu.

    <i>Here to Dare 10 Gay Black Poets</i>, (Galiens Press, 1992), cover
    image.<qr><qr>Other Countries is a rare early painting by Michael Cummings
    that references Modernism and is an investigation of African imagery from an
    African-American aesthetic. Known as a consummate quilter since the 1970s,
    Michael Cummings began his artistic career as a painter. A Los Angeles
    native, he moved to New York City in 1970 and joined a circle of leading
    Black artists, becoming friends with Norman Lewis, Camille Billops, Romare
    Bearden, and his wife Nanette Rohan.<br><br>The lot is accompanied by a copy
    of the published book <i>Here to Dare, 10 Gay Black Poets</i>, edited by
    Assotto Saint.  8vo, wrappers. First Edition, First Issue. New York: Galiens

    Bernard Branner, Don Charles, David Warren Frechette, Cary Alan Johnson,
    Steve Langley, Craig A. Reynolds, Harold McNeil Robinson, Robert Westley,
    John D. Williams and Arthur T. Wilson.<br><br><i>Here to Dare</i> is a
    collection that reveals the acute and poignant double-consciousness of men
    born Black and gay, and their fierce determination to survive. For editor
    Assotto Saint being black and gay brought sexuality and power to the
    forefront of his work. He worked alongside other black gay poets to express
    their experiences and to bear witness to their struggles. Saint was
    unabashed in his nature and representation through his persona and
    writing.<br><br>Assotto Saint was born Yves François Lubin in Haiti and
    moved to New York City as a young adult. Known as a poet, publisher and
    performance artist, he was a key figure in LGBT and African American
    literature of the 1980s and 90s. Before turning to literature, he was a
    dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company from 1973 - 1980. After editing
    and penning poetry anthologies in the 1980s he won the 1992 Lambda Literary
    Award in Gay poetry as editor of <i>The Road Before Us</i>. He was also a
    nominee in the Gay Anthology category at the 5th Lambda Literary Awards for
    <i>Here to Dare</i>, and in the Gay Poetry category at the 7th Lambda
    Literary Awards for <i>Wishing for Wings</i>. In 1990 he was awarded a
    fellowship in poetry from the New York Foundation for the Arts and received
    the Black Gay and Lesbian Leadership Forum's James Baldwin Award. After
    Saint and his life partner were diagnosed HIV-positive, he became a fervent
    AIDS activist. He was one of the first African American activists to
    publicly disclose his HIV status. Saint died on June 29, 1994 and was buried
    alongside his partner at the Cemetery of the Evergreens, Brooklyn, New York.

    July [1969]. 


    "2nd Gay Liberation Meeting." "Homosexuals are no longer going to sit back

  TYPESET: >-
    7 typed letters and postcards signed by Williams, 1978-79; 9 postcards and

    Williams: A Bibliographical Checklist of his Writings" (Haverford, PA,

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The North Carolina poet and publisher Jonathan Williams is best known for
    turning bits of Appalachian vernacular "found language" into avant-garde
    poetry, and as the founder of the prestigious small press, The Jargon
    Society. <br><br>Offered here is the witty correspondence of Williams with a
    friend. He notes that the poet Joel Oppenheimer recently visited North
    Carolina and "was nearly run out on a rail for using the word cunt in
    public--not once but many times. Ah well, I don't use that word but I fear I
    use all the others, when the fit is on me." Recounting his recent interview
    in Gay Sunshine magazine, he notes "Mercy on us--there wasn't much left to
    tell. Which spares us from such chores for awhile, I hope." He jokes that
    "You never know about kids--that's why I never consider anyone below 22,
    when the brain has had some time to materialize. It's no trick to look
    groovy at 17, but, so what?"<br><br>Also included are 6 blank postcards
    issued by the Jargon Society (numbers 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, and 14), most
    featuring text by Williams and one featuring his image (captioned "Jonathan
    Williams, en route to the Birthplace of Dizzy Gillespie").

    <br><br>An exceptional color work by Tom of Finland. In a clever homage to
    the recipient, a good friend and resident Canadian, the breeches and boots
    of the soldiers are those of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. It is also
    the only major color work to feature brown boots as opposed to his usual
    black. <br><br>Tom of Finland (born Touko Laaksonen) pioneered a new freedom
    and aesthetic in gay erotic art. Coming of age in a time and place of
    extreme censorship, he was inspired by the "beefcake" photographs that were
    primarily distributed through body building magazines of the 1940s and `50s
    to create a visual language for gay men that was hyper-masculine and, over
    time, increasingly graphic, depicting the wildest sexual fantasies. Always
    instilled with a playfulness and joyful involvement of the participants,
    they also toyed with rebellion and put sex, politics, history, and
    aesthetics on a level playing field. His work became an inspiration for
    generations of artists to find their own voice and expression. His drawings,
    photographs, and collages can be found in several important collections and
    museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art,
    the Art Institute of Chicago, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, San
    Francisco Museum of Modern Art, among others.

    well as the multi-layered challenges faced by queer women looking for family
    and connections: "The photograph I took of women in a circle holding hands
    with their feet touching is the connection that holds the love of a

    These letters from the much-beloved playwright to a close friend in Houston
    reflect his strength, generosity of spirit, and ready wit, with substantial
    insight into his creative process and professional life. The correspondence
    extends from 1988 to 2018, with the longest, most frequent, and most
    substantial letters from 1988 to 1990. In his first letter, McNally hopes to
    visit during an opening in Houston: "I do hope to see you both, and wonder
    if we can do the de Menil collection or something else marvelously
    high-toned (or low, I'm easy)" (8 October 1988), and followed up with
    thanks: "I couldn't have asked for better looking, brighter or just sassier
    tour guides" (9 June 1989). He sent condolences on his friend's partner's
    death soon after: "I will never forget the kindness he showed me . . . and
    the grace and courage with which he faced his ordeal" (6 August 1989). On 18
    September he added "I know these are hard, painful times for you. There's no
    reason they shouldn't be. Use your friends. That's what we're here for."


    A remarkable letter from 12 October 1990 starts with an apology for his
    [perfectly legible] handwriting: "That's one of the reasons I don't write
    many letters. The main one is that I never felt I wrote very good ones. I've
    gotten used to speaking through my characters instead of in my own voice,
    though Cal's last speech in Andre's Mother and whole chunks of Stephen in
    Lisbon are pretty close to what I sound like talking. . . . I am not an
    unhappy man. I am an angry one. I'm working on it but it's still there. I'm
    sure you've already seen it. It's everywhere in the plays, which is probably
    the best place for it. When it comes between me and another unsuspecting /
    undeserving person, I feel deeply sad and ashamed." On 31 August 1990 he
    wrote "My new play is called Lips Together, Teeth Apart. Do you like it?
    Tell me while there's still time." <br><br>Those who seek inside
    show-business content will not be disappointed. On 24 October 1990 McNally
    discusses the film adaptation of his "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de
    Lune" starring Al Pacino: "I rented Sea of Love last night and think Al (I
    really do know him, have for years) will be a wonderful Johnny. My agent
    told me this morning that Michelle Pfeiffer is set for Frankie. I told them
    last week why I didn't think she was right for the role, but they went ahead
    and hired her. Maybe the film will bear some resemblance to the play." The
    next day, after receiving an Emmy award for Andre's Mother, he sent two
    rather silly photographs posing with the trophy, adding "Sending you this
    photo proves I have no vanity . . . I need psychiatric help." On 9 November
    1998, he wrote that a local restaurant was "still recovering (so am I) from
    the sight and sound of my being serenaded by Liza, Chita, Patti LuPone &
    Glenn Close singing a special birthday song by Kander & Ebb. . . . Too bad
    it wasn't taped." <br><br>On 7 August 1991, McNally reflected on the
    horrific gay-bashing murder of Paul Broussard: "The murder upset me
    terribly, probably because it was Texas, which, like it or not, I will
    always be connected to. Please let me know what happens. . . . I assume the
    assailants will get maximum sentences (I am for the death penalty)." On the
    other hand, many of McNally's postcards are leavened with whimsy and humor.
    On a postcard of Long Island's "Big Duck" near his Hamptons weekend home, he
    wrote "This is the great tourist attraction of L.I. I saw Madonna here!" (18
    August 1990). On a postcard of Toronto's baseball stadium, he writes "Is
    this card butch enough for you?" (1992). <br><br>Also included are: 11
    photographs (a warmly inscribed black and white publicity portrait and 10
    snapshots). <br><br>A collection of 9 of McNally's books, signed and
    inscribed to his friend between 1988 and 1994, all in hardcover with dust
    jackets except as noted: The Lisbon Traviata; Frankie and Johnny in the
    Clair de Lune; It's Only a Play; The Ritz; The Ritz and Other Plays; Lips
    Together, Teeth Apart; A Perfect Ganesh; Three Plays by Terrence McNally
    (paperback); and 15 Short Plays (paperback); plus 7 other unsigned trade
    paperbacks featuring McNally's works. <br><br>A pair of signed playbills
    from performances of "Lips Together, Teeth Apart," 1991 and 1993; and
    unsigned playbills for "A Perfect Ganesh" and "Kiss of the Spider Woman"
    (the 1992 premiere in Toronto); and a file of 31 clippings and other
    ephemera.

    <br><br>Provenance: from the collection of Christopher Lione.<br><br>This is
    the <i>rare</i><b>FIRST</b> printing of the poster, printed before the image
    was turned over to ACTUP<br><br>According to Lione, "the first printing by
    us of the Silence = Death poster (before ACT UP existed) is a custom size
    based on the proportions of our design. Subsequent printings (printed by ACT
    UP and others) are longer."<br><br>The Silence=Death Collective formed in
    the early years of the AIDS epidemic including Avram Finkelstein, Chris
    Lione, Jorge Socarras, Oliver Johnston, Charles Kreloff and Brian Howard.
    This poster appropriated the Nazi regime's pink triangle for the
    Collective's own positive and empowered usage. The text at the bottom of the
    poster was printed in smaller typeface, "forcing intimate contact on the
    part of the reader…The poster was about complicity, at all levels, but it
    also needed to inspire action" (After Silence p. 48). In this first printing
    of the poster, a misunderstanding resulted in several misprints in the
    smaller text at the bottom. When the government agencies were actually
    spelled out to the typesetter of the poster they were misread as "The Center
    for Disease Control" as opposed to the "Centers" and it also read "Federal
    Drug Administration," instead of "Food and Drug Administration." The poster
    originally hit the streets in mid-March 1987, less than a month before ACT
    UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) was formed. The Collective eventually
    turned the rights of the poster to ACT UP who reprinted it, first without
    making any changes, but then reprinted it, again, with the correct names of
    the government agencies. This poster was not, as many have written, the work
    of artist collective Gran Fury. Gran Fury (named after the type of Plymouth
    automobile used by the New York City Police Department) formed in 1988, the
    year after this poster was designed.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Laura Aguilar's groundbreaking work focused primarily on the queer, Latinx,
    and working class communities of her native Los Angeles, using portraiture
    to examine gender identity, class, and body politics, as well as mental
    health and representation within the art world. Some of her early series of
    work focused on the communities of which she was a part, including "Latina
    Lesbians," "How Mexican is Mexico," and "Plush Pony," the last of which
    documented patrons at a working class lesbian bar. But far more than a
    documentarian, Aguilar also turned the camera on herself, using her body to
    create vulnerable images investigating her own exploration of identity and
    relationship with her body and mental health. Now considered as vastly ahead
    of her time, the series "Stillness" brought Aguilar critical success. In
    these images, she posed herself as an element of the Southwestern landscape,
    curling her body around rocks or curved on the ground, her face turned away
    or shielded from the viewer. She is both seen and unseen, in work that is
    both poetic and poignant.

    Acquired directly from the Artist.<br><br>The self-portrait was created
    during Sepuya's residency at the Studio Museum of Harlem as part of a series
    of photographs entitled "Studio Work." The body of work explores the
    physicality of the studio and the presence of his friends and self in that
    space, a theme that continues in his artistic practice today. Known as a
    postmodern portrait photographer, Sepuya challenges traditional portraiture
    by filtering it through the black queer gaze.
