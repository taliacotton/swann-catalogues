    Edwin Hale Lincoln moved to the Berkshire area in 1893, less than 10 years
    after taking up photography. He had previously been a drummer boy during the
    Civil War and a page in the Massachuetts House of Representatives, but now
    largely made his living photographing large yachts and estates, as well as
    the burgeoning Berkshire "summer cottages." 


    Lincoln's spare aesthetic contrasted with the Photo-Seccessionist's
    concurrent embrace of Pictorialism, and instead his clean images can be seen
    within the context of the American Arts & Crafts movement (his work was
    published in Gustav Stickley's The Craftsman, where they received warm
    praise). In many ways a precursor to later, "straight" landscape photography
    prominent on the West Coast, Lincoln's quiet botanical studies both elevate
    his subject matter as well as elegantly reveal the plants' detailed, quiet
    complexities. 


    Lincoln began working on this series in the early 1890s and finished it in
    1914. He printed the photographs and produced sets for subscribers.

  footnote_provenance: >-
    Cunningham's "Shell Collection 3" features an array of textures and values,
    including detail-rich dark grays and blacks and luminous, glittering
    highlights. Cunningham's approach in this elegant still life is emblematic
    of the modernist aesthetic that she is known for and championed, and also a
    work that hints at abundance, one that is evocatively sensual. This duality
    characterizes much of her work.


    Cunningham's earliest photography was Pictorialist in nature, but after a
    1923 meeting with Edward Weston, she began to favor a modernist approach.
    Her flora and fauna studies of the 1920s and 30s are often associated with
    this shift. These distinctly rendered, close up, elemental, and lush
    renderings of plant life were first shown in the landmark Film und Foto
    exhibit in Stuttgart in 1929. By 1932 she would be a charter member of the
    West Coast Group f.64, whose members favored sharp, unfiltered, and
    unmanipulated imagery. Their direct, or "straight," photographic approach
    eschewed compositional manipulation in favor of recording, and certainly
    this influence can be seen in "Shell Collection."


    However, Cunningham explored other photographic styles and subjects
    throughout her long career. "I photograph anything that can be exposed to
    light," she said, and indeed here her apparent desire to look closely from
    all angles and translate to photographic paper form, light, and shape, hints
    at an emotional appreciation for form and abstraction.

    Silver print, the image measuring 11¾x8¾ inches (29.2x22.2 cm.), the mount

  footnote_provenance: >-
    From the Photograher to his wife, Elsa Naess; presumably to Paul Katz, New
    York, ex-director of photography, Marlborough Gallery; to dealer George
    Rinhart, North Carolina; to Michael Shapiro Gallery, San Francisco, in 1997;
    to a Private Collection.


    Beckmann was a student at the Bauhaus from 1928-1932, where he studied under
    Wassily Kandinsky and Josef Albers. He left shortly before the school was
    closed by the Nazis, first to Vienna where he continued to study
    photography, and then to Prague where he worked as a photographer and for
    the resistance to occupation. In 1944 he was imprisoned in a concentration
    camp until the end of the war.


    After the war, Beckmann moved to the United States where he became head of
    the photography department of the Guggenheim Museum and then an art
    professor at The Cooper Union and Dartmouth College. By the 1960s, Beckmann
    became known for his precise, geometric paintings, artwork he is still
    principally known for today. These paintings are characterized as being
    concerned with light and space, a theme of perception that could also be
    identified in the photograph offered here, a study of the distinct and
    elegant form of a pair of spectacles, here slightly abstracted as seen in
    layered light and shadow.


    A photograph by Beckmann of a single pair of glasses was part of the Gilman
    Paper Company Collection acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was
    sold at auction in 2006 for $18,000.

    Acquired from the photographer when Frank was a visiting artist at Visual
    Studies Workshop in Rochester, New York in 1971. 


    Robert Frank, a photographer who is indelibly associated with the inequity,
    grit, beauty, and pardox of the American social landscape, included a number
    of images featuring cars in his seminal photo book "The Americans." In his
    vision, Americans are on the road together, alone, for pleasure, out of
    necessity, sometimes in gleaming autos, sometimes a blur of speed and joy,
    sometimes a means of endured transport, sometimes a means of finding
    connection with others, sometimes a means of displaying and establishing
    identity. Memorably, the last image in the volume features Frank's family
    huddled in a car ("U.S. 90, en route to Del Rio, Texas"), a marker of his
    own cross-country road trip to make images, and his own relationship with an
    automobile. 


    This one, shrouded and situated under two looming palm trees, its form made
    distinct and hard in the California light, is the most iconic. The folds of
    the cover offer an elegant visual couterweight to the rest of the
    composition, the draping lines and the gleaming textile subtly suggesting
    their own sensuality. The image seemingly speaks to 1950s economic comfort
    and to the glamerous (if mysterious) California lifestyle, while
    simulaneously offering a sly commentary on our national obsession with cars.


    Jack Kerouac, in his iconic introduction to "The Americans," comments on
    this photograph: "Car shrouded in fancy expensive designed tarpolian to keep
    soots of no-soot Malibu from falling on new simonize job as owner who is
    two-dollar-an-hour carpenter snoozes in house with wife, and TV, all under
    palm trees for nothing, in the cemeterial California night."

    A gift from art dealer and artist Peter Tunney; to the Present Owner by
    Descent. 


    Peter Beard was a photographer well-known for his pictures of Africans and
    African wildlife. He made his first trip to the continent when he was 17,
    photographing with a Voigtländer camera his grandmother had given him. In
    2013 Beard wrote to Robert Kolker, a journalist for New York Magazine>, "I
    made a life for myself in Africa that was as far as you could possibly get
    from art school at Yale." 


    In the 1960s, concurrent with a project about the demise of starving
    elephants and black rhinos, Beard began creating elaborate, large format
    photo-collage "diaries" (hardly an unheard of project for Beard; he had been
    making diaries with collaged imagery since the age of 12). The "diaries"
    incorporated everything from postage stamps to news clippings to smears of
    animal blood. He purchased Hog Ranch, an encampment outside of Nairobi, in
    the mid-60s. In the following decades, his work focused on documenting the
    Kenyan environment, its people, wildlife and landscape, as well as
    conservation and man's impact on nature. From the 1970s until his passing in
    2020, Beard split his time between Hog Ranch and his home in Montauk. 


    This photograph, entitled Cheetah Orphans in Mweiga near Nyeri>, is one of
    Beard's most iconic images, a poignant and impactful depiction of two
    orphaned cheetah cubs. Though this image is the basis for other works, each
    piece is entirely unique, as each photograph is treated as a district canvas
    upon which Beard has added his drawings, collages, and/or handwritten text.

    Sidibé was a frequent attendee of the late night social scene in Mali during
    the 1960s and 1970s where he would photograph young men and women partying,
    posing, and dancing to Western music. Following the event he would process
    the film and print proof prints, which he mounted to a folder with the
    inscribed event date and individual inventory numbers. Party attendees could
    then place orders for the photographs. Through this form of documentation,
    Sidibé became a chronicler of the independence and transformation of Mali.
