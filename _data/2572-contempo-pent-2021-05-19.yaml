    <br><br>According to Associated American Artists, "While the discs pulsate
    in the upper portion of the Bursts, configurations of brush strokes erupt
    below.  Deeply bitten arc-like surfaces of the brush strokes . . . suggest a
    more unpredictable and violent action than the glowing pulsations of the
    discs . . .  Gottlieb (1903-1974) posits two vital and opposing forces.  And
    while each has the potential to subsume the other, he has discovered a
    unifying structure that allows them to function in a relationship of
    complementary equilibrium."  Associated American Artists 66.

    full margins.  Signed, dated and numbered 75/150 in pencil, lower margin.  A
    superb impression with strong colors.<br><br>After high school, Gottlieb
    (1903-1974) attended the Art Students League in New York and traveled Europe
    in the early 1920s.  He became friends with Mark Rothko (1903-1970) in the
    1930s and the two often worked and exhibited together when possible.  He and
    Rothko were founding members of the group of artists known as The Ten, who
    began meeting together in New York in 1934.<br><br>Around the early 1930s,
    Gottlieb also became interested in etching, buying an old press from a junk
    shop and printing proofs for his own enjoyment, in extremely small editions,
    most of those which survive are from the early 1940s.  These early etchings
    show strong ties to the Surrealist prints of Joan Miró (1893-1983), Kurt
    Seligmann (1900-1962) and Yves Tanguy (1900-1955).  Whether or not Jackson
    Pollock (1912-1956) ever knew these early etchings by Gottlieb hasn't been
    determined, though there are certainly affinities with Pollock's 1944-45
    intaglio prints from Atelier 17.  Associated American Artists 72.

    lower loop and thereby changing the way in which the lines and forms are
    perceived in relationship to one another.  Moreover, by working with a small
    area of drawn image that opens up and outward on a large sheet, she achieved
    strong play between the densely saturated colors and the negative space in
    which they are so precariously balanced.  The surface is further activated
    by the inverted V-image, drawn with crayon skipping across the fine mesh of
    the screen."  Harrison 25.

    directly on the screens with liquid tusche.  This method of screen making
    allowed her the gestural freedom that is not available in either the
    hand-cut film process or photo-stencil methods."  Harrison 70.

    president from 1950 to 1972.  He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in
    Vienna with the sculptor Karl Sterrer (1885-1972) and worked in Paris from
    1937 to 1939.  Neuwirth was a well-traveled artist.  He lived on Gran
    Canaria, one of Spain’s Canary Islands, off northwestern Africa, during the
    early 1940s, and also visited North Africa and South America, then resided
    the U.S. in 1950, where he came under the influence of Abstract
    Expressionism, evidenced by the current work.  From the mid-1950s onward,
    until his retirement as an artist, Neuwirth taught at the Modeschule der
    Stadt Wien, and his style shifted away from abstract toward more
    representational work, imbued with influences from Surrealism.  At a
    career-spanning, 70-year retrospective exhibition of his work, "In the
    Paradise of Pictures," 2002, at the Kunsthalle Krems, held on his 90th
    birthday, Newirth was honored with the Great Golden Decoration of Honor of
    the Federal State of Lower Austria.

    (1887-1975) studied under the Belgian Art Noveau master Henry van de Velde

    and Stuttgart.  In Munich, early in his career, Ackermann was a member of
    <I>Der Blaue Reiter</i> from 1918-19 and exhibited with Kandinsky in the
    1920s.  During the late 1920s, he spent time in Paris, where he became
    friends with Piet Mondrian (1906-1944).  Ackermann was deemed a degenerate
    artist by the Nazi government in 1933 and was forbidden from teaching and
    exhibiting; most of his works were also confiscated and destroyed. 
    Nevertheless, he retreated to the countryside and continued his abstract
    work at Hornstaad on Lake Constance, which became a thriving artists'
    colony.  After World War II, Ackermann resettled in Stuttgart and became
    among the leading mid-century abstract artists in Germany.

    his lifetime, including Tibor De Nagy, Leo Castelli Gallery and André
    Emmerich.  Numerous prominent museums have exhibited his work during the

    primarily known for his Art Deco sculpture and portrait busts, though he
    also practiced printmaking, drawing and painting where it related to his
    scultpural works during his early career.  Lovet-Lorski developed arthritis
    in the late 1930s which worsened with age; in the late 1950s he could no
    longer raise his arms above his head.  With his sculptural output
    diminished, he turned to painting.  His late-career abstract paintings, like
    the current work, echo the mythological and fantasy subject matter of his
    Art Deco works while channelling the artist's "innermost self," his
    memories, and his interest in natural beauty.

    Oil on canvas, circa 1960.  510x582 mm; 20¼x23 inches.  Signed in oil, lower
    right recto.<br><br>Ex-collection private collection, New York.<br><br>Kim
    (1917-2014) was a Korean-American artist, born in Changnyeong, Korea.  He
    was among the first of a generation of Korean artists who moved to the
    United States in the 1950s and is one of the earliest-known Korean artists
    to permanently work and reside in New York.  Kim's Eastern and Western
    artistic training enabled him to develop a unique visual fusion of both
    traditions while he explored different styles throughout his career, from
    Abstract Expressionism in the 1950s, to realist still-life drawings in the
    1970s and large-scale Neo-Expressionistic figurative and allegorical works
    from the 1980s onward.  Kim was immersed in the downtown New York art scene
    of the 1950s, interacting with many of the New York School artists active at
    the time.  In this environment, he pursued Abstract Expressionism with a
    lyrical, sweeping, calligraphic style, evinced by the current masterful oil
    painting.<br><br>Among the downtown art scene he met his future wife, the
    artist Sylvia Wald (1915-2011).  Together with the artist Lenore Tawney,
    they purchased a house at 37 East 4th Street, which they renovated with
    artist studios and gallery.  In 1978, Kim and Wald purchased the building at
    417 Lafayette Street, where they lived and worked until their deaths. They
    established the Sylvia Wald and Po Kim Art Gallery, a non-profit art
    foundation, which is still located there today.

    during the ascent of Abstract Expressionism, a bohemian artist whose friends
    included Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline.  Probst's work
    pursued two distinct paths, one was figurative expressionism in which he
    portrayed Biblical and spiritual themes, albeit not subject driven, the
    other was purely non-objective.  The latter evidently had some influence on
    Kline, their relationship is repeatedly noted by Probst in his extensive
    private journal, discovered after his death, and evidenced by Kline's
    seminal Abstract Expressionist oil painting, <I>Probst I</i>, 1960, now in

    Vienna from 1945-49 and sculpture at Fritz Wotrubas' (1907-1975) sculpture
    classes from 1953-56.  He was inspired by classical antiquity and Italian
    Renaissance sculpture, which greatly valued a figure's proportions. 
    Avramidis blended abstraction with figuration often creating forms with
    heightened texture and sensuality.  He noted of his work, “My work
    demonstrates the execution of an objective, that is to say, of a perfectly
    graspable form. This form is the primary prerequisite for creating a work of
    art.  In this I try to remove any personal stylistic influences from my
    work.  The only real references in my work are to Antiquity and Early
    Italian Renaissance.”

    facial features, these <I>stelae</i> often bore names like <I>Double Booger
    for a Little John</i>, or <I>The Suicide</i>.  The first of these was later
    described as a "spirit trap" for a person the artist detested.  The latter
    may have been a meditation on the death of Ernest Hemingway, whose suicide
    was front-page news in the summer of 1961.  The contrast between his
    untitled and his named works was becoming extreme."

    tried different pigment formulations and drying methods.  Alpert secluded

    galleries, and instead taught painting at the Cooper-Union School of Art in

    (1907-2001), having little formal art instruction, is generally considered a
    self-taught artist.  He worked for the Easel Project, part of the WPA during
    the Great Depression; his early works are imbued with the Social Realist
    style of this era.  Though he was in the same circle as Mark Rothko
    (1903-1970) and Jackson Pollock (1912-1956), and appreciated their pure
    abstraction, Lechay never completely strayed from representational art. 
    Nevertheless some works in his <I>œuvre</i> like the current watercolor
    explore the psychology of tonality with a nod toward Rothko's abstraction.

    York.<br><br>Bloc (1896-1966) was born in Algeria and moved to France in
    1898, where he later studied engineering and architecture, coming under the
    influence of Le Corbusier (1887-1965) in the early 1920s.  He worked in art
    publishing during the 1920s and 1930s, founding several important journals,
    including <I>L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui</i>, before turning to sculpture
    in the 1940s.  He created his first large sculptures in Paris between 1949
    and 1956.  In 1951, in company with several other artists, Bloc formed the
    group Espace, the goal of which was to bring the ideals of constructivism
    and neo-plasticism to urbanism and design.  Artists and urbanists such as
    Jean Dewasne, Etienne Bóthy, Jean Gorin, Félix Del Marle, Edgard Pillet,
    Victor Vasarely and Sonia Delaunay were also members of the group.  Bloc
    focused primarily on sculpture and design during the 1950s up until his
    death in 1966.  In 1959 he participated at "II. documenta" in Kassel,
    Germany, the second edition of the ground-breaking international
    quinquennial contemporary art exhibition.

    Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C., gifted by the
    artist.<br><br>Rickey (1907-2002) is celebrated among the foremost American
    kinetic sculptors.  Born in South Bend, Indiana, he was reared in the United
    Kingdom and graduated with a history degree from Balliol College, Oxford,
    where he also studied frequently at the Ruskin School of Drawing.  Rickey
    furthered his artistic training, at the advice of his father, a Singer
    Sewing Machine Company executive, in Paris at the <I>Académie L'Hote</i> and
    <I>Académie Moderne</i>, studying modern painting and drawing.  He returned
    to the U.S. in 1930 and began the first in a series of art teaching
    positions before he was drafted and served in the U.S. Army Air Force
    (1942-45).  In 1946, Rickey returned to Muhlenberg College, Allentown,
    Pennsylvania, to become the chairman of the art department (which he had
    help organize in 1941).<br><br>Rickey began experimenting with kinetic
    sculpture in 1945.  His first sculpture was exhibited in New York in 1951 at
    The Metropolitan Museum of Art group show <I>American Sculpture</i>.  The
    MoMA purchased his stainless steel sculpture <I>Two Lines Temporal I</i>,
    1964, after then director Alfred Barr had seen it at the exhibition
    <I>Documenta III</i> in Kassel, Germany.<br><br>Rickey created the current
    etching, along with several other versions of the mythological subject
    <I>Apollo and Daphne</i>, while studying printmaking during the fall of 1947
    with Mauricio Lasansky (1914-2012) at the University of Iowa.  He left his
    teaching position at Muhlenberg College the following year and focused his
    work on sculpture from the 1950s onward, settling with his family to East
    Chatham, New York, by 1960, and ultimately becoming among the leading
    kinetic sculptors of the 20th century.

    Meier-Denninghoff in Berlin, studied at art schools in Berlin and Munich. 
    She was a co-founder of the Munich group "ZEN 49" in 1949, a member of the
    Deutscher Künstlerbund and also worked as a studio assistant for the British
    modernist sculptor Henry Moore (1898-1986) and the Russian-French
    constructivist sculptor Antoine Pevsner (1884-1962).   She met Martin
    Matschinsky (born 1921) in 1952 at the Darmstadt-based experimental theater
    of Gustav Rudolf Sellner, where Meier-Denninghoff worked as a scenographer
    and Matschinsky as an actor.  The couple married in 1959 and started working
    together, primarily in sculpture.  The same year, they exhibited their
    collaborative work at "II. documenta" in Kassel and received the Prix
    Bourdelle Award.  During the 1960s, the couple developed their
    characteristic technique of elegant shimmering, curved, chromium-nickel
    tubes that were set together in bundles, seemingly weightless, as monumental
    outdoor sculptures.

    pencil and numbered 6/17 in ink, lower margin.  Printed by Pratt Graphics
    Center, New York.<br><br>Gego (born Gertrud Goldschmidt, 1912-1994) created
    this series in a collaboration with poet Alfredo Silva Estrada (1933-2009). 
    Gego was a leading figure in Venezuelan abstraction in the 1960s and 1970s. 
    She was born in Hamburg and studied engineering at the University of
    Stuttgart in 1938.  Facing increasing Nazi persecution, her family was
    Jewish and her German citizenship was nullified in 1935, she moved to
    Venezuela in 1939 and became a citizen in 1952.  Gego made her first
    sculpture in 1957, steeped in the burgeoning Caracas avant-garde art scene,
    and went on to become a leading practitioner of kinetic sculpture.  Her work
    is interested in space, transparency and structure highlighting the contrast
    of oppositions such as light and darkness and stasis and dynamism.  In the
    current works, which are three-dimensional relief prints, she collaborated
    with poet Alfredo Silva Estrada whose poem echoes the themes in Gego's
    artistic output.

    is a pioneer of the Photorealist school.  Born in Birmingham, England, he
    studied art at the Birmingham School of Art from 1952-58 and the Slade
    School of Art in London from 1958-60.  He moved to the United States in 1966
    to teach at the Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, where he
    worked under Grace Hartigan (1922-2008) who influenced his early Abstract
    Expressionist paintings.<br><br>During his time in Baltimore, he discovered
    the work of photographers Garry Winogrand (1928-1984) and Lee Friedlander
    (born 1934). He admired their documentary style and adapted some of their
    photographs to paintings in a photorealist manner eliminating any trace of
    Expressionist sensibilities.<br><br>He began taking his own photographs and
    his work from that point onward focused on automobiles, often wrecked or
    decrepit in rural settings.  To create his paintings, Salt draws an outline
    onto the canvas using a photograph projected from a slide.  Color is added
    using an airbrush, with stencils used to get a precise effect.  This
    eliminates the hand of the artist and removes any trace of self-expression. 
    He continues to paint American scenes despite returning to England in 1978.

    Photorealist and Hyperrealist movements of the 1960s and 1970s.  Initially
    attracted to downtown New York avant-garde scene, and as an assistant to
    Franz Kline (1910-1962), he exhibited successfully with the Abstract
    Expressionists at the fabled Tenth Street galleries, the Tanager and Hansa,
    and in the Stable Gallery annuals, where he had his first one-man show in
    1962.  The 1963 death of his father was pivotal in his artistic career, and
    thereafter he began using photographs as source material, either
    appropriated from the media or taken himself.  In 1972, the Americans Chuck
    Close, Richard Estes and Kanovitz were chosen to join Europeans Gerhard
    Richter, Sigmar Polke, Malcolm Morley and Franz Gertsch, in the
    groundbreaking international art exposition "documenta V," in Kassel,
    Germany, as the pre-eminent exponents of this new photo-based painting which
    came to be known as Photorealism.

    right recto.<br><br>Ex-collection Harriet Lyons, Portland,
    Oregon.<br><br>Neel (1900-1984) is known as one of the premier American
    portrait artists of the 20th century for her images of family, friends,
    lovers, fellow artists and others, filled with psychological acumen and
    emotional intensity.  Born in Pennsylvania, she studied at the Philadelphia
    School of Design for Women in the early 1920s where she realized her
    affinitiy for portraiture.  In 1932, she moved to New York after a brief
    period living in Havana, Cuba.  During the 1930s she worked for the WPA, but
    struggled to support herself as an artist during the first nearly three
    decades of her career. As Abstract Expressionism surged to popularity during
    the 1950s, Neel rejected artistic trends and remained committed to
    portraiture in her characteristic expressive style.  Around 1960 she began
    gaining recognition for her work, and her career flourished with the advent
    and support of the women's rights movement in the late 1960s and 1970s.  By
    1974 she was the subject of a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum of
    Art Art, New York, and she continues to be recognized as a major figure in
    20th Century American art.<br><br>Neel was interested in subjects of
    different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds and her sitters ranged
    from the elite, such as art critic and Museum of Modern art curator Frank
    O'Hara, to her neighbors in Spanish Harlem.  In the current work, she
    depicts Harriet Lyons, a founding editor of <I>Ms. Magazine</i>, journalist,
    and art collector.  By 1970, Lyons had been involved with a
    consciousness-raising group of art professionals, which included curators,
    artists and art historians.  In 1971, she wrote a cover story for the
    <I>Village Voice</i> about women's sexuality in art at a time when women
    were starting to challenge male definitions of art.  A leading figure in the
    feminist movement, she supported female artists through her writing,
    personal art collection and activism, which included being a member of the
    Board of Advisors to the New York Feminist Art Institute alongside Alice
    Neel that launched in 1979.<br><br>Lyons recalled, in a 2005 Feminist Art
    Institute interview, "I wrote a cover story for the <I>Village Voice</i>
    about women's sexuality in art, women artists exploring sexual and female
    imagery. The whole idea and question of a unique female imagery has been
    posed.  This was a time of guerilla tactics and street theater to break down
    barriers to women’s equality. Female artists were talking about where they
    were coming from and what their work was about. While these discussions
    could get heated, it never escalated to the behavior I had witnessed among
    male artists in the ‘60s, especially at post-openings loft parties. 
    Liquored up, these guys would invariably come to blows arguing about art
    (and who was flirting with whose wife or girlfriend).  The point is that
    women, too, had strong theories about art, and in the ’70s were finally
    raising their voices against the male definitions of art and the separation
    of fine art and craft (any work made by a woman that involved stitchery was
    'craft').  Women were making huge breakthroughs and expressions in their art
    specific to women.  The whole question of a woman's imagery was hotly
    debated.  Clearly, the time had come to publicly address the male biases in
    art-making and how artists were educated.  To that end, two members of our
    consciousness-raising group were behind pioneering institutions: The New
    Museum of Contemporary Art, founded by Marcia Tucker in 1977, and the New
    York Feminist Art Institute, spearheaded by Nancy Azara and launched in
    1979.  The latter came out of long, probing discussions of women's
    experiences in art education and the studio.  Those who were trained at the
    Art Students League, School of Visual Artists, Parsons, RISD, the
    Philadelphia School of Art, all had similar experiences about how rigid the
    sense of what art was, what the techniques were, what the imagery was.  They
    all expressed being very much reined in by this overwhelming male model. 
    They never had female teachers.  The only women they saw were models or
    other female students."

    by Éditions Claude Givaudan, Geneva.<br><br>Meadows (1915-2005) was a
    prominent British modernist sculptor and one of eight British artists
    represented in the "New Aspects of British Sculpture" exhibited in 1952 at
    the XXVIth Venice Biennale (which also who included Robert Adams, Kenneth
    Armitage and Lynn Chadwick).  He was Henry Moore's (1898-1986) first studio
    assistant before becoming a Professor of Sculpture at the Royal College of
    Art, London, for twenty years, then returning to assist Moore in 1977 as the
    elder artist's health began to fail.  Following Moore's death, Meadows
    became an acting director of the Henry Moore Foundation.<br><br>In the
    mid-1960s Meadows took on a commission from the publisher Givaudan to
    illustrate Samuel Beckett's novel <I>Molloy</i>, the first of three
    novels--the Beckett Trilogy--initially written in Paris between 1947 and
    1950.  In his own words, Meadows chose <I>Molloy</i>, because he thought it
    was, "A completely impossible book to illustrate . . . I tried . . . I
    looked upon it as being a series of etchings parallel to what Beckett's
    attitude might have been, but it was a bit far fetched."  The complete boxed
    portfolio, a true multiple in every sense, echoes Marcel Duchamp's
    (1887-1968) <I>Boîte-en-valise</i>, created between 1935 and 1940 in a
    deluxe edition of 20, a portable miniature monograph including 69
    reproductions of the artist's own work.  Reflecting on the project, and his
    collaboration with the publisher Givaudan, Meadows noted that he made a
    series of 35 color aquatints with etching as the covers for each of the
    booklets that were intended to hang, "On a certain Meccano-like contraption
    which Givaudan had thought up.  It was all a bit silly, and I think Beckett
    thought it was silly too! . . . The box which contained the `Meccano' set,
    and copies of . . . the whole book, <I>Molloy</i>, was cut into 35 pieces;
    Givaudan cut it into pieces, so he seemed to think that they were the
    natural breaks, but I didn't see that and I don't think that Beckett saw it
    either . . . . I looked upon it as being a series of etchings parallel to
    what Beckett's attitude might have been, but it was a bit far fetched."

    (1928-2008) was a Japanese-born artist who studied at Kanazawa Fine Arts
    University during the turbulent era of the occupation of Japan and began
    showing his work in Tokyo galleries as part of the “Timism” group of
    Japanese abstract artists.  In the early 1960s he decided to live the life
    of an expatriate artist and sailed across the Pacific on a tramp steamer
    bound for Santiago, Chile.  By 1965 he had settled in New York, living in a
    tenement on the Lower East Side, unable to afford canvas he painted on bed
    sheets.  By this time, he'd begun experimenting with the geometric, shaped
    canvas format that has come to characterize his work and for which his
    popularity gained at galleries and public collections in New York and
    throughout the United States.

    was born in Queens and studied at Syracuse University before finishing his
    BFA at Tufts University and the School of Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in
    1959.  He moved to New York where he began an artistic career that focused
    on abstraction, rejecting the artistic trends of the time such as Pop Art of
    Neo-Expressionism, to further explore how abstraction could incorporate
    texture as well as color.  In the 1970s, he found his distinctive style
    composed of unconventional shapes with bold but simple color palettes.

    Jackson, Mississippi and from a young age was fascinated by machines and
    creating objects by hand. He joined the Navy where he continued to learn
    about machinery and technology, skills he would later put to use in his
    sculpture.  He moved to New York in 1961, scouring the streets for
    electronic items that he could use in his interactive sculptures.  Seen as a
    pioneer of kinetic and electric sculpture, he often incorporated mirrors and
    electronic parts into his sculpture.  His work is held in the Solomon R.
    Guggenheim Museum, New York, the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York,
    and The Museum of Modern Art, New York, among others.

    collection, New York.<br><br>Brown (1945-2012) was a Chicago-born, New
    York-based artist whose style was lossely figurative abstract
    expressionist.  He was raised near the steel mills on Chicago's Southside
    and was exposed to the blues through musicians in the neighborhood such as
    Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and Memphis Slim.  In 1970, Brown moved to New
    York and began to collaborate on multi-media projects with other artists
    including jazz musicians.  During the 1980s, he focused much of his work on
    creating portraits of jazz and blues musicians, including popular artists
    such as Ornette Coleman, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday and Lionel Hampton
    in addition to less well-known jazz and blues artists, exhibiting many of
    these works through Marlborough Gallery, New York.

    architecture and painting in the mid-1960s at the Escola Superior de Belas
    Artes in Lisbon, leaving before attaining his degree in frustration with the
    school's conservative approach.  He lived and worked around the world,
    including the United States and Morocco, before returning to Portugal to
    work as an artist.  He has employed sculpture, film, installation and
    painting, with the body central to his work.  Often rendered in androgynous
    and simplified forms, the bodies he depicts reflect on desire and intimacy
    as well as the possessive aspect of the male gaze.

    Margull, Berlin.  Published by Griffelkunst, Hamburg.  From <I>Black
    Palms</i>.  A superb impression with vibrant colors.<br><br>According to the
    artist, the <I>Black Palms</i> series, "Came about whilst working with the
    printer Fritze Margull. He came down to Port of Spain, Trinidad where I have
    set up house and studio. We built a small make shift studio in the corner of
    a large warehouse space--we had a small table top press that we used to
    proof the plates with. The images for the etchings for the most part are
    relatively new ones for me although I have made some drawings, and water
    colours using similar imagery.  I am in the process of using the images to
    make larger scale paintings now.  I have found that making etchings prior to
    making paintings is a useful way to familiarize myself with the subject and
    imagery," (Griffelkunst).  Doig (born 1959) notes that the compositions for
    many of the images were actually derived from a set of old postcards he'd
    bought in London showing various Indian scenes, which he in turn combined
    with his Trinidad experiences.  In the case of <I>Pelican</i>, "The figure
    dragging the dead pelican was dragging a fishing net in the Indian post
    card--I saw a man killing and dragging a pelican along a beach here
    [Trinidad]; dinner," (Griffelkunst).

    paintings from his recent "Bather" theme at the Vienna Sucession in 2019,
    one of which is the basis for this print.  The images are a homage to the
    American modernist painter, Marsden Hartley (1877-1943), though Doig has
    utilized a photograph of Robert Mitchum on a beach in Trinidad (where the
    artist currently lives and works).  Mitchum is nearly unrecognizable in
    Doig's representation, a dark moonlit sea and a nude, kneeling woman to his
    right adding an air of mystery to the scene.
