  TYPESET: >-
    Engraving, circa 1490.  121x85 mm; 5x3½ inches.  Trimmed on the plate mark. 
    A superb, richly-inked impression of this extremely scarce engraving, with
    very strong contrasts and no sign of wear, consistent with the earliest
    impressions of this subject.<br><br>From a series of 10 engravings by
    Schongauer (1448-1491) of the Wise and Foolish Virgins which illustrate the
    parable in Matthew 25:1-13.  According to the parable, heaven is likened to
    the house of a bridegroom.  The five wise virgins, anticipating that they
    might have to await the groom, have brought enough oil to keep their lamps
    burning; they are shown by the artist holding their burning lamps with
    outstretched arms, facing to the right, with pleasant expressions and with
    their wedding wreaths on their heads.  In contrast, the foolish virgins,
    unprepared for their grooms' delay, have allowed their oil to run out and
    have had to go off to buy more.  On their return, the bridegroom's door was
    shut to them.  They are shown with downcast expressions, their wedding
    wreaths on the ground, holding extinguished lamps and facing left.  The wise
    virgins, ready for their grooms, are like the righteous in their
    preparedness for entry into heaven.<br><br>Provenance: Mary Jane Morgan, New

  CROSSHEAD: 'Christ Enthroned, with two Angels.'
  TYPESET: >-
    Engraving, circa 1475-80.  170x120 mm; 6¾x4¾ inches.  With thread margins
    outside the narrow border line or trimmed on the border line.  A brilliant,
    richly-inked impression of this exceedingly scarce, early engraving, with
    very strong contrasts and little to no sign of wear.<br><br>According the
    National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., which holds another impression of
    this engraving, "Christ Enthroned, with two Angels is one of the finest
    compositions from Schongauer’s mature period in a corpus of well over a
    hundred prints . . . The engraving depicts Christ in his manifestation as
    God the Father, redeemer of the world.  Haloed, crowned, and enthroned, he
    bears a scepter and an orb, all symbols of celestial royalty.  Two angels
    beneath a canopy draw apart curtains to reveal the figure of the deity
    bestowing his blessing.  In performing this service, the angels also enact a
    theological metaphor.  The Latin word for veil (vela) is the root of the
    word "revelation," literally "to unveil."  Thus, in the modest dimensions of
    a print, Schongauer has presumed to perform no less than a revelation, as if
    to evoke the famous passage: 'For now we see through a glass darkly; but
    then face to face' (1 Corinthians 13:12)."<br><br>Provenance: Richard
    Herrlinger, Vienna, with the blue ink stamp verso (Lugt 5818; according to
    Lugt, Herrlinger was advised by Joseph Meder, the curator of prints at the
    Albertina, Vienna, who specialized in early German engravings and was the

  CROSSHEAD: The Crucifixion.
  TYPESET: >-
    Engraving, circa 1480.  196x153 mm; 7¾x6¼ inches.  Gothic letter P with a
    flower watermark.  With narrow margins outside the border line.  A
    brilliant, richly-inked impression of this exceedingly scarce engraving,
    with very strong contrasts and no sign of wear, consistent with his earliest
    impressions of this subject.<br><br>Working in Colmar, once a part of
    southwestern Germany that is now Alsatian France, Schongauer (1430-1491) was
    among the earliest known northern artists to fully utilize the craft of
    engraving.  Many of his prints, like his few known paintings, reveal an
    affinity with the work of early Netherlandish artists such as Jan van Eyck,
    Roger van der Weyden and Dirk Bouts. Schongauer imitated the monumentality
    associated with the altar paintings of these celebrated Netherlandish
    artists.<br><br>Schongauer's exquisitely engraved images were circulated
    widely throughout Europe.  The sheer number of engraved copies of
    Schongauer's prints, made by other artists during his lifetime, attests to
    his popularity and the significant demand for his work in the late
    15th/early 16th century (Schongauer made approximately 115 engravings of
    different subjects, of which there are an equivalent number of different
    copies made by other artists during the late 15th century alone.  One of
    Schongauer's best known engravings, The Death of the Virgin, early 1470s,
    was copied in at least seven different prints by the early 16th century). 
    Most importantly, he was one of the first printmakers who developed an
    individual style and whose engravings helped to stimulate an interest in
    collecting prints hitherto unseen in northern Europe.<br><br>Schongauer's
    work paved the way for the success of subsequent printmakers and was
    profoundly influential to the generation of engravers who proceeded him,
    most notably Albrecht Dürer (see lots 7-11 and 25-48). In 1492, the
    21-year-old prodigious Dürer intended on training with Schongauer, but
    arrived at the master engraver's workshop just months after his death. 
    Dürer went on to emulate Schongauer by incising deep engraved lines in his
    plates to extend their printing life, thereby increasing their commercial
    viability, and ultimately surpassed Schongauer's appeal and
    popularity.<br><br>Provenance: Kupferstichkabinett, Staatliche Museen zu

    extremely scarce, early engraving.<br><br>According to Shestack, Meckenem's
    Christ before Pilate is, "An obvious various on the composition invented by
    [Martin] Schongauer.  Meckenem depicts the judgment hall of Pilate.  Christ
    is led in at the right, as Pilate washes his hands to declare his innocence
    (Matthew 27:24).  In the left background, the cross is already being
    prepared, while at the right, Judas tries to return the bag of silver to the
    elders.  The figure in the foreground who leads Christ by a rope and grasps
    Him by the collar appears to be derived ultimately from the executioner in
    the right wing of Roger van der Weyden's St. John Altarpiece," (Fifteenth
    Century Engravings of Northern Europe, Washington, D.C., 1967, number 188).

    superb, dark, richly-inked and early impression.<br><br>Castiglione
    (1609-1664) was among the most original graphic artists of the 17th century,
    exchanging prints and ideas with his contemporary Rembrandt van Rijn, among
    others, as well as being one of the first artists to experiment
    significantly with the monotype technique.  The ambitious composition of The
    Bodies of Saints Peter and Paul Hidden in the Catacomb reflects the
    influence of Rembrandt’s luminous compositions in which Christian tales are
    transformed into something metaphysical.  The subject derives from the
    Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voraigne, which suggests that the saints’ bodies
    were cast into a well near the clandestine catacomb vault, seen here in
    Castiglione’s dramatic rendering.  The artist often etched such erudite

    principally in the poses and in the views of the figures' heads, suggest
    that the engraving was copied from a lost, preparatory drawing.  Mantegna
    executed the Parnassus, as well as two other paintings, Minerva Expelling
    the Vices from the Grove of Virtue and Comus, for the studiolo of Isabella
    d'Este [in Mantua].  The Parnassus is based on the story of Venus and Mars,
    who were trapped in bed by a bronze net fashioned by Vulcan, her husband,
    and then put on display to the great amusement of the other gods," (Early
    Italian Engravings from the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1973,
    page 228).<br><br>Giovanni Antonio da Brescia (active circa 1475-1519)
    worked in the circle of Andrea Mantegna (1431-1506) frequently translating
    his drawings and other designs into engravings.  During his early career he
    used the initials "Z.A." to sign some twenty engravings, and until recently
    Zoan Andrea was regarded as a distinct printmaker; it is now realized that
    they are the same person, and the "Z.A." stood for Giovanni Antonio,
    "Zovanni" being a north Italian spelling. Around 1507 he began to use
    formulae such as "IO.AN.BX.", and signed some prints more fully. The real
    Zoan Andrea was a very obscure painter, documented as working in Mantua in
    the 1470s, who produced no engravings.  Giovanni Antonio da Brescia began
    his traceable printmaking career in the circle of Mantegna, arriving in
    Mantua in the 1490s, and leaving around 1506, perhaps after Mantegna's death
    that year.  He may have been relatively old and experienced as an artist in
    another medium when he joined the aged Mantegna.  It is assumed he moved to
    Rome, as his later engravings depict works available to him only in that
    city, but the date this happened varies between different accounts.  He also
    appears to have spent time in Florence, as one of his engravings copies a
    drawing by Filippino Lippi.  Brescia's recently expanded œuvre comprises at
    least 150 engravings, including the current work.  Hind 21.

    the short vertical scratch under the center of the bridge, with burr in the

    with the several delicate scratches in between the upper feathers, with
    particularly strong contrasts and no sign of wear, consistent with the
    earliest lifetime impressions in this state.  High crown watermark  (Meder
    20, which he dates from around 1480 to 1525 and cites for early second state
    impressions of this subject).  An extremely scarce impression in this
    quality, with the wings black and great clarity in the landscape, with every
    detail distinct.<br><br>The early 1500s was a period of dramatic growth in
    Dürer's (1471-1528) career and the fuller recognition of Italianate
    influence in his art. His workshop expanded with his increasing popularity,
    enhanced significantly by the wide-scale distribution of his engravings and
    woodcuts throughout Europe, with the addition of three young artists: Hans
    Baldung Grien (1480-1545), Hans van Kulmbach (circa 1485-1522) and Hans
    Schäufelein (circa 1482-1539/40). Dürer was preoccupied with a focus on the
    construction and proportion of the human figure at this time too,
    doubtlessly on account of his knowledge of Italian Renaissance art and
    recent travel to northern Italy, creating numerous drawings of standing
    female nudes and two of his most important engravings on the subject, The
    Nemesis and Adam and Eve, 1504.<br><br>According to Bartrum, there is a
    preparatory ink drawing for The Nemesis, now at the British Museum, London,
    which, "Is the earliest occasion that a proportionately constructed figure
    appears in one of his prints . . . The drawing also shows that Dürer
    originally planned a smaller, different type of wing, with the tips hanging
    down," (Bartrum, Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy, London, 2002, page 73). A
    separate study of wings on the same sheet shows how he ultimately intended
    to make them on the engraving, larger and much more intricately detailed.
    Dürer's handling of the figure of The Nemesis or Fortune was striking and
    revolutionary for its time, starkly silhouetted against the blank white
    background of the sheet of paper and floating ethereally along a
    drapery-like cloud lining above a minutely detailed
    landscape.<br><br>Bartrum notes that the subject, "Comes from the Latin poem
    Manto (Mantua) written by the Italian poet and philosopher Angelo Poliziano
    (1454-1494) and printed by Aldus Manutius in Venice in 1498. Dürer probably
    became acquainted with it through Pirckheimer (the humanist and Nuremberg
    friend of the artist). Nemesis, the classical god of retribution, whose
    goblet and bridle represent reward and castigation, is combined with the
    traditional winged figure of Fortune standing on a globe. The landscape
    beneath has been identified as a view of Chiusa in the southern Tyrol (Alto
    Adige), of which Dürer had presumably made a drawing during his journey to
    Italy in 1494-95, although no record survives," (Bartrum, page 140). Bartsch

    series of so-called Six Knots were based on Italian engravings from the
    circle of Leonardo da Vinci made around 1490-1500.  Bartrum notes that the
    earliest impressions of Dürer's Knot woodcuts were printed on paper with an
    Italian watermark of a cardinal's hat, also seen on Dürer's drawings from
    his Italian sojourn in 1505-07, which makes it likely that these woodcuts
    were produced by the artist while he was still in Venice or shortly after
    his return to Nuremberg.  "It is unclear what type of ornament is indicated
    in these designs.  They may have been designs for embroidery or they may
    have served as patterns for a kind of decorative puzzle for artists working
    in various crafts.  Similar knot designs occur in paintings and mural
    decorations of Leonardo's school, such as the ceiling of the Sala delle Asse
    in the castle at Milan," (Bartrum, Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy, Princeton,

    watermark.  Trimmed on the plate mark, with partial thread margins outside

    Study and Knight, Death and the Devil, all from 1514 and related in size,
    style and technical complexity, have been considered his master engravings
    (or "meisterstiche") since their creation nearly 500 years ago.  Replete
    with symbols (some recognized and some cryptic) and brimming with
    psychological content, Melencolia I is perhaps the most persistently studied
    and written about image in the history of art next to Leonardo da Vinci's
    Mona Lisa.<br><br>Melencolia I has been described as representing the
    contemplative life, and more specifically the melancholic pitfalls of an
    overly intellectual, creative temperament, with the large seated figure in
    the engraving possibly an allegory of the artist himself, symbolizing
    artistic melancholy.<br><br>Certainly an event that shaped Dürer's life and
    his outlook during this period was the illness and death of his mother on
    May 16, 1514.  Whatever part this played in his creation of Melencolia I, it
    is clear from his diary entries as well as a moving charcoal portrait of his
    mother from 1514 (now in the Kupferstichkabinett, Staatliche Museen,
    Berlin), in which he detailed her illness, that her death weighed heavily on
    his mind leading up to and during the creation of this
    engraving.<br><br>While modern scholars often group Dürer's three master
    engravings from 1514 together, suggesting they were conceived as a set by
    the artist and commercially offered as such, this was evidently not the
    artist's intent (though the Roman numeral "I" in the title of the current
    work might also suggest that Dürer had a series in mind).  He often sold
    impressions of Melencolia I and St. Jerome in his Study together, though
    this is likely due to their highly recognized importance even during his
    life and their contemporaneous creation.  Bartsch 74; Meder 75.

    woodcut.<br><br>We have found only five other impressions at auction in the
    past 30 years.<br><br>According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York,
    where there is another impression of this woodcut, along with the two other
    subjects which form the series of three, "In 1534 Baldung [1484/85-1545]
    made three woodcuts of wild horses in a dark and dense forest, a subject
    unique to him that had neither precedent nor following.  The prints are so
    idiosyncratic that they must have had strong personal meaning for him, then
    in about his fiftieth year.  Even though the horses and their poses do not
    look entirely real, they are fascinating in their strangeness and
    intensity.  This [a Group of Seven Horses] is the least overtly sexual of
    the three works, but it may be guessed that the stallions are fighting for
    possession of a mare.<br><br>In the equestrian monument or portrait, in both
    antiquity and the Renaissance, the horse was deemed a noble creature, a
    fitting mount for the ruler or leader being glorified, and both Leonardo da
    Vinci and [Albrecht] Dürer made plans for treatises on the ideal proportions
    of the horse.  Also since antiquity, however, horses--both stallions and
    mares--were equally reputed to be extraordinarily lustful.  Further, in
    Germanic folklore the horse was associated with evil forces often having to
    do with witchcraft.  The larger subject of these woodcuts, with their
    violence and pent-up energy, is the power of forces beyond man's
    understanding or control, specifically the overwhelming strength of the
    carnal instinct.  Bartsch 56.

    Second state (of 2), with the address of Salamanca.  Animal in a circle with
    an indiscernible name watermark.  A very good, dark and well-inked
    impression of this important Renaissance engraving.<br><br>Of the nearly 250
    engravings created by Raimondi (circa 1480-circa 1534), approximately 50 are
    known to be based on designs by the iconic Renaissance artist Raphael
    (1483-1520).  The 16th century Florentine artist and chronicler Giorgio
    Vasari credited Raimondi and Raphael with inventing "reproductive
    printmaking" and thereby the market for prints made after famous paintings
    and sculpture, which is still thriving to this day.  Vasari claimed that
    Raimondi's engravings were produced after paintings and frescoes by Raphael
    and that Raphael had a significant role in the production and marketing of
    these engravings, though recent scholarship has shown that for the most part
    Raimondi (and his "school" or workshop, including Agostino Veneziano and
    Marco Dente) worked from drawings by Raphael and that the engraver took the
    lead in popularizing these prints.  Nevertheless, Raphael and Raimondi were
    clearly close collaborators.  Raimondi was depicted as a sediario in
    Raphael's fresco in the Stanza di Eliodoro, 1511, of the famous Vatican
    Stanze; he acted as a witness in Raphael's purchase of two houses in Rome in
    1515; and Raimondi engraved an intimate portrait of Raphael around 1518
    (Bartsch 496).<br><br>The Judgment of Paris is based on a small grisaille
    painting by a member of Raphael's school in the Stanza della Segnatura of
    the Vatican Stanze and the existence of several copies of lost drawings of
    this composition indicate more direct ties to Raphael himself.  This famous
    composition has been appropriated, in whole and parts, by many artists over
    the centuries, most notably by Édouard Manet in Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe,
    1862-63, now in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris.  Bartsch 245.

    singular images of himself and several others of himself in different guises
    or grouped with other portrait studies.  This etching, created at the age of
    27, two years after he had moved to Amsterdam from Leyden to establish
    himself as an independent artist, and just months before he married Saskia
    van Uylenburgh (the first cousin of the art dealer and print publisher
    Hendrick van Uylenburgh), is among Rembrandt's most introspective
    self-portraits.  The dark shading covering much of his face, which rapidly
    disappears in later impressions, the deep-set eyes and the quiet, hunched
    pose lend it a reserved appearance, which is markedly different from the
    proud, well-lit, frontal poses of his subsequent self-portraits from the
    mid-to-late-1630s, as his stature as a foremost Dutch artist was rising.

    with strong contrasts, and little to no sign of wear.<br><br>Clement de
    Jonghe (1624/25-1677) was among the most significant Amsterdam print and map
    dealers and publishers during the mid-17th century and would certainly have
    been associated with Rembrandt (1606-1669), though there is no indication,
    through letters or in the inventory drawn up after Clement de Jonghe's
    death, that this was a commissioned portrait from Rembrandt.  De Jonghe's
    business prospered from at least around 1647 to 1679, run posthumously for
    several years following his death by his widow Jacomijntje Jacobs, until his
    stock was sold at auction.  De Jonghe acquired at least 74 of Rembrandt's
    original etched copper plates, probably during Rembrandt's lifetime, and
    these were all sold in the contents of his estate auction.  Bartsch 272;

    good, dark and richly-inked impression, with the landscape through the
    window distinct.<br><br>Francen (1612-after 1678) was a close friend of
    Rembrandt (1606-1669) and a lifelong resident of Amsterdam (though records
    of the various addresses in the city where he lived indicate that he was not
    a particularly well-to-do collector). He was a passionate connoisseur of
    art, which Rembrandt alludes to with the Crucifixion triptych and the
    landscape painting on the wall of Francen's study, as well as the Taoist
    sculpture on the table, and in this collecting eclecticism he and Rembrandt
    surely had a kinship.<br><br>Francen testified for Rembrandt and helped
    support him through his financial difficulties in the 1650s and 1660s; he
    also acted as a sort of guardian for Rembrandt's only child (of four) to
    survive into adulthood, Titus (1641-1668). Rembrandt likely made this etched
    portrait of Francen out of friendship rather than as a paid commission.

    A very good, dark, richly-inked impression with strong contrasts, with the
    acid spots to the left of the sitter's nose and with all the details
    distinct.<br><br>Sylvius (1563/64-1638) was a learned Mennonite preacher,
    related to Rembrandt's (1606-1669) wife Saskia van Uylenburgh, who Rembrandt
    was courting when this portrait was done (they married in 1634), and was the
    godfather of their first child, their son Rumbartus (who died just two
    months after his birth in 1635). Having served as a minister for the Dutch
    Reformed Church in several Frisian communities, he was called to Sloten near
    Amsterdam and the Gasthuiskerk in the city itself in 1610, and after 1622
    was employed at the Oude Kerk.  Rembrandt made another, posthumous portrait
    etching of Sylvius in 1646 (see Bartsch 280). <br><br>Provenance: Christian

    (of 5), before the extensive reworking of the face.  A very good, dark and
    well-inked impression.<br><br>Rembrandt (1606-1669) etched some 30
    self-portraits, with 27 singular images of himself and several others of
    himself in different guises or grouped with other portrait studies.  This
    self-portrait, created at the age of 27, just two years after he had moved
    to Amsterdam from Leyden to begin to establish himself as a successful
    independent artist, and months before he married Saskia van Uylenburgh, is
    among Rembrandt's most introspective self-renderings.  The dark shading
    covering much of his face (which rapidly disappears in later impressions),
    the deep-set eyes and his quiet, hunched pose lend an almost shy, reserved
    appearance, which is markedly different from the proud, expressive, frontal
    poses of his self-portraits he made from the mid-to-late-1630s.  Bartsch 17;

    the oil painting of Abraham's scarifice by Pieter Lastman, Rembrandt's
    mentor, from 1635.  They both drew from the melodramatic treatment of the
    subject in the painting--Abraham with knife in hand intecepted by the angel
    just prior to sacrificing his son Isaac.  Hollstein 1.

    commissioned him to make a series of illustrations based on Dante’s Divine
    Comedy.  Blake was then in his late sixties and infirm.  A contemporary
    account informs us that he designed 100 watercolors of this subject "During
    a fortnight’s illness in bed."  The 102 designs he created were left at
    Blake's death in 1827 in various stages of completion, ranging from pencil
    sketches to highly finished watercolors.  Most show an expressive freedom in
    the handling of color washes far greater than Blake's earlier watercolors. 
    In 1826, Blake began to engrave large plates based on seven of the designs,
    the current engraving is one; these were also left incomplete at his death.

    Studiorum.  A superb, richly-inked impression.<br><br>Mer de Glace, Valley
    of Chamonix, Savoy is part of a series of 81 mezzotints created by Turner
    (1775-1851) and other printmakers, after his oils, that have come to be
    known as the Liber Studiorum.  These mezzotints are based on original
    watercolors by Turner, which are in turn derived from his paintings,
    essentially a visual catalogue raisonné of all his works.  It's considered
    that Turner approved of the mezzotint process as it simulated the appearance
    of watercolor on moist paper, which was among his preferred techniques and,
    in recognition of their commercial viability.  The 1820 introduction of
    steel mezzotint plates (as opposed to copper, which produced very limited
    quality impressions before the plate wore down and required reworking) may
    have prompted him to issue these prints.<br><br>The Liber Studiorum series
    was produced primarily by Charles Turner and other engravers under the
    direction of J.M.W. Turner, with Turner himself working on 11 of the plates
    (including this one).  Turner also produced the 12 additional plates which
    comprise the Little Liber Studiorum, a series of prints that was a sequel to
    the Liber Studiorum. The Liber Studiorum encompassed the entire œuvre of
    Turner's work by mixing historical, pastoral, architectural and landscape
    scenes, while the Little Liber Studiorum presents ethereal atmospheric
    landscapes, representative of the iconic paintings for which he is now
    famous.  Finberg 50.

    upper right corner and still with the pentimenti of the upside down figure
    lower right distinct.  Proprietary watermark.  A brilliant, richly-inked
    impression with very strong contrasts. <br><br>The model for Venus  is
    Fumette, Whistler's Parisian mistress during the late 1850s.  This is one of
    three portraits he made of her at the time.  Her pose resembles Rembrandt's
    nudes, notably the figure in Jupiter and Antiope, etching, 1659, while the
    sensuality of the subject recalls nude paintings by the French painter
    Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) from around this time. <br><br>According to
    MacDonald, Frederick Wedmore, the prominent collector of Whistler's
    etchings, unflatteringly described Venus as, "A naked woman lying on her
    side, in bed, apparently sleeping, and with bent arm raised to her breast .
    . . It is the nude seen by Mr. Whistler with rather common eyes, for
    once--an animal, whom sleep has overcome." <br><br>MacDonald cites 27

    for its bird motifs, 1876-77, resulted in a dispute over the artist's
    excessive work and exorbitant price for the work and a falling out with his
    key patron.  Whistler is reported to have said to Leyland, "Ah, I have made

    Renoir's friends, Suzanne Valadon and Paul Lhote.  Valadon (1865-1938) is
    more commonly agreed on as one of the models.  Originally a trapeze artist,
    she became an artist's model after an injury ended her performing career;

    most elaborate prints, is among the lithographs he published in the 1890s,
    when color lithography finally began to shed its commercial associations and
    became a vehicle for original expression.  His efforts in this medium were
    greatly indebted to the enterprising encouragement of two men: the Parisian
    dealer Ambroise Vollard, who commissioned prints by contemporary artists,
    and eventually became the most important print publisher of his time; and
    Auguste Clot, the great lithography printer who printed many of Vollard's
    editions.  Vollard believed that by using the finest paper and inks and
    employing the best master printers his editions would appeal to collectors
    as affordable alternatives to unique works.<br><br>To create this print,
    Renoir made a preliminary drawing on paper, which was transferred to the
    lithographic stone.  He then reworked the image on the stone, using
    lithographic ink.  After this state was printed, he colored an impression
    with pastel, which the printer then used as a guide for the preparation of
    the color print.  The final print bears the kind of loose, feathery markings
    and vivid, atmospheric coloring that are hallmarks of Renoir's paintings. 
    The subject, which Renoir had previously treated in a pastel and an oil
    painting of 1893, as well as in three etchings of 1894, is the painter
    Berthe Morisot's daughter, Julie, pinning flowers on her cousin Paulette's
    broad-brimmed hat.   Delteil 29.

    nearly two decades after Mallarmé’s first publication of Poe translations. 
    Nevertheless, Mallarmé’s continued association with The Raven--indeed,
    almost an implied merging of his identity with that of the narrator of the

    Lithograph on Chine volant, 1889.  220x205 mm; 8⅝x8⅛ inches.  Edition of
    50.  From Études Lithographiques, one of 11 lithographs made by Gauguin for
    the Café Volpini exhibition, Paris.   A very good impression of this
    extremely scarce, early lithograph. <br><br>Both Gauguin (1848-1903) and his
    friend Émile Bernard made a series of lithographs for the seminal 1889
    exhibition of paintings at Volpini's Café des Arts, Paris, under the name
    "Groupe Impressioniste et Synthétiste."  The show was organized under
    Gauguin's supervision after fellow artist Claude-Émile Schuffenecker had
    found exhibition space for their work at the Volpini Café des Arts on the
    grounds of the Exposition Universelle.<br><br>Gauguin who had returned to
    Paris during the winter of 1889, before the Exposition Universelle and
    directly after his ill-fated sojourn with Vincent van Gogh in Arles the
    previous fall, executed 11 lithographs--including the current subject and 10
    others that would be exhibited at the Volpini show--which constitute his
    first efforts at printmaking.<br><br>Boyle-Turner notes that, "Desperate for
    money during this period, according to Bernard, Gauguin tried to sell his
    prints even before they were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle.  He
    may well have seen these prints not only as an intriguing experiment with a
    new technique but also as a way to generate interest in his paintings and to
    earn a little money.  They were almost a prospectus showing the variety of
    images he had produced over the years. The motifs he chose reveal his own
    preferences for at least some of his paintings," (The Prints of the
    Pont-Aven School, New York, 1989, page 36).<br><br>Despite Gauguin's efforts
    to promote the Café Volpini exhibition and sell his first lithographs, the
    exhibition was a financial failure.  Not a single one of the 100 plus works
    exhibited by any of the artists was sold.  Gauguin produced only two further
    lithographs after the Volpini series, opting instead to turn to woodcuts in
    1894.  Kornfeld 2.

    Woodcut on Chine volant, 1893-94. 205x355 mm; 8⅛x14 inches, full margins.
    Fourth state (of 4).  Artist's proof in this state, likely a lifetime
    impression, aside from the edition of 100.  Printed before 1904, after the
    Roy edition of 1894 and before the Pola Gauguin edition of 100 published in
    1921, before the significant vertical and horizontal cracks in the block
    which are evident in the 1921 edition.<br><br>Aside from early proofs like
    this printed in black and the color impressions printed by Gauguin himself,
    Kornfeld notes two impressions of other Noa Noa subjects printed before 1904
    by Tony or Jacques Beltrand for Eugène Druet (Kornfeld 20 and 22). 
    According to Kornfeld, Eugène Druet acquired 8 of the Noa Noa wood blocks
    sometime around 1914-18 and had Beltrand print impressions.  In 1921, Druet
    sold the wood blocks to the artist's son, Pola Gauguin, and he produced the
    edition of 100 impressions of each. The Pola Gauguin printings, as well as
    many of the Beltrand impressions, are evidenced by the splits in the blocks
    (which are particularly noticeable in the 1921 impressions).<br><br>The
    current impression predates these Beltrand and Pola Gauguin impressions.  A
    superb, richly-inked impression of this extremely scarce woodcut.  Kornfeld

    own technique which he called "printed drawings" in which he coated a sheet
    of paper with ink (manipulated by keeping it wet or allowing it to dry),
    laid an uninked sheet on top of it, then drew on the top second sheet,
    causing the back of the sheet to be pressed into the ink where marks were
    made.  Gauguin considered the inked image to be the artwork, and not the
    original drawing. As in the current work, he made additions in pencil to the
    inked work.

    was educated in Munich at the Kunstgewerbeschule and the Akademie der
    Bildenden Künste, training in both fine and applied arts.  He stepped away
    from his academic training, using a traditional style but portraying
    haunting, symbolic scenes relating to psychology, sexuality and
    spirituality. The female figure bound by a snake is a repeated motif,
    present in paintings like The Sin, 1893, now at the Neue Pinakothek, Munich,
    Inferno, 1908, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and an oil
    version of the current lot, Die Sinnlichkeit, or The Sensuality sold

    began making etchings and drypoints in 1915 with the help of fellow artist
    Martin Lewis (1881-1962), and he produced 70 prints before he ceased etching
    in 1928 to focus solely on painting. Night Shadows is a particularly iconic
    image, epitomizing Hopper's propensity for conveying isolation and stillness
    through the use of heavy chiaroscuro and strong, dark hatching throughout.
    He used a bird's-eye vantage point with extended shadows and darkness to
    intensify the suspense and drama.<br><br>The artist depicted this same
    street corner in a painting from 1913, Corner Saloon, now in The Museum of

    early, very  scarce lithograph.<br><br>We have found only two other
    impressions at auction in the past 30 years.<br><br>Hartley (1877-1943) was
    a member of the "Stieglitz Group," under the patronage of the famed
    gallerist and early champion of modern art in America, Alfred Stieglitz
    (1864-1946) who arranged the artist's first solo exhibition in 1909 at his
    291 Gallery in New York.  This was a major turning point in Hartley's
    career; through Stieglitz he met and became influenced by other emerging
    artists such as Charles Demuth (1883-1935), Arthur Dove (1880-1946), John
    Marin (1870-1953) and Georgia O'Keeffe (1887-1986).<br><br>Growing up in
    Maine and Cleveland, Hartley showed promise as a young artist and was funded
    by an art patron to study in New York in 1899.  He studied with William
    Merritt Chase (1849-1916) at his New York School and at the National Academy
    of Design.  But it was not until he gained the support of Stieglitz and the
    artist Arthur B. Davies (1862-1928), a senior member of the Stieglitz
    circle, that he was able to travel to Paris.  In France, Hartley closely
    studied the Post-Impressionist and Cubist masterpieces and experimented in
    these styles.  From Paris, he traveled through Europe and arrived in
    Berlin.  Adopting a bold new style, Hartley exhibited with the avant-garde
    Der Blaue Reiter group in 1913.  He revisited Berlin in 1914, producing his
    most iconic works of the War Motif series, following the death of his
    purported romantic partner, a German World War I soldier named Karl von
    Freyburg.  These paintings are comprised of bold, sweeping colors, German
    insignia and undulating flattened shapes.<br><br>Ingenious and innovative,
    Hartley drew from the two-dimensionality of the Cubists and the
    spiritualism, raw emotion and subjectivity of the Expressionists. Hartley
    traveled around the world throughout his career, often deeply embedding
    himself in his surroundings.  His works slowly became less abstract as his
    career advanced.  University of Kansas 4.

    richly-inked, luminous impression of this important print, with all the
    details distinct.<br><br>According to McCarron, "The location depicted
    appears to be the intersection of Thirty-Fourth Street and Park Avenue,
    looking west." Lewis has captured the bright summer sun setting across the
    Hudson River, its raking light forming long shadows from the figures walking
    east across Park Avenue.<br><br>Among Lewis's (1881-1962) most masterful
    prints are those depicting scenes of New York City life.  These prints have
    historical interest, as the imagery captures the architecture and styles of
    the time, while simultaneously incorporating ephemeral moments.  The time of
    day, the weather, the lighting, the street-level views— each aspect was
    important and added to the atmosphere of the scene.  Lewis's use of shadows
    and light to create mood, life and movement is most powerful in his New York
    prints. Shadow Dance is among his most celebrated works, incorporating all
    of the aspects that make his prints such cherished glimpses into New York's
    bustling yester-year, while simultaneously capturing the timelessness of
    city life.  McCarron 88.

    painting, Picasso's first series of etchings in 1905, generally known as La
    Suite des Saltimbanques, and created at the outset of his career at only 24
    years old, are mostly candid representations of the lives and private
    moments of acrobats and gypsies.  Picasso frequently attended the Cirque
    Médrano in Montmartre, Paris, near his studio.  As a young artist, he was
    drawn to the bohemian lifestyle of the circus folk, their freedom of
    expression and their declassé subculture.  Bloch 12; Geiser 14.

    St. Raphael is based on a gouache painting from a series of works Picasso
    (1881-1973) made during a trip with his then new wife, the Russian ballet
    dancer, Olga Khokhlova, to Saint-Raphaël, a small town popular with British
    holiday makers situated on the French Riviera between Cannes and Saint
    Tropez.  Here the newly married couple stayed in the elegant Hôtel
    Continental et des Bains. Their room and balcony looked out over the
    sparkling Mediterranean, and it was this setting that inspired Picasso to
    begin a series of elegant domestic still-lifes in pencil, gouache and
    watercolor that featured a table placed in front of the open hotel window.

    important lithograph.<br><br>Picasso (1881-1973) called Françoise Gilot
    (born 1921), his muse and mistress from 1943 to 1953 and the mother of their
    children, Claude and Paloma, "The Woman Who Says No," as she alone among his
    many lovers dared to defy him and ultimately left him in the south of
    France.  Françoise was born to a wealthy family in Neuilly-sur-Seine, her
    father was a businessman and her mother was an amateur artist. From an early
    age, Françoise yearned to be an artist like her mother, but her father
    forced her into studying law, which she ultimately abandoned after several
    failed attempts to resist her father's control, by 1942 devoting her life to
    becoming an artist.<br><br>When their relationship began the following year
    she was 21--a neophyte in the art world--Picasso, who had just turned 61
    years old, was among the most famous living artists alive at the time. 
    Gilot put her artistic pursuits on hold (she eventually returned to them and
    established herself as an artist with some success from the 1960s onward) in
    place of raising their two children.  She and Picasso fought frequently
    however, and by the early 1950s their relationship had dissolved, she
    separated from the artist and their home in the south of France and
    relocated with their children to Paris.<br><br>In this lithograph, from a
    series of 11 different versions Picasso made during June 1946, Picasso shows
    her with characteristic narrow, arching eyebrows, full lips and youthful
    visage.  Picasso's old friend Henri Matisse, who was fond of Gilot and found
    artistic inspiration in her feminine beauty as well, remarked that he would
    paint her with a pale blue body and leaf-green hair, which prompted Picasso
    to create La Femme-Fleur, 1946, another famous portrait of Françoise,
    hyper-stylized with a pale blue body and leaves for hair.  Bloch 399;

    Published by Avalun Verlag, Vienna.  A very good impression of this scarce
    lithograph. <br><br>Albert Paris von Gütersloh (1887-1973) was an Austrian
    artist, actor, and producer, and friend of Schiele (1890-1918).  Gütersloh
    wrote the first study of Schiele's art in 1911 and became the subject of
    several of Schiele's portraits. <br><br>This lithograph was commissioned by
    the Gesellschaft für vervielfältigende Kunst on March 6, 1918, though it was
    rejected on April 27 in favor of Mädchen (see Kallir 17).  The few Bildnis
    Paris von Gütersloh impressions sold were stamped with the artist's name and
    date and numbered.  Eighty impressions of the 125 edition were included in
    the portfolio Das Graphische Werk von Egon Schiele, published by Rikola
    Verlag, Vienna, in 1922 and bear the artist's signature stamp.  Unsold

    University of Massachusetts Boston's art department; thence by descent to
    the current owner, private collection New York.<br><br>The current
    impression of Der Verliebte, or The Lover was a gift from Alfred H.  Barr,
    Jr. to the art critic and founder of University of Massachusetts Boston's
    art department, Renee M. Arb, with whom he had a close relationship during
    the 1940s and 1950s.  At the time of this gift, Arb had helped launch the
    career of painter de Kooning, capturing the essence of his artistic
    trajectory, and inducing Barr to begin acquiring the artist's work for the
    MoMA.  During her career, at ARTnews, Dr. Arb was credited with being the
    first to acknowledge Willem de Kooning's work in 1948 in what his wife
    Elaine de Kooning recalled as a "prophetic" review of the artist's first
    solo exhibition in New York.  Kornfeld 94.

    lithographer was greatly facilitated by his ongoing artistic collaboration
    with the master-printer Charles Sorlier of the Atelier Mourlot, Paris.
    Though Chagall made lithographs as early as the 1920s, his lithographic work
    blossomed from the 1950s onward, under the guidance of Sorlier. Sorlier
    became so familiar with Chagall's work (and Chagall relied on Sorlier's
    judgment to such an extent) that Sorlier created a number of prints in a
    style "after" Chagall, as interpretive designs of Chagall's original
    paintings and gouaches.  Sorlier 96.

    of Delft.  From 1919 to 1922, Escher attended the Haarlem School of
    Architecture and Decorative Arts, learning drawing and the art of making
    woodcuts.  He briefly studied architecture, but he failed a number of
    subjects and switched to decorative arts.<br><br>In 1922, a watershed year
    of his life, Escher traveled through Italy, visiting Florence, San
    Gimignano, Volterra, Siena and Ravello.  In the same year, he traveled
    through Spain, visiting Madrid, Toledo and Granada.  He was impressed by the
    Italian countryside and, in Granada, by the Moorish architecture of the
    fourteenth-century Alhambra palace.  The intricate decorative designs of the
    Alhambra, based on geometrical symmetries featuring interlocking repetitive
    patterns in the colored tiles or sculpted into the walls and ceilings,
    triggered his interest in the mathematics of tessellation (tiling with a
    repeated pattern) and became a powerful influence on his work.<br><br>Escher
    returned to Italy and lived in Rome from 1923 to 1935.  While in Italy, he 
    met Jetta Umiker--a Swiss woman, like himself attracted to Italy--whom he
    married in 1924.  The couple settled in Rome where their first son, Giorgio
    (George) Arnaldo Escher, named after his grandfather, was born.  Escher and
    Jetta later had two more sons--Arthur and Jan.<br><br>During the following
    decade, he traveled frequently, visiting (among other places) Viterbo in
    1926, the Abruzzi in 1927 and 1929, Corsica in 1928 and 1933, Calabria in
    1930, the Amalfi coast in 1931 and 1934, and Gargano and Sicily in 1932 and
    1935. The townscapes and landscapes of these places feature prominently in
    his artworks, including the current lithograph and the proceeding six lots. 
    In May and June 1936, Escher travelled back to Spain, revisiting the
    Alhambra and spending days at a time making detailed drawings of its mosaic
    patterns. It was here that he became fascinated, to the point of obsession,
    with tessellation, explaining, "It remains an extremely absorbing activity,
    a real mania to which I have become addicted, and from which I sometimes
    find it hard to tear myself away."  Bool 137.

    extremely scarce lithograph.<br><br>According to Bool, when Escher traveled
    to Calabria, Italy, from April 28 to May 25, 1930, during which time he drew
    the current view, he was accompanied by a fellow artist friend, Roberto
    Schiess, who brought with him a zither to entertain the local people, and
    Jean Roussert, a young French historian, who dragged along with him a large
    camera.  From Rome they took the train to Pizzo and followed the coast
    south, Bool continues, "As soon as they left the main road and entered the
    impoverished inland districts, they had to use mule tracks or dried-up river
    beds [to traverse the land].  From Pizzo they went via Tropea and Scilla to
    the southernmost tip of Calabria, Mélito.  Here the trip began in earnest
    with a long walk along a river-bed to reach Pentedattilo, where they spent a
    few days.  The first day Escher began drawing there, a praying mantis jumped
    onto his folder and stayed there immobile for such a long time that he was
    able to use it as a model.  Five years later this praying mantis found an
    appropriate place in the wood engraving Dream.  Bool 139.

    octahedra (a polyhedron with eight faces) used for the central cage in Stars
    had been studied before in mathematics, and Escher (1898-1972) likely
    learned of it from the book Vielecke und Vielflache by Max Brückner.  Escher
    used similar compound polyhedral forms in several other works, including
    Crystal1947, Study for Stars, 1948, Double Planetoid, 1949 and Waterfall,
    1961.<br><br>The design for Stars was likely influenced by Escher's own
    interest in both geometry and astronomy, by a long history of using
    geometric forms to model the heavens, and by a drawing style used by
    Leonardo da Vinci.  Commentators have interpreted the cage's compound shape
    as a reference to double and triple stars in astronomy, or to twinned
    crystals in crystallography.  The image contrasts the celestial order of its
    polyhedral shapes with the more chaotic forms of biology.  Bool 359.

    mezzotint due to its tonal range, and printed eight editions in the medium
    between 1946 and 1951.  Like many of Escher’s perceptually dizzying but
    impeccably calculated images, this black-and-white composition of
    interlocking fish, fowl, primitive nudes, and mythical beasts can be read in
    several ways.  Its light and dark contrasts form an overall geometrical
    pattern, like a chessboard run amok, or a jigsaw puzzle writhing with

    Bosch’s Renaissance-era views of the underworld, but Escher’s

    are only relative concepts."  The lithograph Relativity is one such image in
    which these concepts prove to be interchangeable.  Relativity also depicts a
    world in which the normal laws of gravity do not apply.  The architectural
    structure seems to be the center of an idyllic community, with most of its
    inhabitants casually going about their ordinary business, such as dining. 
    There are windows and doorways leading to park-like outdoor settings.  All
    of the figures are dressed in identical attire and have featureless
    bulb-shaped heads.  In the world of Relativity, there are three sources of
    gravity, each being orthogonal to the two others.  Each inhabitant lives in
    one of the gravity wells, where normal physical laws apply.  There are
    sixteen characters, spread between each gravity source, six in one and five
    each in the other two.  The apparent confusion of the lithograph comes from
    the fact that the three gravity sources are depicted in the same space.

    painted white, which was a gift from his friend Professor Jan Arnoldus
    Schouten, a Dutch mathematician at the Delft University of Technology,
    inspired Escher (1898-1972) to create Convex and Concave.  When it is viewed
    with one eye, the image of the staircase conjured up in the brain constantly
    changes.  "When carefully studied, this print is a visual nightmare.  At
    first glance, it seems to be a symmetrical structure: the left half is an
    approximate mirror image of the right half and the transition from left to
    right is gradual and very natural.  Nevertheless something terrible happens
    at the transition in the center: everything is literally turned inside out. 
    The top becomes the bottom, the front becomes the back.  People, lizards and
    flowerpots rebel against the inversion; we identify them too clearly with
    tangible realities of which we do not know the inside-out form.  But they,
    too, have to pay the price when they cross the borderline: their relation to
    the environment becomes so strange that looking at them makes you feel
    dizzy.  For example, at the bottom left a man is climbing onto a platform by
    a ladder.  He sees a small temple in front of him.  He could stand next to
    the sleeping man and wake him up to ask why the shell-shaped pool in the
    middle is empty.  Then he could go to the stairs on the right with the
    intention of walking up them.  But it is already too late!  What looked like
    stairs seen from the left, has suddenly turned into part of an arched
    vault.  He would notice that the platform, which was once firm ground under
    his feet, is now a ceiling, and he would crash down with a terrified
    scream.  The border line between the left and right half cannot be crossed
    without danger."  Bool 399.

    numbered "No. 42/52 II" in pencil, lower left. A superb, richly-inked
    impression with strong contrasts.<br><br>According to Xu, "The built-up
    tension within the couple confused and frustrated Escher.  In 1956, he
    created the lithograph, Bond of Union, possibly as a way to express the
    complex feelings of his relationship.<br><br>In the print, the heads of
    Escher and Jetta [his wife] are represented and broken up into one connected
    strap.  The two heads are hovering in the void, surrounded by floating
    bubble-like globes.  The facial expression is pensive, almost sad.  It looks
    as if although the two figures are connected and inseparable, as their
    personalities are disintegrating and getting dissolved into the void.  In a
    1968 interview, Escher claimed this piece to be merely an experiment to show
    the concept of endlessness and a reaction to sculpture.  However, he also
    wrote about this print, 'Like an endless bond, even their foreheads are
    woven together, they form an inseparable entity. Whether these two are glad
    to be bound as a family together, I cannot tell. It is a perilous
    undertaking, and they look a little sad.'<br><br>This is one of the rare
    portraits Escher made after World War II.  However, this piece is
    significantly different from his portraits of himself and of Jetta made more
    than thirty years earlier.  The same faces now appear reserved and
    indifferent.  The figures are facing towards each other but there is no
    shared eye contact, almost as if the couple is avoiding each other. 
    Escher’s facial expression, contrary to his confident look shown in the
    early self-portrait, seems troubled and tired," (The Hidden Emotions in M.C.

    captures an impossible shape, in this instance the view of a cube from below

    (1898-1972) was influenced by Giovanni B. Piranesi's (1720-1778) Carceri
    d'Invenzione series of etchings of fantastic, otherworldly prison scenes
    from the mid-1700s.<br><br>Bool notes, "It looks as though the top floor of
    the belvedere is straight on top of the floor below.  This impression is
    reinforced by the woman and the man on the right.  They are exactly one
    above the other, but they are looking in different directions, at right
    angles to each other.  There is something strange about the eight pillars
    joining the floors.  Only those at the extreme right and the extreme left
    behave in a normal fashion; the other six join the front to the back and
    must therefore run diagonally across the middle story . . . If we cut the
    print horizontally across where the pillars seem to cross over, the two
    halves would be perfectly normal: it is a matter of making impossible
    connections, as in the case of the cuboid which the young man is holding in
    his hands contemplatively."  Bool 426.
