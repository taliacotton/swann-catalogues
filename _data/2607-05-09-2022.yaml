    published in this period nonetheless informed heavily the work of young and

    of Bartons. [...] Some of these descendants, being both wealthy & elegant,
    may have made the gift, but I have never given away an old time family

    Women wore monocles to quietly identify as gay within the community, thus
    the name of the club. The Nazi occupation of Paris forced le Monocle to
    close its doors in the 1940s, but it did re-open after the war on Boulevard
    Edgar Quinet, with a monocle-shaped facade. (cf.

    make t-shirts for Croy's cause; [together with] a white t-shirt newly
    printed from the silkscreen; signs of use, old ink.<br><br>Norma Jean Croy
    was convicted of the pre-meditated murder of a police officer and sentenced
    to life in prison based on a racially charged incident in Yreka, California
    in 1978. An argument at a convenience store escalated to a melee at a
    private home in the course of which the police discharged more than 200
    rounds, and a small group of young Shasta-Karok Native Americans fired three
    bullets. Croy and her brother were both shot by the police. Her brother
    returned fire, killing a police officer instantly with one shot. Norma Jean
    never handled any weapons. Nonetheless, she was convicted and jailed. Judge
    Edward Stern, who presided over Croy's brother's appeal in 1991 noted, "I
    think that when Norma Jean Croy comes up for a parole hearing again, [...]
    the parole board should take into consideration the fact that this court
    believes that had Norma Jean Croy been tried in the case I heard, [she]
    would have been found not guilty. [...] I want the record to be clear that
    this is my judgment, my opinion, having heard the evidence in this case."
    Croy was finally exonerated and released from prison in 1997, after being
    wrongly incarcerated for eighteen years. In the 1990s, Croy's cause, often
    alongside that of Leonard Peltier, was featured by a number of social
    justice groups working to free wrongly convicted Indigenous Native
    Americans. This silkscreen is proof of the insistent grassroots activism
    that helped keep her case in the public eye.

    along with her sisters, established a pro-Union literary society in their
    town of Waterford, VA before the Civil War broke out. Empowered by parents
    who believed in the education of girls, free-thinking, and Quaker precepts,
    they started a political newspaper to express their views at the outbreak of
    the war. While only in their early twenties, they were forced to smuggle the
    manuscript material that they composed over the Potomac River to Baltimore,
    where a friend of their father's printed up The Waterford News. They
    published eight issues of the paper between 28 May 1864 and April of 1865,
    even expressing dismay in print at Grant's assault on their town. "We do not
    believe, if our Government had been as well acquainted with us as we are
    with ourselves, the order for the recent burning would have been issued; but
    having suffered so much at the hands of the Rebels since the commencement of
    this cruel war, we will cheerfully submit to what we feel assured our
    Government thought a military necessity."

    showing Earhart after the crash listening to General Yount with a serious

    verso by O.H. [Otto Hickman] Hornung, Jr. of Honolulu; each photo mounted on
    black paper album pages with typed captions; sizes vary, all but one nicely
    preserved.<br><br>On 20 March 1937, in an attempt to complete the second leg
    of her flight around the world, Earhart, along with three crew members,
    attempted to take off from Luke Field on Ford Island in her Lockheed Electra
    10E. Unfortunately, the runway was slick with rain and Earhart's attempt to
    correct a slight swing to the left turned into an out of control ground
    loop. Supported for a run of 50-60 feet on only the right wheel, the
    landing-gear on that side suddenly collapsed, followed rapidly by a collapse
    of the same gear on the left. Sliding on its belly in a shower of sparks,
    the plane sustained extensive damage, although the pilot and her crew
    emerged without injury. Plane and pilot boarded the SS Lurline headed back
    to Lockheed in Burbank for repairs.<br><br>Hornung Jr. clearly took some of
    these photographs, although the identity of the album compiler is otherwise
    undetermined. Several of the images viewable online concerning this incident
    are identical to those here. Other similar images were taken at the same
    time. All may share the same origin.  Barton Kyle Yount (1884-1949), a
    decorated U.S. Army Air Forces Lieutenant General, commanded Army Air Forces
    Training Command and served in the first and second world wars. In 1937 he
    was stationed at Hickham Field, Hawaii. In the image where Yount is speaking
    to Earhart, he is visible only from the back, leading this cataloguer to
    believe that the compiler of the album must have been present or informed by
    someone present in order to identify him. (For more see:

    Ranch (1860-1938) was born in Denmark and moved to Sweden with her family at
    the age of ten. Her father was a photographer but passed the business of
    capturing images to Mathilda when she was twenty-two years old. In addition
    to working in studio portraiture and landscapes, Ranch was also a
    photojournalist. Local newspapers relied on her images of fairs and
    attractions, royal visits, and disasters like train derailments. She was
    also an active feminist whose favorite motto of solidarity was "Kvinnor
    Kan," which means Women Can.

    stretcher verso, with the "Salon Ruth Francken" estate ink stamp, on the
    stretcher, 32 1/2 x 48 in.<br><br>Born in Prague and exiled in Vienna during
    the interwar years, Francken studied painting with Arthur Segal beginning in
    1939 at the Ruskin School in Oxford, England, and lived in New York from
    1940 to 1950. She became an American citizen in 1942, and took classes at
    the Art Students League before settling in Paris in 1952. Francken is
    generally considered an Abstract Expressionist, though her later work also
    focused on sculpture, collage of different textiles with related techniques
    and furniture design. Her work from the late 1960s to the early 1970s is
    marked by an obsession with technology, as in this series of photo-metallic
    reliefs and collages. While sometimes included among the Pop artists for
    these 1960s/1970s works, the over-arching interest of much of her creative
    output is the association of industrial language and its conflictual
    relationship with fine art.

    gaining recognition within an art world that had become greatly diversified
    in style, subject, and materials. The art of Mary Frank resists easy
    categorization and, at first glance, seems outside the mainstream of late
    twentieth century art. Her choice of hand-built clay as her medium for fine
    art sculpture and her exploration of the interconnectedness of the natural
    world and humanity through the imagery of the body set her apart."

    the ceramic sculptures that she started making in the early 1970s, despite
    having had no previous experience in the medium. (She also worked at home
    and had no kiln, she told me in a recent phone interview, and so had to
    carry her fragile pieces down the hall of her apartment building, “past the
    baby carriages and kids on skates, down the elevator and get [them] in the
    truck” and off to be fired.) In addition to the Everson’s work, there are
    several other wonderful examples at the Dorsky, including the poignant
    Arching Woman (ca. 1972), a mere drape of clay that somehow manages to
    summon Bernini’s Saint Teresa in Ecstasy, and Three Dancers (1981), which
    finds an ideal midpoint between the serene choreography of Tang Dynasty tomb
    figures and the muscular figuration of Auguste Rodin." (Quoted from Glenn

    soldier three years in the army of the United States and received an
    honorable discharge therefrom. This extraordinary woman enlisted as a male
    by the name of Robert Shirtliff; and as such did her duty without a stain on
    her virtue or honor. She only prays, in her petition, for the payment of her
    arrears; but submits the circumstances of her services to the consideration
    of the legislature." (cf. pages 142-143).<br><br>Gannett was wounded in
    battle, and unwilling to allow a doctor to remove two bullets from her leg,
    for fear her gender would be revealed, dug one out herself (penknife &
    sewing needle), while the other stayed lodged in her thigh for the rest of
    her life. Paul Revere wrote on her behalf requesting a proper military
    pension in 1804. Congress approved the request and put Gannett on the
    pension roll in 1805.

    ingeniously, interested us from the very beginning, and the interest did not

    Ruskin, with their delicate touches of colour and the exquisite pencil

    simplicity, they rarely fail to realise the exact degree of beauty or of
    character intended"--page 540.<br><br>Greenaway began a correspondence with
    Oxford Professor and art critic Ruskin in 1880 when he wrote to compliment
    her on her drawings. The two developed a long and close friendship until

    talent and acclaim. Her publisher, Edmund Evans, hired poet Frederick
    Locker-Lampson to assist Greenaway with her verse writing. The two became
    close and Locker-Lampson, wealthy and well-connected, eventually began to
    help her enter London society in order to make beneficial introductions and
    promote her work to an affluent market. Commissions to paint the portraits
    of wealthy European patrons’ children soon followed, as well as invitations
    to display her paintings at the Royal Academy. This delicate portrait of a
    young girl may very likely have been one such portrait.

    Manuscript Diary of Several Voyages Including an Overland Trip to
    California, and a Climbing Trip to Mount Shasta, 1872-1873.
  TYPESET: >-
    12mo format manuscript on wove lined paper, consisting of a single signature
    of 40 pages, inscribed densely in pencil throughout, approximately 3,500
    words, outlining three different trips taken while the writer was a single
    woman.<br><br>The first recounting a journey of August 22-September 10, 1872
    from Sterne's home in St. Louis, MO toward Lake Superior by way of Chicago,
    IL; Escanaba, Michigan; Ishpeming, MI; Duluth, MN; Hinckley, MN; Green Bay,
    WI: Oconomowoc, WI; Minneapolis, MN; Fort Snelling; Milwaukee, WI, and back
    to St. Louis, traveling by train and boat primarily, with mention of
    successful post-fire rebuilding going on in Chicago, a trip to a peat mine,
    the Calumet copper mine, and an iron blast furnace.<br><br>The second trip
    June 13-21, 1873 from St. Louis to Council Bluffs, IA; Omaha, NE; Cheyenne,
    WI; Salt Lake City, UT; and Carson City, NV (where they stayed at the
    Glenbrook House); on this journey, Sterne and her party took the Union
    Pacific Rail Road past such sights as Echo Canyon, Castle Rock, Pulpit Rock,
    the Devil's Slide and Devil's Gates; she observed "Indians" at the train
    station shooting arrows for the amusement of passengers, women with
    "papooses" and Indian girls giggling; the visit to Salt Lake City included a
    guided visit to the Mormon Tabernacle with much information regarding the
    organ; a drive past "Mr. Young's house"; some visits to a Crown Point mine
    and the mint in Carson City; Sterne concludes this section with the
    observation, "This is a nice place, and we don't mind staying here a
    while."<br><br>The third trip is very interesting, it begins in San
    Francisco on August 6, 1873, after departing the city by rail, observing
    Alcatraz, Angel, and Marco's Islands, they pass by San Pablo Bay, the
    Straits of Carquinez, and then Suisun, stopping at Benicia, CA; Stockton;
    and Sacramento; followed by a somewhat harrowing stage coach ride from
    Redding, CA to Shasta.<br><br>"Then came packing of the human freight, nine
    inside five outside, stage a Concord coach, very hard, dusty, close,
    dreadful"; when they arrived they were first informed that at least one of
    their party's bed "would have to be made with a pitchfork," although Sterne
    ultimately found hers on a parlor sofa; from there the party departed for
    Mount Shasta on horseback with three Native Americans to help with the
    horses and camping baggage, they rode to a camp and ate grouse cooked on a
    campfire and slept directly on the ground.<br><br>The following day at 6:00
    am Sterne and party began the ascent of the mountain, a peak first climbed
    by a woman in 1856; she describes the mouth of the crater, and the
    "perfectly blue" water within; after lunch and drinking snowmelt, Sterne
    goes with "the gentleman" to see the Whitney Glacier.<br><br>"Then after a
    while Mr. S. came to see if we [the women] would go too. I went with him,
    alone, the others preferring not to go. I felt very fully repaid for a climb
    to the tip top & a walk of 1/2 mile over a ridge of snow. [I] saw the
    Whitney Glacier. It is very beautiful, castles & spires & diamonds of snow
    on the side & the main body all cracked & broken with both wide and narrow
    channels."<br><br>Sterne also describes the amazing view of the lakes and
    mountains of the Shasta Valley; the last entry in the diary is dated Monday
    18 [August, 1873], "reached here tired & dirty & hungry."<br><br>Some
    staining to contents, in card-weight paper wrappers with a hole punched in
    the top corner and a loop of string tied through it, 5 1/2 x 3 1/2
    in.<br><br>As is so often the case, we know more about Sterne's husband,
    Edwin Harrison, than we do of Sterne herself. Although this journal was
    written before she was married (13 November 1873), we may surmise she was in
    the company of her future husband, mainly because of the heavy interest in
    mining and metals, his career. Others she calls "cousins" but that could
    mean anything. What comes down to us is an interesting journal of an
    intrepid young woman whose life is under-recorded. Biographies of her
    husband mention that she was at one time the president of the Missouri State
    Federation of Women's Clubs and that she had three children.

    women, including goodies, maids, sweeps, and biddies. These positions were
    eliminated when the university suspected that they might demand higher
    wages, at which time the school turned to its own students to clean up after

  TYPESET: >-
    Wove bifolium inscribed over three pages to friend and author Mrs. Lydia
    Maria Child (1802-1880), regarding Child's written accounts of Hosmer's
    celebrated sculpture, Zenobia, and her monumental sculpture of Thomas Hart
    Benton, and her plans to travel to St. Louis in the near future; 9 3/4 x 8
    in. when unfolded.<br><br>[Together with] a brief note signed by Hosmer in
    1895 on stationery from The Ledge, Bar Harbor, Maine. (2)<br><br>Living a
    life that seems barely possible for her time, Hosmer began in Watertown,
    Massachusetts under daunting circumstances. Her mother died when Hosmer was
    six, she lost her two little brothers in 1834 & 1835, and her older sister
    died when Harriet was only twelve. All of this loss seems to have encouraged
    her father, a physician, to raise his only remaining child to survive.
    Hosmer was encouraged to row, ride horses, ice skate, and draw. She traveled
    alone in the wilderness of the western United States, and visited the Dakota
    Indians. Women were not allowed to attend medical classes, but she impressed
    family friend Dr. Joseph Nash McDowell of the Missouri Medical College, who
    invited her to study human anatomy. Hosmer mentions two of her most famous
    sculptures in this letter, Zenobia, and the ten-foot bronze of Thomas Hart
    Benton made for Lafayette Park in St. Louis, MO.<br><br>In addition to
    championing Hosmer's work in print, Child was also active in
    transcendentalist and abolitionist circles, a supporter of women's rights,
    and a Native American rights activist, who opposed American expansionism. In
    a letter written to Hosmer on 16 September 1860, perhaps in response to
    Hosmer's letter here, Child wrote, "I hope you won't get into a fight with
    any of your rivals and settle the question with Bowie knives and revolvers,
    Missouri fashion. I can send you a Bowie knife bearing the motto, 'Death to
    Abolitionists,' if you want it, but Bowie knives won't kill us. God bless
    you, dear little Ruffian!"

    in Berkeley as a young person and graduated with a Ph.D. in philosophy from
    the University of California in 1896. Precise information regarding La
    Barraque's attendance at Hastings is spotty as all of the school's records
    were destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the fires that
    followed it. This survival is notable, and provides better information about
    the time of her attendance. Also remembered as a professional singer and
    advocate for the rights of people with blindness and other challenges, La
    Barraque served for some time as president of the San Francisco Workers for
    the Blind, and sang at performances to benefit charities supporting the
    blind including an event where Helen Keller was in attendance, and on the
    same bill at another show that was headlined by Mark Twain.

    in Leighton's series of six wood engravings illustrating different aspects
    of the work involved in timber harvesting. The series grew out of her
    observations at the Canadian International Paper Company's lumber camp in
    the Laurentian Mountains of Quebec, which she visited in the winter of
    1930-31 during one of a series of lecture tours she undertook in America
    before emigrating there permanently in 1939. Leighton engraved her designs
    on wood blocks from sketches made on site. Notwithstanding the remote
    setting that inspired the series, its theme of bodily toil is consistent
    with Leighton's many prints of English rural life. Her series echoes the
    concerns of many American artists during the 1930s, when the poverty and
    unemployment of the Great Depression inspired glorification of the ordinary
    worker, as in the prints of James Edward Allen, Gifford Beal, and Benton
    Murdoch Spruance, who, like Leighton, used a serial format to portray work
    in a narrative fashion." (cf. The Terra Foundation for American Art's online

    de la Asunción (1555-1630), who founded the first Catholic monastery in
    Manila in 1621.<br><br>In the spring of 1620, at the age of sixty-six,
    Jerónima and six nuns traveled from Toledo to Seville, the first leg of the
    very long journey to the Philippines. In Seville, Velázquez painted a
    stunning full-length portrait of her. They departed from Cádiz by boat,
    arrived at Veracruz, and then traveled overland to Mexico City, finally
    arriving there in September. The group stayed in Mexico for six months with
    other sisters of the same order. From Mexico City in the spring of 1621,
    mules conveyed the nuns to Acapulco, where they set sail aboard the Spanish
    galleon San Andrés to the Philippines.<br><br>Madre Jerónima did not always
    see eye-to-eye with the male overseers of the convent, which was established
    exclusively for Spanish women, excluding Indigenous women. The conquistadors
    were concerned to see the pool of marriageable Spanish women in the
    Philippines shrinking as novices entered the convent. At the same time,
    native Filippino women who tried to join the order were denied, not by the
    convent and Madre Jerónima, but by the male Franciscan superiors. Her
    attempt to allow Doña María Uray of Dapitan to join was denied, as was her
    proposition that a separate convent be created for non-Spanish women in the
    late 1620s. However, in the years after Jerómina's death, the nuns of Santa
    Clara found a way to sneak Martha de San Bernardo into the order, with a
    little jurisdictional maneuvering.<br><br>According to Worldcat, the
    prologue contains a detailed description of the Pacific Ocean and navigation
    in the Far East, and of the Philippine Islands. Apparently wishing to
    suppress the navigational material, the Council ordered the prologue removed
    from all copies, but the suppression was ineffectual. The Prologo is present

    successfully promoted the idea that gardening was an appropriate hobby for
    young women through the publication of a number of books in the present

    that name. In 1827, at the age of seventeen, she anonymously published The
    Mummy!, in three volumes, which she describes as "a strange, wild novel" set
    in the twenty-second century.

    intended both for students and teachers. "The book represents a compilation
    of recipes that have been used in cooking schools of the country for many
    years. It is not designed for the use of experienced cooks who are seeking a
    wider variety and a great elaboration of recipes but for the young cook who
    desires to prepare simple dishes well." (Quoted from the author's
    introduction.) After her time at the Normal Institute, Lyford turned her
    attention to the study of traditional practical hand crafts of Native
    American Indians including those of the Sioux, Ojibwa, and Iroquois Nations.
    Beginning in 1929, she traveled extensively to Indian reservations in her
    work for the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

  CROSSHEAD: Autograph Manuscript of Lecture Notes.
  TYPESET: >-
    1880s.<br><br>Octavo-format lined journal originally used (barely) as an
    account book, repurposed by the author containing handwritten notes and
    clippings, occupying approximately 144 pages, easily legible and densely
    inscribed, on topics of Meriwether's various social causes for presentation
    in public lectures; black morocco boards, both detached, lacking spine, in
    need of resewing; pages somewhat wavy where clippings have been pasted, with
    occasional glue discoloration, a very good candidate for restoration, 8 1/2
    x 5 3/4 in.<br><br>Meriwether was a strong vocal advocate for women's rights
    whose work contributed substantially to the first wave of feminism. The
    platform of the Tennessee Woman's Christian Temperance Union, which she
    served as president from 1884 to 1897, included planks beyond those
    suggested by its name. Meriwether advocated for raising the age of sexual
    consent (which was ten years old), woman's suffrage, female education, equal
    pay, and equal rights under the law, to great success. She also actively
    recruited Black women to join the WCTU, and presided over interracial
    meetings of the group in Memphis in the 1880s.<br><br>In this manuscript,
    which begins with remarks for a speech delivered at the end of 1888,
    Meriwether's prepared text is interspersed with clippings to be read out
    loud in support of her points. For example, she includes a newspaper piece
    on a filthy dive bar downtown on Mulberry Street in New York City.
    Frequented by poor women who buy stale beer mixed with soda water, these
    "pitiable wrecks" would drink themselves into a stupor, and then sleep on
    the floor. Our orator includes it to drive home her point. Meriwether felt
    that women of privilege were complicit in the degraded status of their
    sisters when they fail to take political action. Without equal education,
    equal work opportunities, and equal pay, how can indigent women provide for
    themselves? She does not mince words. "Oh woman! living in comfortable ease!
    is it nothing to you that thousands of your sisters, hounded into the depths
    by poverty, ignorance, and licensed greed, are battling and sinking in these
    black waves of moral and social degradation and death?"<br><br>The talk that
    begins on page 37 of the current manuscript is titled, "Waste Not, Want
    Not," and is clearly written to address a Black audience. Meriwether writes
    in part, "I have always felt that our race owed to yours a peculiar debt of
    gratitude, the like of which has never been known in the history of any
    other nation." Raised in Virginia, she goes on to describe her warm feelings
    about the Black woman who tended and raised her from infancy, and then
    transitions into a description of the successes of people of color in the
    south. "I want to see you all prosperous, and happy, and good. I rejoice
    always to see schoolhouses going up for you. I love to see your nice
    churches, your comfortable schoolhouses, your kind, well-educated teachers,
    your honest, straightforward God fearing preachers. I love to go to your
    school examinations, and see your exhibitions, and to see how fast your
    children learn & how bright they are, and to hear them sing & play and to
    look at their pretty paintings & embroideries; and to know that they are
    improving their advantages and in time they will be useful & honorable men &
    women, a blessing and an honor to their parents, their country, & their
    race."

    twenty. Her travels yielded a number of works concerning the people and
    cultures of Portugal, Hungary, the Bosporus region, and Turkey. The present
    work, intended for a young audience, begins with a little girl, Mary Lawson,
    who should have been on her way to school. Her steps are arested when she
    sees a mutilated doll in a heap of trash on the street. Imagine Mary's
    astonishment when the doll begins to cry, and then offers to share her sad
    tale.

    Jersey.<br><br>Petersen (1915-2011) was born into an aristocratic German
    family south of Berlin.  While pursuing a career in the arts was not typical
    of young women born of her stature, her neighbor Max Liebermann (1847-1935)
    was impressed by her talent, and together they convinced her parents to
    allow her to study art.  She first studied with Willy Jaeckel (1888-1944)
    and then attended the Berlin Academy of Art studying with Karl Hofer
    (1878-1955).  With the onset of World War II, she moved to New York where
    she studied with Hans Hofman (1880-1966) and befriended Mercedes Matter
    (1913-2001) who introduced her to the artistic circles of New York. As she
    immersed herself in the Abstract Expressionist movement, she started
    exhibiting her work, including at the Betty Parsons Gallery in the 1960s and
    70s. A noted colorist, during her career she moved between abstract and
    figurative work. When her vision became impaired later in life making it
    difficult to differentiate color, she continued to paint, working
    exclusively in black and white.

    1669). She signed the engraved title for the Palazzi with the first initial
    of her birth name, adopting Isabella after she joined the Convent of Santa
    Croce in Venice in 1666. Thus, at the time she created the plate, she was
    nineteen years old.

    Legislative Assembly of the Territory, he writes, "The title of this bill is
    misleading. While it declares itself to be an act to prevent women from
    entering saloons for the purpose of drinking therein, it goes further, and
    prohibits them from going there to earn an honest livelihood, as many do.
    [...] This bill is not only useless legislation, but is legislation in a
    vicious direction, in that it presupposes that women are something less than
    rational beings as compared with men, and must be hedged about with
    statutory enactments to keep them from degradation and vice. [...] The
    spirit of the time and of our institutions, and the public policies of
    America combine to establish a broadening and elevating sphere for woman,
    and to make her the equal of man in all public and social rights before the
    law. She is no longer a toy, a slave, or a nonentity, but has become a
    moral, social, and political force--recognized as such everywhere."

    Emma Willard pioneered "female education" with her Troy Female Seminary in
    the fall of 1821. Even moves like Willard's were couched in the idea that
    what we now consider a normal college experience was not appropriate or even
    necessary for young women. In its 1855 report, the Rutgers Female Institute
    states that the committee reviewing students "was struck with one
    peculiarity [...] that natural quickness which characterizes the operations
    of the female mind [...] was carried into the close and difficult reasoning
    which they were called upon to employ [while solving mathematical problems
    in algebra, geometry, & trigonometry] with remarkable effect." Also noting
    that the students, "demonstrated a truth which had often been called in
    question, that the female mind is, by nature, perfectly adapted to these
    severe and logical studies."<br><br>Harriet St. John was born and raised in
    Lambertville, New Jersey. Little is known of her life after her time at

    Josiah Simpson (1815-1874) in 1849, together they had five children. She
    passed away while living in Baltimore, Maryland in 1862.

    late wife, Faith Trumbull Wadsworth (1769-1846), is also remembered in the
    letter. In closing, Sigourney asks after Elizabeth Mars Johnson Thomson
    (1807-1864), the African American missionary serving in Liberia who was born
    in Connecticut and had recently visited the state before returning to her
    work overseas.

    was exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show, where its content, a barely pubescent
    nude girl under the cloak of a leering older man in the process of offering
    her for sale, proved controversial. The juxtaposition of the nude female
    form as an object of exploitation did not suit the taste of many
    contemporary observers. St. Leger Eberle's studio was on New York's Lower
    East Side, and her subjects were predominantly the poor and working-class
    children who inhabited the neighborhood. She felt a personal responsibility
    as an artist to "see for people -- reveal them to themselves and each
    other."

    course of six days in July of 1867, Sotheby, Wilkinson & Hodge sold the
    largest private library of Anglophone women's writing, collected by Reverend
    Stainforth in the 19th century. The catalogue lists 7,122 titles in over
    8,000 volumes written and edited by more than 2,800 authors, almost all
    women. "Stainforth’s library rejects this patriarchal model and makes a
    political claim that women—struggling working mothers, women of color,
    disabled authors, translators, children, aged writers, Jews, incarcerated
    poets, printers, schoolteachers, women who co-author with their husbands,
    survivors of assault, hymnists, those who publish only a single poem, and
    more—have a valued place in book history and on the shelf. He collected
    works by women writers not only from Britain but from America, Australia,
    Canada, and Asia who published between 1546 and 1866. His project, according
    to his catalog, was to collect a copy of every edition of every title by
    women poets, dramatists, and nonfiction writers before his death in 1866."

    Nearly all of the Giant Women works feature a collaged photograph of
    Steckel’s face atop the oversized figures. In this array of visual metaphors

    graduate of City Hospital, a nurse at Blackwell, and Superintendent of
    Gouveneur Hospital from 1895 until 1921. In the early photo of the original
    Gouverneur Hospital buildings its famous horse-drawn ambulance is standing
    in readiness. In 1902, Dr. Emily Dunning Barringer (1876-1961) became the
    first woman ambulance physician at Gouverneur Hospital, which served the
    lower east side of New York. Circa 1894, when Stowers was stationed on the
    so-called "Welfare Island" i.e., Roosevelt Island, in the East River, it
    housed a notorious complex of workhouses which included a large central
    hospital, as well as an almshouse, a smallpox hospital, and a hospital
    designated for patients deemed "incurable" by the system, which included
    those suffering from mental and physical disabilities. Investigative
    reporter Nellie Bly infiltrated the Women's Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell
    Island in 1887, and wrote Ten Days in a Madhouse, an exposé on the inhumane
    conditions she found there.

    New Jersey.<br><br>Von Rebay was born into an aristocratic family in
    Strasbourg (at the time a part of Germany) and studied painting in Paris,
    Cologne and Munich.  In 1917, she moved to Berlin and was introduced to the
    avant-garde Galerie der Sturm, which was the center of the modern art scene
    in the city.  While in Berlin, she also met Rudolf Bauer (1889-1953), with
    whom she had a lifelong relationship.<br><br>Rebay was interested in
    non-objective art, a form of abstraction that was rooted in esoteric
    religious beliefs and philosophical ideas of intuition.  She believed this
    form of art was a cure for a world ravaged by war and the burgeoning
    technological innovations that fueled materialism.<br><br>In 1927, she moved
    to New York and was commissioned to paint Solomon Guggenheim's portrait. 
    She took the opportunity to encourage him to collect non-objective art and
    became instrumental in guiding Guggenheim's collection.  When he founded the
    Museum of Non-Objective Painting (now the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) in
    New York, she was the first curator and director of the museum and chose
    Frank Lloyd Wright to design the now iconic building.

    Three Autograph Letters Signed to Whitman from Gamaliel Lyman Dwight
    (1841-1875)
  TYPESET: >-
    Each letter a single wove bifolium transcribed over four pages and dated 1
    February 1862, 29 April 1862, and 28 August 1863; the first letter
    mentioning the Civil War and that Dwight is taking meals with a man who knew
    Poe, noting, "I intend to find out all that he knows about him and if I
    glean anything of interest will tell you"; the second written from Camp
    Winfield Scott outside of Yorktown, Virginia, where he is ten minutes' walk
    from the enemy camp, and stating in part, "I have taken laughing gas,
    alcohol, hash-heesh, and been frightened, but no excitement compares with
    artillery practice," and "A general with one arm just rode by. Very fine!";
    the final letter, written from the Headquarters of the Artillery Brigade,
    2nd Army Corps near Morrisville, VA, reports the execution of two deserters,
    and a turning of the tide, "What glorious news comes daily from Charleston!
    Next Chattanooga and Mobile, and Mr. Reb. must throw up the sponge. We're
    bound to hold the belt"; each about 9 x 7 unfolded. (3)<br><br>Whitman, not
    only a published poet in her own right, was also a friend of Margaret Fuller
    and part of the transcendentalist and spiritualist movement in New England.
    She had what can only be characterized as an intense relationship with Edgar
    Allan Poe which led to a near-marriage in 1849,  the same year of his death.
    Whitman donated the letters she received from Poe, along with his
    dagguereotype portrait the biographer, John Henry Ingram. This material is
    currently held at the Alderman Library at UVA. Colonel Dwight shared
    Whtiman's interest in Poe, and the two maintained a close relationship.

    London: by T. Plummer for R. Dutton, 1801.<br><br>First edition, three 12mo
    volumes, bound in very well preserved contemporary half green sheepskin with
    pink paste-paper boards, contents similarly good, 6 3/4 x 3 7/8
    in.<br><br>This very rare three volume epistolary novel, written by an
    author upon whom information is scant. Wingrove, who seems to have lived in
    the town of Bath, only published one other title, Letters Moral and
    Entertaining, in 1795, (found in three British libraries only). The
    Spinster's Tale, according to Worldcat, is held at only one location
    worldwide: the British Library. As was the case with novels written by and
    for women in this period, the author's motivation is to promote moral and
    virtuous behavior in the target audience. In the opening pages, Wingrove
    credits Prudentia Homespun, the pen name of Jane Iliffe West (1758-1852), as
    her inspiration for the current tale.<br><br>"Being a great admirer of the
    writings of my sister authoress, Prudentia Homespun, I have adopted her
    title, and though my tale may be inferior to that lady's yet I think we are
    actuated by the same animating principle; for if we can persuade one reader
    to avoid or quit the paths of vice, or confirm another in the practice of
    virtue, we have not been useless members of society."<br><br>West published
    several similar works during the same period, including Letters to a Young
    Lady, a conservative response to Wollstonecraft, and A Gossip's Story, Jane
    Austen's source text for Sense and Sensibility.

    refutes the widely held assumption that women are inferior writers, or

    social circumstances. Women have been barred from attending school and
    university, for instance, or excluded by law for inheritance, or expected to
    marry during which their time is spent housekeeping and childrearing. Woolf
    imagines what kind of life ‘Judith Shakespeare’ – a brilliant, talented
    sister of Shakespeare – might have lived, concluding that she, ‘would have
    been so thwarted and hindered by other people, so tortured and pulled
    asunder by her own contrary instincts, that she must have lost her health
