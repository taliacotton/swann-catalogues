Untitled.

Screenprint on Strathmore paper, 1951 (printed 1964). 580x395 mm; 23x15 inches, full margins. Numbered 43/50 in pencil, lower right. Published by Lee Krasner Pollock, Estate of Jackson Pollock, with the Pollock Estate blind stamp, lower left. A superb impression of this very scarce print.Betty Parsons (1900-1982), whose gallery on East 57th Street in New York exhibited many of Pollock's (1912-1956) works, organized his fifth solo show in 1951, Black Paintings. To coincide with the exhibit Pollock made screenprints of 6 of the paintings.This series of screenprints, following an intended edition of 25 signed and numbered by Pollock (the edition of 25 was likely never reached), was ultimately printed and published posthumously in an edition of 50 by the artist's estate.

The Imaginary Landscape paintings, represented in this lithograph, are typically horizontally oriented with strong gestural strokes representing rocky landscapes or turbulent seas; the Burst series, vertically oriented, feature an orb shape hovering above a gestural form (see lot 2        and lot 3     ).

According to Hollander, ""It was not until [de Kooning] returned from his trip to Japan that he responded to do a body of lithographs. Perhaps the seeing and feeling of calligraphy, sumi brush painting and Zen inspired him sufficiently to do prints. Whatever, the results were beautiful . . .

Oil on board, 1952. 302x227 mm; 11x9 inches. Signed and dated in oil and crayon, verso.Ex-collection private collection, New York.Smith (1933-1981), a native to Boston, studied at the Art Students League in New York and became part of the circle of second generation Abstract Expressionists, counting as close friends fellow artists Joan Mitchell (1925-1992, see lot 51) and Helen Frankenthaler (1928-2011, see lots 54-57, lot 199 and lot 200). Smith’s style resembles Frankenthaler’s color field paintings and relies on floating, simple forms and color theory. His abstractions were described as “lyrical,” often giving a sense of tranquility.Smith’s first exhibition was alongside Joan Mitchell at the New Gallery in New York and he continued to exhibit in the U.S. through the 1950s before moving to Paris following his wife’s correspondent assignment with Life magazine. Paris’ ex-patriate community of artists, including Sam Francis (1923-1994, see lots 66-70) welcomed Smith and he exhibited widely through Europe. The Smiths returned to New York in 1966, where the artist started to experiment with new media, including spray paint. Smith’s work has received renewed interest in recent years and his works are represented in permanent collections at institutions internationally.",,,772948

He became close friends with Willem de Kooning (see lots 5-10); the two completed a mural project for the 1939 New York World’s Fair. During this time Loew also began to experiment with abstract elements, influenced by Arshile Gorky (1904-1948) and Fernand Léger (1881-1955).Loew also worked as a stained glass apprentice while attending night classes at the Art Students League in New York following his graduation from high school. Among his Art Students League colleagues were David Smith and Jackson Pollock (see lot 1). He studied for several years in Paris and returned to New York at the height of the Great Depression, where he became roommates with Lee Krasner (seelots 58-59) in the East Village. He worked as a restorer and redecorator of churches before his employment by the Treasury Department and later, the Works Progress Association (W.P.A.). After enlisting in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Loew studied with Hans Hofmann (1880-1966) and became interested in Cubism and Neo-Plasticism. His first solo exhibition was with the Artists Gallery in New York in 1949. He continued to travel, teach and exhibit in the United States and Paris through the 1980s.",,,775521

She was among the first American artists to produce non-objective relief sculptures in the early 1930s and continued her focus on abstraction in paintings and drawings of the 1940s and 1950s. Greene was a founding member of the American Abstract Artists group, in 1936, and had her first solo exhibition at Grace Borgenicht Gallery, New York, in 1951, followed by another at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery, New York, in 1955.

Signed in pencil, lower right, and inscribed ""XVI"" and dated in pencil, verso. Printed and published by Tyler Graphics, Ltd., Mount Kisco, with the blind stamp, lower left.Frankenthaler (1928-2011, see lots 54-57, lot 199 and lot 200) was part of the second generation of Abstract Expressionists in New York and pioneered the Color Field Painting style. Though she was frequently lauded for her experimentation in painting, her work as a printmaker has also been noted for her ground-breaking innovations. The New York School had not practiced printmaking extensively until Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE) was founded in 1957 in West Islip. Frankenthaler did not enthusiastically come into printmaking at first, but as she became more versatile with various printmaking techniques and their sometimes labor-intensive process, she became a devotee and would frequently return to print workshops throughout her career. Frankenthaler first used monotype, which can incorporate different materials as print matrixes to create unique impressions, in 1964. The monotype medium allowed Frankenthaler the freedom to work directly on the printing plate or other flat matrix.Over the course of her career, she experimented with printing monotypes from woodcuts (then considered an outdated medium), torn rubber and intaglio. To push the boundaries of the woodcut, Frankenthaler collaborated with the master printer Kenneth Tyler in the 1970s. She put together matrixes of thin plywood which were separately inked with colors in order to achieve her signature stained and washed style. She also used lithographic presses and different papers in experimenting with her woodcuts. In her partnership with Tyler, Frankenthaler pushed the boundaries of the medium to parallel painterly abstraction.",,,776492

Signed, dated, inscribed ""AP"" and numbered 8/12 in pencil, lower right. Printed by Luis Remba, Mixografía, Los Angeles. Published by Mixografía, Los Angeles. A superb impression of this large print, with strong colors.According to Harrison, ""Frankenthaler began working with Mixografía in Los Angeles in December 1986. For the process of Mixografía, created by Luis Remba, director of the workshop [along with his wife Lea Remba and the Mexican artist Rufino Tamayo in 1973], an artist must first make a maquette, from which a copper plate is then made in the negative. Once the copper plate is inked, moist handmade paper is laid on top and placed in a press with extreme vertical pressure, thus forming a sheet of paper with the ink infused in its surface. The molds or maquettes can be made from a variety of materials . . . Guadalupe (Harrison 164) and Hermes are melted wax images over wax plates, materials that create a smooth ground for the large planes of color to play off.Frankenthaler initially created eight molds, from which she chose five to make the [Mixografía] editions. The other three matrixes were discarded, though there are a few proofs remaining in Frankenthaler's archive. Once the molds were completed, Mixografía sent the artist a number of un-inked white sheets formed from her copper plates. She used these to create nine monoprints by hand, working the surface with paint and pastel (Harrison 155-163). Although unlike any of the final edition [Mixografía] prints, these pieces helped Frankenthaler to adjust to the new medium and to develop her ideas."" Harrison 166.",,,776507

In the early part of his career, he was drawn to Social Realism and Regionalist movements. He turned towards abstraction after World War II (he served in the Navy) and lived in San Francisco for two years, enrolling in the San Francisco School of Fine Arts in 1946. Subsequently, he moved to the East Coast to study with Hans Hofmann (1880-1966), and befriended many artists of the New York Abstract Expressionist movement, including Willem de Kooning (1904-1997, see lots 5-10), Franz Kline (1910-1962) and Mark Rothko (1903-1970). His signature grid-like paintings, like the current work, were developed during this period when he was experimenting with symbolism and action painting.

Lithograph on Serir Whitewove paper, 1942. 215x398 mm; 8½x18 inches, full margins. Signed, titled, dated and numbered 3/30 in pencil, lower margin. Printed by Reinhard Schulmann, Hickory, North Carolina. From Graphic Tectonics. A very good impression of this extremely scarce lithograph.We have not found another impression at auction in the past 30 years.In 1941, Albers (1888-1976) was invited by Walter Gropius (with whom he collaborated previously at the Bauhaus, Weimar; Gropius was the founder of the famed modern art and design school, Albers was first a student then a young instructor during the early 1920s) to teach at Harvard's Graduate School of Design. While at Harvard he started a series of drawings that aimed to challenge the nature and aims of graphic art. Conventional drawing was based on a modulated line to create the illusion of space on a two-dimensional surface; Albers combined a series of unmodulated thick and thin lines in precisely drawn compositions to show that, even with the constraints of the unmodulated line, graphic art could achieve movement and depth on the page.The drawings formed the basis for a series of lithographs the following year. The Graphic Tectonics series marked a shift in Albers' printmaking output. Prior to this, he had been experimenting with drypoint and free-flowing lines. Instead, he turned to using straight-edges to create precise compositions more associated with machine-made than handmade, and the series is a precursor of the work that dominated the remainder of his career, including his iconic exploration of color theory employing squares and other hard-edged geometric forms (see lot 137 and lot 138).

Portfolio with complete text and 9 color screenprints on 150-gram Umbria paper, 1984. 700x497 mm; 27x19½ inches (sheets), full margins, loose as issued.One of 125 numbered copies. Numbered ""17"" in pencil, on the justification page. Each color screenprint signed, dated and numbered 17/125 in pencil, lower margin. Printed by Samuele Villa, Muggiò. Published by Fausta Squatriti, Milan. With the original printed cardboard portfolio folder. Superb, richly-inked impressions of these scarce screenprints.The portfolio is a survey of Albers' (1899-1994) graphic work from 1925 to 1983. According to the introduction by Squatriti, ""Anni Albers has always thought that art is the continuation and the development of the ancient craftmanship on a plane no longer practical but purely intellectual. Her graphic work, therefore, has the value of a profound analysis of the logical structure of perception or, more precisely, of the substantial unity of the sensorial and the psychological moments of vision: in other words, of the active, and not merely receptive, character of vision. This publication of very limited selection of her graphic work is an homage to an authentic artist, who in fifty years of dedicated work has chosen above all to remain faithful to the glorious school in which she was trained and to the aesthetics and ethics of art which she learned. Always modern, she has never sought the new for its own sake. Serenely she has followed the thread of her first research, working with it, making it into context, without ever repeating or boring herself.""",,,776335

She studied arts education at Columbia University, New York, but while there decided to become an artist. She worked for a several years as a teacher then moved to New Mexico in 1947 fully dedicating herself to her artwork.She returned to New York in 1957 on the advice of the gallerist Betty Parson, and became acquainted with Robert Indiana (1928-2018, see lots 220-224 and 272-274), Ellsworth Kelly (1923-2015, see lots 159-162 and lot 207) and Ad Reinhardt (1913-1967). This time period coincided with her shift from focusing on biomorphic shapes towards the geometric grid-like compositions for which she is known. She had her first solo exhibition at the Betty Parson Gallery, New York in 1958 and over the next decade gained acclaim in the New York art world.However, in 1967 she abruptly left New York and ceased creating art for 7 years. She eventually began painting again after settling in near seclusion in New Mexico. She is celebrated for her serene geometric paintings that are rooted in Zen Buddhist and American Transcendentalist ideas, pairing the metaphysical with structure and space. She viewed herself as an Abstract Expressionist, though not in the gestural-forward manner of much of the New York school, and her works were restrained, yet based in emotions, spiritual inspiration and the beauty of nature.",,,774683

Portfolio with complete set of 6 aquatints with folding and embossing on Strathmore paper, 1972. 1012x770 mm; 40x30 inches (sheet, unfolded), full margins, loose and folded as issued. Each signed, titled and numbered 4/42 in pencil, lower margin. Printed by Crown Point Press, San Francisco. Published by Parasol Press, Ltd., Portland. With the original wooden box.We have found only 4 other complete portfolios at auction in the past 30 years.The conception of the Locus series emanates from Rockburne’s (b. 1932) Drawing Which Makes Itself inspired by the everchanging geometry of fresh ski-tracks in the snow. Rockburne’s continued exploration in using paper not only as a static material upon which an artist draws, but as actively changing forms is evident in the Locus series. The current portfolio and the series Drawing Which Makes Itself are still widely celebrated; the latter being exhibited in 2013 at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Born in Montreal, Rockburne was a precocious child, studying at the École des Beaux-Arts de Montréal while still attending elementary school. In 1950, she received a scholarship to attend Black Mountain College, North Carolina, and studied under John Cage (1912-1992, see lot 177), Franz Kline (1910-1962), Merce Cunningham (1919-2009), and Philip Guston (1913-1980, see lot 29), among others. Rockburne’s intellectual curiosity and rebellious streak was nurtured at Black Mountain and her multifaceted education would provide the foundation for her abstract, exploratory art, rooted in mathematics and geometry.She moved to New York in 1955 and became active in the artist community alongside friends Robert Rauschenberg (1925-2008, see lots 186-196), Jasper Johns (b. 1930, see lots 181-185), Brice Marden (b. 1938, see lot 331) and Susan Weil (b. 1930). Though she became dissatisfied with art-making in the early 1960s, Rockburne used other creative outlets, participating in dance, films, and performances, including Claes Oldenburg’s (b. 1929, see lots 261-266) Washes at Al Roon’s Health Club. Rockburne began to produce fine art again in the late 1960s, the restart to a widely influential career.",,,773576

Laminate and acrylic on Celotex in artist's original frame, 2013. 702x738x205 mm; 27½x29x8 inches.Gifted by the artist's widow to Ken Polinskie, the artist's assistant, New York; private collection, New York.Artschwager (1923-2013) was born in Washington, D.C. He studied mathematics and science at Cornell University and worked a variety of jobs, including furniture making, before turning his attention towards art. While of the same generation as Pop, Minimalist and Conceptual artists, his work often skirted these broader movements and had a wholly unique aesthetic that explored the perception of objecthood and material culture. He used everyday materials such as formica and Celotex insulation as the basis of his sculptures, and his works often took the form of utilitarian objects.The image of the Running Man came from a photograph that appeared in the <Boston Globe, which showed a solitary figure darting through the snow in a Brookline, Massachusetts, park in 1989. Artschwager clipped the image, and it became a theme in his work in starting in 1991. It would appear in subsequent series through the remainder of his career. In 2013, he returned to the image in what would be his last artistic series; the figure appears in monochromatic silhouettes in hand-crafted frames. Entitled No More Running Man, the series was exhibited posthumously at Gagosian Gallery, New York in 2014.",,,776323

Color lithograph on Angoumois à la Main paper, 1971-72. 737x1092 mm; 29x43 inches, full margins. Signed, dated and numbered 40/70 in pencil, lower margin. Printed and published by Gemini, G.E.L., Los Angeles, with the blind stamps, lower right. A superb impression of this scarce lithograph.This lithograph is based on the encaustic on canvas with collage Portrait—Viola Farber, 1961-62 by Johns (b. 1930) in the Mrs. William Sisler Collection, New York. Johns' inspiration for the painting and lithograph was the American choreographer and dancer Viola Farber (1931-1998).Farber met Merce Cunningham at Black Mountain College in 1952 and a year later became a founding member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. Through Cunnigham and the company, Farber was connected to the New York art scene of the 1950s-60s, and notably artists Robert Rauschenberg (who in addition to his career as a solo artist, designed sets and costumes for the Cunningham Dance Company), Johns (who privately assisted Rauschenberg during the 1950s in some of his designs for the company) and Cy Twombly (Rauschenberg had romantic relationships with both Johns and Twombly).Farber created many roles in Cunningham's works, such as Crises, Paired Rune and Nocturne. Commenting on Crises which premiered in 1960, around the same time Johns made Portrait--Viola Farber, Cunnigham noted that it was, ""An adventure in togetherness . . . I decided to allow for the dancers contacting each other, not only through holding or being held, but also by outside means. I used elastic bands around a wrist, an arm, a waist or a leg. By one dancer inserting a hand under the band on another they were attached but also at the same instant free."" Cunningham wore a wide elastic band around his waist and a smaller one on his wrist which the other dancers would attach themselves to him at different times during the performance. Johns referenced the elastic band in the lithograph, which holds together the fork and spoon at the right. In 1965, Farber left Cunningham's dance company and in 1968, established her own company.

Color oil stick and gouache on two joined sheets of heavy cream wove paper, 1960. 370x690 mm; 14x27¼ inches. Signed and dated in ball-point pen and ink, lower right recto, and counter signed and dated with a smaller signature in ball-point pen and ink, lower left recto.Acquired directly from the artist by the current owner, private collection, New York.Saul’s (b. 1934) iconoclastic paintings draw references from American culture and cartoons, pre-dating the Pop Art works of Andy Warhol (1928-1987, see lot 210, lots 229-244) and Roy Lichtenstein (1923-1997, see lots 211-219, 245-248, 250 and 251). In his earlier paintings, Saul was influenced by prominent mid-century abstract artists before he began incorporating comic book and cartoon characters around 1960. Juxtaposing widely-recognizable characters and mundane products along with symbols of war and jagged, almost violently-drawn color fields, Saul explored the darkest themes in American culture at the time, including government corruption, civil rights and the Vietnam War.Saul brought uncomfortable, current themes such as violence, racism, greed, corruption, history and criminality to the forefront, made lighter for the viewer to process through his biting sense of humor and bright color palette, which became trademarks of Pop Art. Through his celebrated artistic commentary on contemporary issues, Saul drew stylistic influences from Surrealism and an array of old master artists, notably Francisco José de Goya (1746-1828) and William Hogarth (1697-1764).",,,775605

Pencil on cream wove paper mounted on cardstock, circa 1965. 161x92 mm; 6½x3¾ inches. Signed in pencil, lower right recto.De Kooning (1918-1989) worked on a screenprint with Poleskie at Chiron Press, New York, during 1964-65. Poleskie later recalled, ""At that time we were close friends and she (de Kooning) was one of the first to work with me in my print shop. I recently found some photographs of her in my studio, Chiron Press.  [The photographer] Eddie (Johnson) was also a sculptor and a film maker. We collaborated on a movie called The Bird Film, which was widely shown back then at places like The Bridge Cinema in NYC and the Yale Film Festival . . . Elaine de Kooning was an associate producer, and many of the movie’s scenes were shot on her farm at Livingston Manor in upstate New York. Eddie also took the photographs that appeared in Life magazine when Elaine painted her famous, or infamous, portrait of President John F. Kennedy. Elaine's screenprint, was done from her ""bulls"" series. It was printed in six colors, and Elaine made all the stencils herself, with my help and supervision, using the tusche and glue technique. This process is quite time consuming, and few of the artists I worked with back then were willing to put in the effort required to make a print this way. Elaine and I made a lot of test prints and pulled proofs in many different color combinations. Elaine was a true painter at heart.""Ex-collection Stephen Poleskie, Chiron Press, New York.",,,774645

A very good impression of this important, early Pop Art print, with strong colors. Corlett II.5.Ex-collection Stephen Poleskie, Chiron Press, New York.The deluxe, before letters, edition of an image also used as a poster and a mailer, both reproduced as color offset lithographs from this color screenprint, for Lichtenstein's (1923-1997) November 20-December 16, 1965, exhibition at Leo Castelli Gallery, New York. This was the first exhibition of Lichtenstein's group of 15 iconic Brushstroke paintings. The current screenprint, Lichtenstein's first of many prints on the Brushstroke theme, is based on White Brushstroke I, oil on canvas, 1965 (sold Sotheby's, New York, June 29, 2020, lot 107). According to Waldman, “Lichtenstein focused on brushwork as the signature of a style and used it . . . to address the issue of what characterizes style in art. Is it defined by an artist’s brushstroke? Is it the result of the transmutation of one form into another? Or could it even be determined by an artist’s signature on a common object? Or does it embrace all of these? In White Brushstroke I and other paintings of the period, Lichtenstein implies that painting can be reduced to a sign and that brushstrokes can be the means by which we recognize, not only a style--but content,” (Waldman, Roy Lichtenstein, New York, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1993, pages 156-57.Lichtenstein discussed the brushstroke form as follows: ""The very nature of a brushstroke is anathema to outlining and filling in as used in cartoons. So I developed a form for it which is what I am trying to do in the explosions, airplanes, and people--that is, to get a standardized thing--a stamp or image. The brushstroke was particularly difficult. I got the idea very early because of the Mondrian and Picasso paintings which inevitably led to the idea of a de Kooning,"" (Corlett, The Prints of Roy Lichtenstein, A Catalogue Raisonné 1948-1993, Washington, D.C., 1993, pages 24-25).This is the first screenprint on which Lichtenstein collaborated with Stephen Poleskie at Chiron Press, New York, and several additional printed projects with Poleskie followed in quick succession during the mid-to-late 1960s (see lots 212-219).",,,774651

Signed in pencil, lower right recto.Ex-collection Stephen Poleskie, Chiron Press, New York.Indiana's (1928-2018) drawing for the color screenprint poster produced to announce his 1966 solo exhibition (which the artist referred to as his ""LOVE show"") at Stable Gallery, New York. Indiana developed the first incarnation of LOVE in 1964 as a design for a personal holiday greeting that he sent to his friends, and then refined as a printed Christmas card for The Museum of Modern Art, New York, the following year. In 1966, the artist debuted major paintings of the motif at Stable Gallery, New York, for which he made this drawing as a maquette for the gallery poster.According to Indiana, ""The word LOVE got to be the way it is because I have a kind of a passion about symmetry and the dividing of things into equal parts. The word LOVE is that way because those four letters best fit a square if the square is squared by that particular arrangement. And it was really that sort of a necessity for a very compact form that I came upon that arrangement . . . With the red, blue and green paintings the interaction in the eye is of such a nature that with the slightest change of light the fields automatically interchange, the positive becomes negative and vice versa, with almost a violent effect in the eye.""",,,774632

Maravell, ""The Paris Review commissioned a lot of artists to do posters for them. Actually, they're a terrific bunch of images. All of them were done at Steve Poleskie's. Andy Warhol had been working with photoscreens, and I wanted to fool around with it. So I made a photoscreen from a painting I had, and I just played around with the colors. I used a photographic process--to dots--on only one part of it, actually, and made the rest of the print flat. The arty lettering is in a flat color, I was very pleased with the result. It was an experiment. I had decided early on that I wanted to do something a little different--technically--in every print just to extend the range,"" (Alex Katz, The Complete Prints, New York, 1983, page 11).",,,774638

Stimulated by these friendships, and seeing the early proto-Pop works that Robert Rauschenberg (1925-2008, see lots 186-196, 208 and 209 ) and Jasper Johns (b. 1930, see lots 181-185) were creating in New York at the time, Thiebaud began a series of very small paintings based on images of food displayed in windows, leading him to what has been the signature theme of his work over the past five decades (see lot 302).",,,776679

Color aquatint and etching on Zerkall paper, 2004. 147x195 mm; 5x7 inches, full margins. Edition of 199. Signed and dated in pencil, lower right. Proofed by the artist and Fritze Margull, Port of Spain, Trinidad. Printed by Fritze Margull, Berlin. Published by Griffelkunst, Hamburg. From Black Palms. A superb impression with strong colors.According to the artist, the Black Palms series (see lot 387), ""Came about whilst working with the printer Fritze Margull. He came down to Port of Spain, Trinidad where I have set up house and studio. We built a small make shift studio in the corner of a large warehouse space--we had a small table top press that we used to proof the plates with. The images for the etchings for the most part are relatively new ones for me although I have made some drawings, and water colours using similar imagery. I am in the process of using the images to make larger scale paintings now. I have found that making etchings prior to making paintings is a useful way to familiarize myself with the subject and imagery,"" (Griffelkunst website). Doig notes that the compositions for many of the images were actually derived from a set of old postcards he'd bought in London showing various Indian scenes, which he in turn combined with his Trinidad experiences. In the case of Pelican, ""The figure dragging the dead pelican was dragging a fishing net in the Indian post card--I saw a man killing and dragging a pelican along a beach here [Trinidad]; dinner,"" (Griffelkunst website).",,,776728
