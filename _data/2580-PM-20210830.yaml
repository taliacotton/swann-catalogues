    An extremely detailed letter from the Alaskan wilderness in the year of the

  TYPESET: >-
    Autograph Letter Signed to his father Charles. 12 tightly-written quarto
    pages, 9¾ x 7¾ inches, on 3 folding sheets of Collins Overland Telegraph
    illustrated cartographic letterhead; partial separations and minor wear at
    folds.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The explorer and scientist William Healey Dall (1845-1927) wrote this letter
    as a young man, after serving in the Collins Overland Telegraph Expedition
    from 1865 to 1867. The expedition had attempted to lay a telegraph line from
    California through British Columbia, the interior wilds of Russian-held
    Alaska, across the Bering Strait, and on to Moscow. This was seen as a more
    practical alternative to the failed transatlantic cable projects. However,
    when the first successful cable across the Atlantic was laid in 1867, the
    Western Union expedition folded its operation. <br><br>William's epic letter
    was written in what he still describes as "Russian America," although just
    two months earlier the Seward Purchase had been completed and the flag of
    the United States raised. He addressed it to his father, the Unitarian
    missionary to India, Charles Henry Appleton Dall (1816-1886, see also lot
    164). William had remained behind in Alaska after the Americans ended the
    expedition, wintering over in a small trading post with Russians and "a
    little halfbreed boy who Ketchum brought down as an interpreter from Fort
    Yukon, and whom I volunteered to take care of, feed, clothe, & get home
    again in the spring," as well as two Inuit: "my faithful Rurill, the other
    Peetka, whose hand I saved last year after he had blown it pretty well to
    pieces by careless use of his gun." He describes the Russian inhabitants as
    "most of them felons, sent here from Siberia . . . For lying, stealing, and
    all petty meannesses and gross vices, taken as a whole they would be hard to
    match." He goes on to describe his entire past year's adventures: paddling
    down the coast of the Bering Sea by night in a small walrus-skin craft,
    searching for a harbor by the Northern Lights; climbing a 70-foot cliff by
    himself to collect a cache of fossils, "dropping from ledge to ledge by the
    light birch which grew in the clefts of the rock." William held onto the
    letter all winter without any opportunity for sending it, and then resumed
    on 23 April, still in Nulato. Here he describes (and draws) the style of
    fish trap used on this coast. He also describes the frenzied reaction of the
    Russians who had been told to liquidate the Fur Company, "pack up all the
    company's property and put it on a raft, abandon the fort to the elements &
    the Indians, and float down to the mouth of the Youkon." Months later, he
    still had found no means of sending the letter, so added three more pages on
    26 September 1868: "I shall give you an account of my trip down the Youkon &
    narrow escape from being shot by an Indian on the way, when I get home."
    <br><br>WITH--a much shorter second letter from Dall to his mother, San
    Francisco, 4 October 1868, while headed home: "You must expect to see a
    rough sunburnt individual whose nose has been reddened by frequent freezing;
    and whose complexion has not been improved by the Arctic sun & wind, or a
    diet of fish and sealmeat; and whose temper has suffered from driving dogs."
    <br><br>AND--an undated, untitled, unsigned speech on the growth of the
    Episcopal Church in Alaska, 17 pages on loose sheets, 9½ x 5¾ inches. It was
    apparently written for an audience of Episcopalians (see page 9). The events
    of 1886 are described as "less than 20 years ago," and the term of Bishop
    Peter Rowe is described as extending "for ten years" (page 15), suggesting a
    date of 1905.

    The first engraving of a much-beloved 1784 painting, usually known by the
    simpler title "Indian Widow," which is now in the Derby Museum in England.
    It was likely inspired by a passage on Muscogee and Chickasaw funerary rites
    in James Adair's 1775 "History of the American Indians," page 187: "If he
    was a war-leader, she is obliged for the first moon, to sit in the day-time
    under his mourning war-pole, which is decked with all his martial trophies,
    and must be heard to cry with bewailing notes. . . . They are allowed no
    shade, or shelter." A stormy coastline and raging volcano can be seen in the
    background. Perhaps the painting could also be read as an allegory for Great
    Britain's recent loss of its American colonies.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Samuel George Morton (1799-1851) was a Philadelphia medical school professor
    and well-respected scientist in his time. He collected skulls and other
    remains from across North and South America, comparing cranial sizes and
    determining that Caucasians had superior brain capacity. His work was
    influential in the early years of what is now termed scientific racism, and
    was used to justify slavery. His collection of skulls made their way to the
    University of Pennsylvania. A recent report by Paul Wolff Mitchell, "Black
    Philadelphians in the Samuel George Morton Cranial Collection," pointed out
    the disturbing nature of the collection, and just this past April, the
    university museum pledged to repatriate some of these human remains.
    <br><br>The plates are mostly by lithographers John Collins and Thomas
    Sinclair; Collins was known for producing views of Philadelphia and Newport,
    RI. Bound in after the final plate is a circular signed in type by Collins
    dated Philadelphia, 1 November 1839, 10 x 7¼ inches, explaining that he had
    been "almost exclusively engaged for two years past" on Crania Americana and
    was now eager to tackle on new projects, particularly lithography for other
    anatomical works.<br><br>An enthusiastic quote by an 1873 bibliographer
    shows the seriousness with which Morton's work was treated at the time:
    "Both in this country and in Europe, wherever learning and science are
    reverenced, Mr. Morton’s work has been recognized, as one of the best
    contributions to exact knowledge of the history of man, ever offered as the
    work of one individual"--Field 1100. Sabin 51022.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    William Addison Phillips (1824-1893) was born in Scotland and had been an
    anti-slavery journalist in Kansas, served as colonel of the Union Army's
    Cherokee regiment during the Civil War, and then worked as an attorney for
    the Cherokee Nation. He later served six years in Congress. In this circular
    letter addressed "To the Honorable, the Senate of the United States," he
    argues that the Cherokee held their land by patent rather than treaty:
    "Their title is as perfect as that to any property in this country. If it is
    to be called into question, there is an end of all security." The Cherokee
    sought to sell these excess lands to help support "nearly 800 orphans of war
    for the Union alone" and fund thirty English-language schools. The Senate
    sought to block the sale in favor of other investors including a railroad
    line. OCLC lists one copy of this letter, at Yale.

    The important Cherokee leader John Ross (1790-1866) delivers a state of the
    nation address, lauding the Cherokee progress in Indian Territory: "Peace
    and prosperity prevail within our limits. . . . The cause of civilization
    among us progresses, if not rapidly, at a steady and manifest pace. . . .
    Religion and education have received marked attention." He acknowledges
    complaints that missionaries had been fomenting trouble among the
    territory's enslaved people: "Slavery being recognized by the laws of the
    nation, is entitled to protection from agitation and disturbance. . . . The
    existence of slavery among us is sanctioned by our own laws and by the
    intercourse of the government of the United States. . . . The disturbed
    condition of affairs in Kansas in which we have lands . . . attracts
    attention here as well as elsewhere. . . . Our true policy is to mind our
    own business, and not travel beyond our own limits to seek difficulties."
    Ross also denounces "the nefarious traffic in stolen horses carried on by
    thieves from the Indian country with citizens of the neighboring
    states."<br><br>While other similar messages of the principal chief are
    traced in OCLC for 1859 and other dates, we find no record of this message

  TYPESET: >-
    230 items (0.3 linear feet) in one box: 176 letters, almost all addressed to
    Joshua Ross, many with original envelopes, plus receipts, genealogical

    worn.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This archive covers a critical period in Cherokee history, from 1898 to
    1906, when the federal government aggressively dismantled the Cherokee
    Nation's independent government and transformed the Indian Territory into
    the new state of Oklahoma. <br><br>Joshua Ross (1833-1924) of Muscogee,
    Indian Territory was a nephew of longtime Cherokee principal chief John Ross
    (1790-1866). He was an 1860 graduate of Emory and Henry College in Virginia.
    His wife was Muskogee Yargee Ross (circa 1840s-1913), from a similarly
    prominent Creek family and also influential in the community. They resided
    in Muskogee in the Creek Nation, where Joshua became a prominent leader and
    shopkeeper. <br><br>The earliest item in the collection is an 1848 letter
    from cousin Minerva Murrell to Ross while he was attending boarding school
    in Fayetteville, AR, exhorting him to be pious and modest: "Show your
    teacher how well a Cherokee boy can behave himself." The bulk of the
    collection begins in 1872. Cherokee politics (particularly the race for
    Principal Chief which often included a Ross family candidate) and tribal
    membership claims are frequent topics of conversation from the beginning.
    H.C. Hedrick of Sherman TX writes in 1878 regarding a friend who wants to
    settle in Creek Nation for business: "He fears he cannot get satisfactory
    evidence that he is of Indian blood . . . look him up a good looking smart
    young Creek squaw and he will obtain rights in the nation after the old
    plan. But, joking aside, he is willing to go to the nation and operate with
    you." Joshua's cousin William Potter Ross (1820-1891), the former and future
    Principal Chief of the Cherokees, wrote from Washington on 4 January 1872:
    "Our people--the Indian people--should not shut their eyes to the fact that
    sooner of later their political relations must undergo a change. It is no
    want of patriotism to say so much as that. . . . Called with the unvarnished
    multitude to pay New Year's compliments to the President [Grant]. . . .
    Major Boudinot, Dr. Long, Col. Pitchlynn, Judge Fields & Genl. Cooper are
    also in the city." Two letters from Indian agents dated March and April 1873
    negotiate the prices to be paid for cattle killed by railroads in Creek
    Territory. <br><br>Ross was a leader of the Indian International Fair from
    its 1874 inception. The fair brought together representatives from nations
    across the Indian Territory and beyond. 13 letters relate to the fair,
    including communications from several other nations. An 1882 letter promises
    "If you could get Col. Tunstall a full Indian costam I will pay the money
    for the buck skin suit for him and I will bring him . . . to the Indian
    Internation Fair." Also included are a manuscript list of premiums awarded
    at the inaugural 1874 fair; an undated manuscript list of submitted items
    arranged by nation, and a printed handbill program for the 6th fair in 1879
    which gives the four-day schedule and the rules. OCLC lists only one copy.
    Finally, an 1891 letter complains: "Our people seem to have lost interest in
    our fair and the 2 or 3 of us who have kept it up for the last 4 years have
    got tired of doing all the work, and myself footing all the bills. We have
    concluded to let it rest for a while." <br><br>The letters get more intense
    in the late 1890s as the Curtis Act of 1898 started to threaten the Cherokee
    Nation. H.C. Ross wrote on 13 March 1899: "Things are so complicated. I mean
    our public affairs. What will become of us? Nobody can tell. As all the
    government officials are in your town, you may know what they are going to
    do about the Curtis law, whether it will be enforced in full." Ross's sister
    Jennie Murrell wrote frequently from Bayou Goula, LA during this period. On
    8 January 1898 she wrote: "I am astonished at the Cherokee lawyers trying to
    deny our Cherokee blood. I am willing to leave it to any Cherokee & I dare
    say ours is purer & better Cherokee blood than those who testify to a lie. I
    don't want to be left out, so do all you can." Similarly cousin George
    Murrell wrote on 29 October 1896: "I regret that you failed to get our names
    on the census rolls. . . . I dislike to think I am disowned & have no claim
    in the country my grandfather & father lived in for so long, and loved so
    well." Brother J.M. Ross tried to untangle the history of a family enslaved
    by the Rosses in a 20 April 1896 letter: "Calvin Ross was a son of Chaney
    daughter of Sam & Betsey Ross, slaves of mother. His father was Andy Fields,
    slave of Mrs. Sallie Fields, and after her death was bought by her son Rider
    Fields, who lived in the Creek Nation. Calvin had a half brother named Buck
    that lived with bro. Dick Ross." Ross wrote to a contact in Washington,
    Simon Walkingstick, on 28 June 1898: "Please send true copy of the Curtiss
    Bill . . . The Dawes Commission are sending out their wagons . . . to
    Seminole Nation to take census and about the middle of July or summer will
    come to the Creeks for the same purpose." Cherokee leader Jesse Cochran
    wrote from Washington on 9 March 1908(?): "I have little to write
    encouraging a hope that the Cherokees will be fairly treated by the
    Government. Our fate is sealed and we can only take such settlement as they
    are willing to give us out of our own property. The old treaties have been
    thrown to the winds. . . . We have no sympathizers here as of old. The
    Indian Territory is an open door to the people of the U.S., and they propose
    to go in and help themselves." <br><br>More detailed notes on this important

    and taking Jimmy captive. The father John McKinn pursued the Apaches but was
    told the boy had been killed. During his six months in captivity, Santiago
    became fluent in the Apache language, and resisted returning to his birth
    family. He was placed aboard a train with other Apache prisoners bound for
    Florida, but his parents were allowed to collect him when the train stopped
    in Deming, NM. He went on to raise a family in New Mexico, spending his
    final years in Phoenix, AZ.

    White Mountain was also known as "Shot in the Eye" because of a wound he
    suffered at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. In 1901, he went east to
    participate in the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, NY, where he gave a
    remarkable interview to the Buffalo Courier (10 May 1901). In his long
    account of Little Bighorn, he asserted that Custer was not killed in
    battle--he committed suicide rather than face capture and torture. This
    account has not been corroborated by other sources. <br><br>This photograph
    was taken a few years later in September 1907 by De Lancey W. Gill, who was
    an illustrator and staff photographer for the Smithsonian’s Bureau of
    American Ethnology. One of his responsibilities was photographing American
    Indian leaders as they came through Washington on official business. White

    loose and possibly a small number absent, moderate edge wear with minimal

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Garret Abeel (1734-1799) and his brother-in-law Evart Byvanck (1744-1805)
    began a successful partnership as Manhattan iron merchants in 1765. This
    letterbook contains retained drafts for much of their correspondence through
    1771, reflecting a tumultuous period which led to the American Revolution.
    Most of the letters are to the firm's British suppliers of finished metal
    goods, and many discuss the dominant issue of the day: organized American
    resistance to British taxation. Abeel and Byvanck often made their orders
    contingent upon repeal of the Stamp Act or some other Parliamentary action,
    and pressured their wealthy suppliers to use their clout to restore trade.
    They often cited the joint resolutions of American merchants, including a
    flurry of letters written in the week after the Non-Importation Act of 1765.
    <br><br>The letterbook begins with a letter of introduction to the British
    firm of Devonshire & Reeve, followed by a 3-page itemized list of iron goods
    the young Americans ordered from them on 6 February 1765, as well as a
    similarly large follow-up order placed in August. Abeel & Byvanck was off to
    a grand start with a major British supplier; imagine their consternation
    with the imposition of the Stamp Act and the resulting Non-Importation
    Agreement entered by the leading New York merchants on 31 October 1765. That
    same day they sent a letter to British merchants Neate, Pigou & Booth: "If
    it had not been for the late acts of Parliament such as the Sugar and Stamp
    Acts, should have wanted several large articles sent us by your house, but
    while they are in being, dare not order a single article in the way of
    trade, nor do we believe anyone else from this place will order goods till
    those acts are repealed." Abeel & Byvanck drafted a stern letter to their
    main supplier Devonshire & Reeve on 2 November 1765, asking to send their
    last order "only in case the Stamp Act is repealed . . . for should not the
    late strictures laid upon our trade by the Parliament be taken off, America
    must in a short time be the habitation of bankrupts, beggars & slaves. . . .
    In money we are sure they cannot be paid long. That, like a bird of passage,
    flies or has already fled from our inhospitable land." The young merchants
    took four days to calm down, crossed out this version of the letter, and
    drafted another less confrontational version which summarized the
    Non-Importation Agreement: "Altho we are but young beginners, and our
    success in business has exceeded our most sanguine expectations, yet willing
    to sacrifice the prospect of private advantage to the good of our country we
    have joined our fellow citizens in the following resolutions: First, that in
    all orders they send out to Great Britain for goods or merchandise . . .
    they will direct their correspondents not to ship them, unless the Stamp Act
    is repealed. . . . We shall not offer anything against the late impositions
    put upon us by the British Parliament, making no doubt but abler pens than
    ours have communicated to you what may be said on so disagreeable a
    subject." <br><br>On 27 August 1766, the firm wrote again to Devonshire &
    Reeve to discuss the recent repeal: "Upon the receipt of the account of the
    repeal of the Stamp Act, the Americans were softned down more speedy that
    could be imagined. The words tyranny, oppression & rebellion were no more
    heard. Evryone strove how he should most express his loyalty to the best of
    Kings and gratitude to the patriotick ministry." However, "the life of trade
    is still wanting, circulating mediam is nearly sunk, and we are debard the
    liberty of making any more paper money." <br><br>The 24 September 1766
    letter to Devonshire & Reeve reflects a return to normal trade across the
    Atlantic, but with a new wrinkle: "As there is some likelihood of a war
    between England and France. If such a thing should happen . . . send us by
    first opportunity two tons of best FF powder over and above what we have
    already ordered as also two tons shot sorted, two cask bar lead, & one doz
    four foot gun barrels. Please to let the powder be unglazed." On 16 January
    1767 they wrote to Reeve, thanking "those who were our friends at home in
    obtaining the repeal of the Stamp Act" who "certainly deserve a greatfull
    return for their services." Apparently Abeel & Byvanck and other patriotic
    American merchants were trying to support these allies in trade, but certain
    shady British merchants were attempting to break into the trade with
    unrealistic bargains on shoddy goods. A 7 April 1767 letter makes passing
    reference to the British commander in North America Thomas Gage, who
    apparently helped settle the firm's debts in New York. On 24 August 1767
    they assured Reeve that "N. Yorkers are far from being separated from the
    mother country, altho it may be the opinion of many in your part of the
    world that they are ripe for a rebellion. . . . It's true the rigorous
    proceedings of the H of C makes many people think hard of it, but what can
    we do but grin & bear it?" <br><br>The firm's 19 November 1768 letter to
    British supplier Henry Cruger finds them again pressuring their British
    friends to pressure Parliament, offering to place a large order only "if the
    acts of Parliament imposing duties on paper, paint & glass are repealed,
    which I hope & flatter ourselves will be done through the influence of our
    good friends in London, Bristol &c." They wrote similarly to Cruger on 30
    September 1769: "We flatter ourselves that through the struggles of our
    friends in Europe & the methods pursued by us, we shall get relieved from
    the oppressive acts at the next meeting of Parliament." A remarkable long
    letter dated 12 October 1769 sets forth the many ways which British tax
    policy has brought the colonies together: "They have been the means of
    uniting the colonies in a bond of friendship &c which we hope will last
    forever. They have made the Americans more frugal & industrious by . . .
    forcing them to enter upon the manufactory of a great many articles which
    they before imported from Great Britain." <br><br>The American merchants
    remained firm. Abeel & Byvanck wrote a British merchant on 10 July 1770: "An
    express being sent by the committee of merchants in this place to acquaint
    the people of your place that by taking the sense of the inhabitants of this
    city, a majority was found for importing all articles from Great Britain
    except those which are dutable." <br><br>Evert Byvanck went to London in
    1770, and his partner Abeel wrote him a long letter from New York on 16
    January 1771: "The uncertainty of war or peace you know gave us uneasyness
    when you went away. . . . Must again request you not to send too many goods,
    knowing the critical situation of affairs as to peace or war." Although the
    letterbook ends in April 1771, Abeel remained an avid patriot, and served as
    a major in the revolution which soon followed. <br><br>The mercantile
    history, to some readers, will be of even greater interest than the
    machinations over the Stamp Act. The letter book includes several very long
    and detailed order lists for the finished metalware being imported from
    England for retail sale in New York. Tools such as hammers and anvils appear
    frequently, but also great quantities of furniture hardware: cupboard locks,
    hinges, Chinese handles and much more. The likely market for these goods
    would be the cabinetmakers of New York, finishing their masterpieces with
    the latest ornamental hardware from England. Other unusual goods include
    fish hooks, jew's harps, mouse traps, pewter candle molds, and razors.
    <br><br>WITH--a small archive of business records of the firm after it was
    passed on to Garret Abeel's son Garret Byvanck Abeel (1768-1829). The firm
    remained active in Abeel family hands under various partnerships through at
    least the 4th generation by 1915. These later records include:
    <br><br>Expense ledger for mercantile ships. 18 pages, stitched; defective
    with perhaps 10% of the text area torn away on each page. Each page is
    related to a separate ship's voyage, with payments to chandlers,
    blacksmiths, sailmakers, grocers, advances to crew, and other expenses
    preparatory to departure. On 20 May 1795, the account lists £16 paid to "the
    two Negroes who worked their passages" aboard the Brig Diana. July 1794 to
    January 1796. <br><br>Partial daybook of general store sales, [15] pages,
    stitched. 7 August to 9 October 1806.<br><br>A file of 72 receipts,
    invoices, shipping documents, and promissory notes, 1795-1829. <br><br>A
    file of 38 letters addressed to the firm, 1810-1827. Many of these letters
    are orders which go into great specificity about the "old sable Russia iron"
    traded by the Abeels to merchants in the United States and England; others
    discuss the trade more broadly. <D>

    This print depicts an incident on 25 January 1774 in Boston, just a month
    after the Boston Tea Party. Loyalist customs official John Malcolm
    threatened to beat a small boy with a cane. When local patriot George Hewes
    protested, Malcolm caned him in the forehead and knocked him unconscious.
    That night a mob dragged Malcolm from his home, stripped him to the waist,
    tarred and feathered him, threatened to hang him, and forced him to drink
    repeated toasts of tea to the King and Queen. This print shows a noose
    hanging from a "Liberty Tree" with the Stamp Act posted upside down. In the
    background, boxes of tea are being dumped from a ship in the
    background--believed to be the earliest image of the Boston Tea Party.
    <br><br>The artist Philip Dawe was a student of the great British satirist
    William Hogarth. This was first in a series of 5 prints he created on the
    Malcolm incident. In 1904, an entire monograph was devoted to this series of
    Dawe prints: R.T.H. Halsey's "The Boston Port Bill as Pictured by a
    Contemporary London Cartoonist," where "The Bostonians" is illustrated
    facing page 85, and described from pages 82 to 87. Cresswell 670; Reese,

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    These remarkable watercolors were created early in the Revolution by St.
    John Honeywood (1763-1798), then a boy of about 14 years old, who had twin
    obsessions with art and the patriot cause. He was raised in Leicester, MA,
    about 32 miles west of Concord. His father was a physician who had died at
    Ticonderoga in 1776, leaving him an orphan to be raised by his aunt in
    Leicester. He was soon sent off to study at Yale College in New Haven, CT,
    home town of the engraver Amos Doolittle. Honeywood may not have been able
    to readily afford Doolittle's recently published views of the Battles of
    Lexington and Concord, but as an aspiring artist he may have secured access
    to them and made these copies for his own edification. He was known as an
    artist at Yale; his 1779 drawing of classmate George Welles was later
    engraved, and his 1780 pencil sketch was later used to illustrate the
    collected works of his college president and mentor Ezra Stiles. Honeywood
    graduated from Yale in 1782 and became a successful lawyer and political
    figure in Salem, NY. A volume of his poems, which also alludes to his
    artistic endeavors, was published posthumously in 1801. <br><br>A similar
    set of Honeywood's renditions of these prints, but in poor condition, was
    given to the Bangor Public Library in 1913. He signed one of those as "J.
    Honeywood pinx't. AEtat 14," suggesting that it was drawn in 1777 or 1778.
    They are discussed in Ian Quimby's seminal article, "The Doolittle
    Engravings of the Battle of Lexington and Concord" (Winterthur Portfolio,
    1968:4, page 96). Quimby describes the Bangor set: "Although crude, they
    possess a curious attention to detail and felicity in handling the human
    figure that is lacking in the Doolittle prints." The present set is
    different in many details, but similar in style and artistic quality,
    suggesting that it was done at approximately the same time. Oddly enough,
    the present drawings are each signed "J Honeywood, sculp," suggesting that
    Honeywood was the engraver rather than the artist--quite impossible for a
    group of original drawings. He was apparently imitating Doolittle's "sculp"
    in the source images. <br><br>Plate I, "The Battle of Lexington, April 19,
    1775," follows Doolittle's original composition quite closely, and
    reproduces his title and caption text almost verbatim, although some of the
    patriots in the foreground to the left are here out of scale. This plate is
    the only one from Honeywood's Bangor Library set which is reproduced in the
    Quimby article. In the Bangor example, Honeywood has compressed the
    composition to fit a nearly square sheet, but here he has retained the
    original proportions. <br><br>Plate II, "A View of the Town of Concord," is
    probably where Honeywood took the greatest liberties with his source
    material. His handling of perspective is not on par with Doolittle's--the
    gravestones are shown here facing directly to the viewer in straight lines,
    and the windows in the building at left don't quite line up. He has,
    however, added compelling detail to three of the gravestones, making them
    almost legible--a skull and crossed bones are clearly visible in the central
    stone. Honeywood's handling of the figures in the foreground, Colonel Smith
    and Major Pitcairn, is much more realistic and detailed than Doolittle's
    naive treatment. While it's unlikely that Honeywood had any special
    knowledge of their appearances, he may have worked from models to present
    this pair as fully realized individuals. Quimby notes that in Honeywood's
    depiction, "Colonel Smith is shown as the fat man we know him to have been,
    standing in a pose familiar from the conversation pieces of the day. This is
    in marked contrast with Doolittle's treatment of the same figure, which is a
    mere caricature of a man." Major Pitcairn's spyglass is here marked
    "London." <br><br>In Plate III, "The Engagement at the North Bridge in
    Concord," Honeywood makes no effort to replicate Doolittle's treatment of
    the sky, and has reconfigured the farm field in the foreground. The
    essential details of the battle scene remain the same, though, with a row of
    British Regulars at the right of the bridge covering an orderly retreat by
    their comrades as the "Provincials" prepare to cross in pursuit.
    <br><br>Finally, the dramatic Plate IV is "A View of the South Part of
    Lexington," showing houses consumed by flames as the British destroyed
    supplies prior to their retreat. While the mismatched size of the British
    troops in the field cannot be blamed on Doolittle, Honeywood's treatment of
    the patriots firing behind the stone wall in the foreground is probably an
    improvement.<br><br>Provenance: the renowned New York and Vermont Americana

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    As the British prepared for an imminent assault on New York in August 1776,
    an intense and dramatic storm hit Manhattan. For three hours the storm cloud
    sat immobile above the city, with the thunder more of a continuous rumble
    than a series of crashes. Lighting strikes killed more than a dozen
    soldiers, as vividly described in David McCullough's best-seller "1776"
    (pages 155-6). The next morning, the British landed in Brooklyn, and five
    days later came the Battle of Long Island which gave the British control
    over Manhattan. Offered here is a letter written in the midst of this drama.
    <br><br>The letter was written by Abraham William de Peyster (1742-1799) to
    his brother. He starts by announcing the death of their mother Margretje
    Janse Roosevelt de Peyster (1709-1776), and explaining the difficulty of
    moving her body for burial in New York, "whenever the times will admitt of
    it, which at present are truly woefull and calamitous round that distressed
    and devoted city." <br><br>Yet more startling was the sudden death on 21
    August of their nephew William de Peyster, the son of their brother William.
    Young William, an ensign in the 1st New York Regiment, had been out when the
    storm hit, and taken shelter in a tent full of fellow soldiers: "Sitting on
    Wednesday evening just after dark in Capt. Abr. Van Wyck's tent in their
    encampment on the south side of James Delancey's house in the Bowery Lane in
    company with the Capt. and Mr. Peter Vergerou, a leutenant in the same
    rigement, to which place they all three had but just before fled to avoid
    the most awfull storm of rain, thunder and lightning within the memory of
    man. While sitting together, Heaven was pleased to visit them with a flash
    of lightning which killed them all on the spot and almost instantaneously."
    Another officer found young William clinging to life and "had him bled as
    soon as a surgeon could be procured, but all was vain." Uncle Abraham had
    viewed the body and reported that "the lightning had struck him at first on
    the right side of his head, about an inch above the tempel, and had left its
    effects all along that side of his face & neck. His left leg and thigh was
    much brused, and the right side of his breast." The funeral "was by the
    general ordered to be on the evening before on account of the enemy having
    landed and a battle expected in Kings County." <br><br>De Peyster adds in a
    postscript that "5000 Hessians have penetrated almost to Flatbush and a
    battle hourly expected." That battle came quickly, just three days after
    this letter was written, in which the British gained control of Manhattan
    for the duration of the war.

    on outer wrapper.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Substantial diaries by soldiers in the American Revolution are rarely seen
    on the market. We know of no other diaries at auction which were kept in the
    hellish British prisons in New York. This one was written on the rear pages
    of a slim memorandum book which the officer had with him upon his capture.
    Worn and stained but almost entirely legible, it bears testament to harsh
    conditions. It has been published, but apparently only in two obscure
    genealogical publications circa 1985. The memoranda in the front of the
    volume also provide powerful testimony: recruitment records of a militia
    company raised on the eve of the Declaration of Independence, which went on
    to hard duty in the New York campaign. <br><br>Jeremiah Beard Eells
    (1732-1815) of New Canaan, CT was a shoemaker and local official. At the
    start of the war, he was married and had fathered 11 children; two more
    followed in late 1775 and in 1780. He volunteered as an ensign, first in
    June 1776 with the 5th Connecticut State Regiment under Colonel Philip Burr
    Bradley, serving in the Continental Army's fall New York campaign; and then
    in 1777 with the 9th Regiment of Connecticut Militia. <br><br>This diary
    begins with the capture of Eells and 13 companions on 14 March 1777,
    apparently in a small British raid on Norwalk, CT. By this point, thousands
    of American soldiers had already either died in prison or been released in a
    skeletal near-death condition, so Eells was likely nervous about what was to
    follow. The prisoners were "carried on bord the Speadwell & put in the
    hole," shipped across the Long Island Sound to Huntington, NY, and arrived
    in British-held Flushing on the 17th. At that point imprisonment did not
    seem a dire fate: "Went to Governors Brown where we rec’d wine and vittuals
    & was well treated & then had a house provided & two beds for 5 of us & on
    the 18 day Gov. Brown sent us a flask of rum & a ham of veal & we was well
    used." <br><br>Three days later they arrived in Manhattan, where they were
    locked up in one of the three infamous sugar warehouses the British were
    using as prisons: "Sent to the sugerhouse under guard & a very stincking
    place & there was 91 prisnoers before we got their." The sugar houses
    sometimes saw as many as 15 deaths in a day due to malnutrition and disease;
    Ensign Eells mainly noted the cold. On the 24th he wrote "we had no blankit
    & a cold night." The treat of some smuggled tobacco and rumors of prisoner
    exchanges are recorded. On 14 April he wrote “We had a number of prisoners
    brought in, taken at Bound Brook in the parleys.” The patriot defeat at the
    Battle of Bound Brook in New Jersey had taken place the day before.
    <br><br>After 24 days in the sugar house, Eells and some of his fellow
    officers were transitioned into parole arrangements, living in the
    community, and even receiving payment for their labor. Eells's experience as
    a shoemaker proved handy. On 15 April, he wrote "Taken out by David Tomson
    to work at my trade . . . & got me a shirt & Tomson let us have 45 in
    money.” On 26 April he found lodging at the home of noted patriot Hendrick
    Wyckoff in New Lots (now East New York, Brooklyn). On 30 April he learned
    that the British had burned a town in his native Connecticut: "Got nues that
    the regolers had ben to Danbury.” Smallpox broke out where Eells was
    quartered on 1 May, and he was promptly inoculated by Dr. Daniel Menema, a
    local patriot. He nonetheless contracted the disease, but recovered within a
    month. Twice he received small sums of money via the Continental Army's
    prisoner agent Lewis Pintard. The diary ends on 24 November. <br><br>The
    diary occupies the last several leaves of a memorandum book kept by Eells;
    the earlier pages are interesting in their own right. Several of the entries
    relate to the first months of his Connecticut militia company in 1776 and
    early 1777, when they went on active duty in the New York campaign. One page
    lists the payments he received from 25 June to 5 July 1776 "rec'd of Capt.
    Sam'l Keeler for the purpose of enlisting soldiers," followed by sums paid
    out "for the premium of equipage of soldiers." £4 is paid out to one Sarah
    Comstock, presumably for supplying blankets or uniforms; 8 recruits are paid
    extra for having to find their own blankets, while one sum was "paid to
    Ebenezer Hickson for the premium of a blankit that Henry Wiat caried in
    servis." On another page is a list of soldiers in Eells's company and date
    of enlistment, from June through September 1776. Spanning 3 pages are the
    signatures of the company's troops in June and July 1776 "in full of our
    bounty and first month wages for the ensuing campaign." 38 men are named.
    One page shows Eells charging 6 of his soldiers for shoes or shoe repair,
    which he was apparently doing in his free time; one soldier covered the cost
    of his new soles when he "paid for rum that we drank at Harvey's in York."
    Two other payments were made on this page in Bucks County, PA, on 20 and 25
    December 1776, where the Continental Army had recently retreated. A page of
    faded and worn partial accounts on the inside rear wrapper show payments
    made at encampments such as Morristown, Phillipsburg, and Ramapo.
    <br><br>Several memorandum pages date from the period of Eells's
    imprisonment. On the verso of the final diary page is an
    insignificant-looking memorandum dated 15 April 1777, representing Eells's
    first work outside the sugar house: "Rec'd of David Tomson in cash, 0:19:6 .
    . . by 1 lb of bread 0:1:0." After weeks in prison, that bread must have
    been well appreciated. A running account with his host Hendrick Wyckoff
    extends over two pages, with Eells making shoes for him, his wife and "Nat"
    and "Phillis" (presumably servants); on the credit side are cider, grog and
    bitters provided to Eells. This account extends through 30 November 1778,
    suggesting his parole in Brooklyn lasted for a full year longer than his
    diary extends. Several similar brief entries for boarding with Jacobus
    Cornell of New Lots in December 1778 also relate to his time in Brooklyn.
    Finally, a handful of entries relate to Eells's personal work as a
    shoemaker, or in serving writs as a justice of the peace, back in New
    Canaan.<br><br>References: Earnest Edward Eells, "Eells Family History in
    America, 1633-1952" (copy included), pages 51-56, including background
    information and a full transcript of the diary; the transcript also appeared
    in an issue of the Eells Family Association Bulletin circa 1985. Also see
    Worthington Ford’s 1893 article “British and American Prisoners of War,
    1778,” which confirms that Eells and his compatriots were captured in
    Norwalk, CT on March 14 1777 and were still in Brooklyn on parole in 1778.

  TYPESET: >-
    Manuscript document signed by a Wallingford official. 2 pages, 13½ x 8
    inches; folds, uncut.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This invoice includes 25 expense lines submitted by the town of Wallingford
    to the State of Connecticut for the support of individual families, each
    with a "stipulated price" and a much higher "price given." Each amount is
    different, suggesting that the support was rendered as needed, rather than
    in a fixed stipend. The docketing reads "Wallingford acct for supplying
    soldiers' families," and the first expense is for "Sundrys bought for the
    family of David Stone as per bill." Some of the names are easily identified
    as having served in the Continental Army. Levi Munson was a lieutenant in
    the 6th Connecticut Regiment, and Ephraim Chamberlain a lieutenant in the

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Rufus Lincoln (1751-1838) of Wareham, MA enlisted as a corporal at the
    Lexington Alarm, and was serving as a lieutenant in the 14th Massachusetts
    Regiment when captured near Schuylkill, NY in December 1777. As this
    collection shows, he was imprisoned in British-held New York, where he was
    paroled in Flatlands, Brooklyn by March 1779. For at least part of this
    time, he lodged at the home of Petrus Ammerman. He was released by 1781,
    when he transferred to the 7th Massachusetts as a captain and served until
    the end of the war. <br><br>Offered here are two commonplace books written
    by Lincoln while on parole in Flatlands. They contain a mix of essays and
    verse which he copied from books and periodicals, perhaps from Ammerman's
    library. Interspersed are a few copies of important documents relating to
    the Revolution, particularly high-level correspondence on the negotiations
    for prisoner exchanges. A few items do not appear to be published elsewhere,
    and may be original compositions by Lincoln or his fellow prisoners.
    <br><br>The smaller of the two volumes contains the war-related material.
    Possibly original patriotic pieces include: <br><br>"Some Birth Day Verses
    Composed by James Moore while Prisoner on Long Island, October 30th." Reads
    in part "My earthy cumforts often snatch't away / And into darkness sunk my
    brightest day / And now I suffer for my country's cause / Because we dare
    oppose a tyrant's laws / But you my friends who suffer equal woo / Can best
    believe the pains I under goo."<br><br>"On Redemption: A Poem Composed by
    James Moore While Prisoner on Long Island, the Substance Taken from a Small
    Peace Said to be Found in the Isle of Patmuss." <br><br>"A New Song to the
    Tune Black Sloven," which begins "Ye brave sons of freedom, assemble to day
    / So honest, so hearty, so happy and gay / Come joyn in the choras and
    chearfully sing / In prais of the land that with freedom doth spring."
    <br><br>A poem which begins "What means the tolling of the Flatland bell /
    Or crouds of prisoners there pray tell," apparently written on 5 April 1780.
    <br><br>Among the important war documents Lincoln has transcribed here, we
    find no other source for one: "A General State of British and American
    Prisoners, December 29 1779." It is a table which counts prisoners on each
    side, broken out by rank. Eight officers are named at the bottom, who are
    not counted in the table for various reasons. Other more widely available
    documents which appear here in transcription include a partial transcript of
    proposals for a prisoner exchange drafted circa early January 1780; a letter
    from General Washington on prisoner exchanges dated 1 February 1780; and
    proposed articles of capitulation at Siege of Charleston, 1780.
    <br><br>Lincoln copied extensive literary material to pass the time. Most
    notably, poems by the trailblazing Black poet Phillis Wheatley appear in
    each volume, as well as the introduction to her 1773 collection of poems. It
    may be interesting to see that Wheatley's book had made the trip from London
    to New York by 1779, and that this young patriot officer found resonance in
    her work, alongside passages from Addison's Spectator, the Dictionary of the
    Holy Bible, Robinson Crusoe, and the Universal Gazetteer. <br><br>These
    papers were the property of Lincoln's descendant James Minor Lincoln
    (1854-1916), who published portions in his 1904 book "The Papers of Captain
    Rufus Lincoln." The larger commonplace book is described briefly in this
    publication as "Diary Number Three" from pages 62 to 64. The smaller
    commonplace book is transcribed in full in the 1904 book as "Diary Number
    Four" from pages 65 to 95 (although the manuscript has lost at least one
    final leaf since it was published). A full summary of the contents of both
    manuscript volumes is available upon request. <br><br>WITH--manuscript
    copies of additional Rufus Lincoln papers on about 40 leaves of linen or
    tracing vellum, apparently done at around the same time as the 1904 book.
    They include copies of important correspondence, and a long and detailed
    "Return of American Officers and Other Prisoners on Long Island, August 15th
    1778." While these documents were published in the 1904 book, the book does
    not include images, and the present location of the original manuscripts is
    unknown.

    generals named in the monument all died from 1775 to 1777. The message of
    this engraving was perhaps even more timely when this engraving was

    This letter was written just eight days after the surrender by Cornwallis at
    Yorktown: "I started from my father’s just time enough to reach Baltimore at
    a reasonable hour, & on arriving in its vicinity, had I not been previously
    informed of the capture of Cornwallis & his band, I should not have known my
    what inference to have drawn from the roaring of cannon & discharge of
    musketry. I have never seen as many smiling countenances since the war as I
    saw that evening. The gentlemen of Baltimore dined at the court house &
    drank many patriotic toasts in the evening. There was an elegant
    illumination through this town, at least I thought it elegant, as I never
    had an opportunity of a similar scene. In fact, Nancy, patriotism was ablaze
    through the town, & I should experience very agreeable emotions, could I be
    induced to believe that it was the genuine rejoicings of Whiggish hearts
    exhibited to public view in the light of candles. But as the old adage is,
    'we must hope for the best, the worst will come.' I had almost forgot to
    tell you that the presence of the ladies added considerably to the
    illumination.” <br><br>The author was likely Henry Ridgely Jr. (1758-circa

    Ann Ridgely (1759-1850) would soon marry Dr. Francis Brown Sappington (see

    In early 1782, with the fighting in North America almost done, the war
    continued in the Caribbean with a planned French assault on the British
    colony at Jamaica. In the Battle of the Saintes, the French and British
    fleets faced off near the island of Dominica over several days in April
    1782, resulting in a humiliating defeat for the French. Many thousands of
    French sailors and soldiers were killed or captured, six ships were lost
    including their flagship, and their commander the Comte de Grasse was
    captured to be paraded before King George. The remaining French ships
    scattered in a desperate retreat, straggling back to port at Cap-François
    (now Cap-Haïtien in Haiti) over a period of weeks. <br><br>Offered here is a
    contemporary French listing of the first wave of 20 French ships to limp
    back into Cap-François on 25 April. The list is dated 12 May, although 4
    additional ships not listed here arrived on 11 May. <br><br>The list is

    Benjamin Day (1746/7-1794) of West Springfield, MA graduated from Yale in
    1768. In 1776, when many of his former classmates were already fighting for
    independence, he went to the southwest frontier to help establish a British
    presence in Natchez territory, a newly claimed part of West Florida in what
    is now southern Mississippi. The leader of this expedition was a fellow Yale
    loyalist, Major Timothy Dwight, Class of 1744. Day was soon commissioned as
    a British major himself. The British settlement at Natchez failed within a
    year; Day moved on to British-held Savannah and St. Augustine. <br><br>At
    the end of the war, Day returned to Massachusetts, and drafted this petition
    to the state's congress: "Your petitioner was formerly an inhabitant of this
    state, but left it in April 1776 as an adventurer to settle himself and
    family on the river Mississippi . . . until the year of 1782, when the
    savages becoming troublesome he left it with a determination of returning
    immediately to this commonwealth . . . and wishes to become a subject
    thereof." He requests to become a naturalized citizen of Massachusetts.
    <br><br>The request was granted and he became a successful wool dealer and
    hat manufacturer, resuming his place in the New England elite. Per his entry
    in "Biographical Sketches of the Graduates of Yale," four of his
    great-grandsons followed him to Yale.

    This treatise on the future of American architecture was released as plans
    were being selected for the iconic Smithsonian Institution building in
    Washington. It was prepared "on behalf of the Building Committee of the
    Smithsonian Institution" by the chair of the committee, Robert Dale Owen
    (1801-1877), a former Congressman from Indiana who had secured funding for
    the project three years earlier. See lot 143 for another work by Owen.
    <br><br>This copy bears a gift inscription from James Renwick Jr.
    (1818-1895) "to his friend Franklin W. Smith." Renwick was the brilliant
    young architect of the Smithsonian Institution and New York's Grace Church,
    who had lent his drawings of both projects to be engraved for this book. He
    signed without a "Jr.," but the signature is his rather than that of his
    architect father, suggesting that the inscription was done after his
    father's death in 1863. The recipient was Franklin Webster Smith
    (1828-1911), who had been a young abolitionist before the Civil War and
    later became interested in public architecture. In 1890, Smith delivered
    lectures in favor of a massive National Gallery of History of Art; Renwick

    gift of this book may date from this 1890 collaboration. The gallery was

    American explorer Elisha Kent Kane's Second Grinnell Expedition from 1853 to
    1855 failed to find Sir John Franklin, but reached a new "furthest north"
    and discovered the northernmost channel between Canada and Greenland. The
    journey broke Kane's health and he died in 1857. This lecture program,
    enhanced by a panorama by artist George Heilge and a diorama, toured across
    the United States and Canada to capitalize on popular interest in the
    expedition. Kane's navigator Thomas Hickey narrated the adventure "in
    Esquimaux Costume," accompanied by two sledge dogs which survived the
    expedition. The front of this broadsheet is mostly devoted to newspaper
    testimonials on the show, while the verso lists the entire 122-point
    program, from the Advance's departure from New York, Greenland scenery, "a
    desperate conflict with bears," "Graves of poor Schubert and Baker by
    moonlight," the return of the survivors to civilization, and Kane's death
    and funeral. <br><br>This broadsheet advertises three dates at "Junior Hall"
    from 18 to 20 September. This was very likely Junior Hall in Frederick, MD,
    with the printer being the Frederick Herald. Kane died in 1857, one of the
    testimonials is dated 1859, and 1860 was the next year which fits these
    dates on the calendar.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The renowned Hudson River School painter Albert Bierstadt (1830-1902) was
    just becoming established as a landscape painter in 1859 when he first went
    west to accompany an Army transcontinental railroad survey. The resulting
    sketches from this and later trips were transformed into epic canvasses
    which made him perhaps the best-known artist of the American West by 1863.
    Offered here is a letter of recommendation which Bierstadt secured from the
    Secretary of War, helping to make this first trip possible. <br><br>"The
    bearer of this note, Mr. A. Bierstadt, who proposes to accompany Colonel
    Lander's wagon road party, has been introduced to me as an artist and a
    gentleman of character, and as such I commend him to the courtesy and kind
    attention of the commanders of such military posts as he may visit."
    <br><br>The letter writer, John Buchanan Floyd (1806-1863) of Virginia,
    provided active assistance to the secessionists as Secretary of War, and was
    later investigated for conspiracy and fraud; he later served disastrously as
    a general in the Confederacy.

    Milford Zornes (1908-2008) was a well-established watercolor artist on the
    California art scene before being drafted into the Army for World War Two.
    This scrapbook begins with a letter from George Biddle of the War Department
    Art Advisory Committee, anointing him as "one of a small group of
    outstanding American artists to go to an active war theater, and there to
    obtain a graphic record of the war. . . . Our committee expects you to be
    more than a news gatherer. The importance of what you have to say for the
    historian of the future will be the impact of the war on you, as an artist,
    a human being." Zornes was sent to China, Burma, and India, where he
    sketched scenes of civilian life. Included are 20 original pencil, ink or
    watercolor sketches by Zornes; 22 additional photographs of his art; 52
    retained copies of V-Mail photographic letters sent home to his wife, many
    of them illustrated; 27 other letters; and 70 pieces of ephemera ranging
    from his 3-page itinerary of postings, to supply lists, to theater programs,
    to military personnel memoranda, to lists of art supplies. A rich
    documentary record of a key period in the career of a significant artist.

  TYPESET: >-
    Several hundred items (0.6 linear feet) in one portfolio box; generally only
    minimal to minor wear.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    If you have arrived at Swann's Americana catalog in search of Civil War
    diaries and Declaration of Independence broadsides, this next lot will
    probably not be for you. <br><br>Stuart Alan Horn (1946-2008), a
    Philadelphia artist and musician, was a prominent member of the mail art
    scene--an insular world of like-minded outsiders who exchanged Xeroxes of
    enigmatic collages. Some of his creations were distributed under the name
    Northwest Mounted Valise, including a 1975 book of the same name (included).
    Offered here is a large archive of his original maquettes, reproductions,
    correspondence, mail art received from his associates, and more. At the core
    are approximately 60 maquettes of varying degrees of complexity, along with
    a larger number of photocopied reproductions, and other material that was
    apparently intended for use in collage. <br><br>The small correspondence
    file includes a 1973 fan letter from reality show pioneer and gay icon Lance
    Loud; and 3 letters dated 1974-1975 from Baltimore actress Edith Massey (a
    John Waters regular best known as "Edie the Egg Lady" from Pink Flamingos).
    In her 11 March 1975 letter she announces "The picture Female Trouble is
    going to open in Philadelphia next month if nothing happens." <br><br>Horn
    also led several bands on the Philadelphia avant-garde scene such as Stu
    Horn & His Invisible Band, and Horn & Hard Art. Included here are numerous
    show fliers (including some in maquette form), a folder of song lyrics, Horn
    & Hard Art's 1978 album, and its original cover art. <br><br>In Horn's mail
    art circle, work was not always signed or credited. The bulk of this archive
    is stylistically consistent and clearly his; also included are a smaller
    number of zines, newsletters, and mail art which come from other artists.
    Bill Griffith of "Zippy the Pinhead" fame makes 3 appearances with signed or
    stamped work. To provide a tenuous tie-in with Swann's regular Americana
    fare, Griffith is the great-grandson and namesake of Western photographer
    William Henry Jackson (see lot 248). <br><br>A lengthy 2020 reminiscence of
    Horn can be found on longreads.com, "Find Yourself: from way back in ’80s
    Philadelphia, Elizabeth Isadora Gold remembers her first writing teacher,
    the mail art artist/lyricist Stu Horn." Horn also makes numerous appearances
    in the 1995 book "Eternal Network: A Mail Art Anthology," edited by Chuck
    Welch (included). Some of his work is held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art
    and Dartmouth College. <br><br>In short, we offer a box of his stuff. Some
    things can't be explained. Stu Horn probably would not have wanted us to
    try.

  at-a-glance: 'Various places, 1926-1934'
  TYPESET: >-
    Approximately 136 items in 3 folders: 61 original letters to Hiram Bingham
    and others, 44 retained carbon copies of responses, 26 photographs in
    various sizes up to 8 x 10 inches, and 5 pieces of additional ephemera;
    condition generally strong, with occasional minor wear.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The archive documents the long push to create a memorial at Kill Devil Hill
    in Kitty Hawk, NC, the site of the first flights by the Wright Brothers. It
    is the personal correspondence file of Senator Hiram Bingham III (1875-1956)
    of Connecticut, the famed explorer of Machu Picchu who later went into
    politics. Often the letters to Bingham are paired with his carbon copies of
    his typed responses. Many of the letters are from Lindsay Warren, a North
    Carolina member of the House of Representatives who also took an interest in
    the project. The first letter here is Warren's introduction, after learning
    that they had both sponsored similar legislation in their chambers on the
    same day. Warren's 19 September 1927 letter names the members of the Kill
    Devil Hills Memorial Association, including popular pilots Byrd and
    Lindbergh, as well as the semi-obscure former Assistant Secretary of the
    Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt. Other correspondents include Herta Junkers, a
    German woman who headed the American division of her family's Junkers
    aircraft manufacturers; federal budget director Herbert Lord; numerous
    officials in the War and Navy departments; and especially William J. Tate,
    superintendent of the Lighthouse Service and a strong supporter of the
    project. <br><br>William Oscar "W.O." Saunders of Elizabeth, NC headed the
    Kill Devil Hills Memorial Association. He was a local newspaper editor
    renowned for courting controvesy, often on the right side of history--he
    spoke out against lynching and anti-Semitism. His letter of 12 December 1927
    announced that the association has secured 200 acres for the memorial.
    Later, Saunders published an editorial denouncing the memorial plan and
    Senator Bingham's role in the project, so Bingham sent in his letter of
    resignation from the commission. Congressman Warren sent Bingham a letter of
    apology on 28 February 1929: "Mr. Saunders . . . says anything that might at
    the time be on his mind. I know of no one that has escaped his shafts
    including myself. He would walk in your office tomorrow morning and greet
    you with the utmost cordiality and friendship. He has long since stopped
    having enemies in North Carolina." You may know a "loose cannon" like this
    in your own life. In response, Saunders announced his own resignation as
    president of the Memorial Association. <br><br>J.F. Victory wrote on 2
    November 1928 with a design for the site's plaque (photograph included). He
    had included a winged propeller logo at the bottom, explaining that "this is
    an original design with this firm." Stapled to the photo are Bingham's
    notes, suggesting that the National Aeronautic Association logo be used
    instead, and then when told that might delay the project a week, "approved
    leaving insignia off." The plaque which remains at the site today is
    identical to this photograph--except that the logo has been removed.
    <br><br>Three eyewitnesses were brought to the site to determine the exact
    spot where the first flight lifted off in 1903. A photostat of their signed
    affidavit is included. The logistics for a special 200-person dedication
    weekend are also discussed--the area was not then served by roads, so a
    special steamer was necessary. Bingham fought to keep the memorial separate
    from any attached projects for lighthouse, beacon tower, or Coast Guard
    facilities. <br><br>Most of the letters date from 1926 to 1929. A smaller
    group dates from 1932 to 1934, with Bingham in his role as president of the
    National Aeronautic Association (he left the Senate in 1933). The memorial
    was officially dedicated on 19 November 1932. A carbon of a letter to Amelia
    Earhart urges her to attend: "If you can possibly find it practicable to
    change your speaking engagement, it would be most fitting and proper for you
    to accept the invitation to officiate at the unveiling. . . . The matter is
    urgent and of great important to the War Department." The day after the
    ceremony, lighthouse head W.J. Tate recounted the behavior of the guest of
    honor at length: "Orville Wright ran true to form, looked bored and kept
    silent during the official glitter." Wright was on the program for the
    official luncheon but stayed at Kill Devil Hill with a few locals "who knew
    him in the old days of struggle . . . and honestly, if he didn't enjoy
    himself his looks belied his feelings." He only showed up at the luncheon
    after the other guests had eaten and left. Tate also bemoans that the
    original Wright Flyer--"the greatest souvenir of the greatest epoch-making
    event in all the history of the human race, lies in a foreign museum" (see
    the previous lot, from a different consignor). <br><br>In addition to the
    correspondence, a file of photographs includes copy prints of historic
    1901-1903 photographs and original photographs of ceremonies in 1928 and
    1932. Ephemera include a sounding map of the Outer Banks area, annotated to
    show the coverage of nearby lighthouses for the Kitty Hawk site; an 8-page
    pamphlet, "Kill Devil Hills Memorial Association, Its Genesis and Its Aims,"
    circa 1927; and a printed program for the 17 December 1928 pilgrimage
    event.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    William Armstrong "Bill" Price (1915-2009) was discharged as a United States
    Navy bomber pilot after World War Two, and became a reporter for the New
    York Daily News, where he convinced the paper to acquire a military surplus
    plane to take aerial photographs. He also bought a series of surplus planes
    for his own personal use and became interested in what he termed "the
    synoptic eye," discerning the patterns shaping American life which could
    only be seen from above. He became inspired by a 1953 book by George
    Stewart, "U.S. 40, Cross Section of the United States of America," and later
    recalled his desire to "take a sample of the whole country all the way
    across, but it needed something to hold it together and Highway 40 seemed
    the way to do it." Price's ultimate plan was a massive illustrated book
    showing the nation from sea to sea--although he never secured a book deal. A
    committed progressive, his unofficial theme songs for the project were
    "America the Beautiful" and Woody Guthrie's "This Land is Your Land."
    <br><br>U.S. Route 40 then stretched across the continent from Atlantic
    City, NJ to San Francisco, CA, passing through 14 states. It traversed major
    metropolitan areas such as Baltimore, Columbus, Indianapolis, St. Louis,
    Kansas City, and Denver, as well as long stretches of farmland, and the
    Appalachian and Rocky Mountain ranges. The route superseded important early
    routes such as the National Road (launched in 1811) and the 1921 Victory
    Highway, and parts have since been replaced by sections of interstate
    highways I-80 and I-70. The portions which remain are still known as the
    "Main Street of America." If you have travelled widely in the United States,
    you have almost certainly spent some time on this road. <br><br>On 18 August
    1954, Price and his friend Bob Bedell took off from Pennsville, NJ in a
    surplus Consolidated Vultee L-13 and headed west as far as daylight allowed
    each day. They reached the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco 24 days
    later, having taken 938 exposures. Price sold the plane and camera, and
    returned to New York. Hoping to fill in some gaps, he bought another surplus
    plane and camera (a Stinson L-5 and a Keystone F8, respectively) and left
    with friend Jane Hogg on 22 September 1955. This 18-day trip faced weather
    and mechanical challenges and got no further than Kansas before turning back
    to New Jersey, but added another batch of photos to his file. <br><br>These
    photographs--and the epic project behind it--are wonderfully described in a
    January 2000 article in the Smithsonian's Air and Space magazine by John
    Fleischman, "A Flight Along America's Highway: One Man's Mid-Century
    Portrait of the United States--from 1,500 Feet," for which Price was
    interviewed at length. Why did Price undertake this challenging project?
    "I've been trying to figure that out myself. . . . I think it's something
    like, I'm in love with America. I know that sounds kind of crazy 'cause I'm
    very critical of what the U.S. is doing these days, but get away from the
    cities and the political centers, then you can see the land and what kind of
    impact we've had." <br><br>Price lost almost all of his negatives and
    detailed trip logs in an apartment fire in 1994. Offered here are his nearly
    complete file of contact sheets and large prints, which were not affected by
    the fire: 232 sheets of contact prints (including occasional duplicates),
    each 14 x 11 inches, with 4 worn binder punch holes along the left edge
    sometimes extending slightly into the images; most sheets have at least
    minor to moderate edge wear, some with crop marks in red pencil; housed in a
    period briefcase hand-lettered "William A. Price Aerial Photography." Most
    sheets have 6 images, some have fewer. Reference numbers are written in the
    negatives of the margins of each image, but not dates or locations. The
    original logbooks are lost, so determining the locations of each image would
    be a substantial piece of detective work. Photocopies of 5 scattered log
    pages do survive, covering 95 different images, showing the time, altimeter
    reading, and a short caption for each; these will provide a good starting
    point. The negative reference numbers are nearly complete from 494 to 1856,
    with eight sheets from the sequence apparently missing; a note explains that
    one was given away in 1988. The set of contact sheets is accompanied by
    additional prints and supporting documentation:<br><br>Approximately 200
    photographic prints of aerial views, most about 14 x 11 inches, a few
    smaller. Most of these are apparently from Price's 1954 and 1955 Route 40
    trips, and from a 1953 trip to Iraq and Syria, and at least one is from a
    1951 trip to West Virginia. A small number bear Price's inked credit stamp
    on verso, but most are uncaptioned and uncredited. 4 of them are mounted on
    board. <br><br>Aircraft log for Price's Stinson L-5, begun in 1952 by a
    previous owner, with 4 pages signed by Price in 1955 and 1956, including his
    daily itinerary notes from 20 to 30 September 1955 from New Jersey to Kansas
    City. <br><br>19 sleeved negatives with typescript dates, numbers, and
    captions which survived the 1994 fire, though the sleeves show light smoke
    exposure. All are dated 17 August 1954, between Havre-de-Grace and Ellicott
    City, MD. <br><br>Printed material, including: Price's copy of George R.
    Stewart's 1953 book "U.S. 40, Cross Section of the United States of
    America," which served as a partial inspiration for the project, in worn
    dust jacket with tape repairs; January 2000 issue of Air & Space magazine
    featuring article on Price; folder of clippings on aerial photography and
    related subjects, most circa 1955-56. <br><br>A hard drive with scans of the
    contact sheets. <br><br>Finally, and perhaps most importantly: Keystone
    Aircraft-Type F8 model camera with a Wollensak 15-inch lens, wooden handles,
    and viewfinder, approximately 13 x 14 x 15 inches; minor wear including a
    bit of paint flaking, apparently in good repair but functionality not
    tested. This was the camera used for Price's shorter second Route 40
    expedition in 1955.

    3 Autograph Letters Signed, each a bit under 10 x 8 inches (3, 4, and 2
    pages in length): two from David Curry to his wife Mary Priscilla, and one
    from John Curry to brother David, the earliest letter with a worn address
    panel featuring an inked San Francisco postmark; first letter worn with loss
    of a few words, other two letters with minor wear.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    David Curry went to the gold fields, as many did, as a partner in an
    incorporated mining company. The first letter is dated from Sacramento on 15
    July 1849. It describes the trip over, and how his Roe Mutual Association
    became defunct: "Before we came to San Francisco it was understood among the
    most of us to dissolve the Association for reasons that we thought that
    their was too many together & too many officers & most of all their was too
    many that did not like to work." They sold their schooner and divided their
    provisions--"every man goes on his own hook." Another association led by
    Colonel Zabriskie had also failed: "His party of 25 is all bust up & every
    man for himself." Curry then formed a small party with 5 other New Jersey
    men. His party plans to head out for the Yuba River for the season: "The
    most of us came out to make money, we must do the work. A man with a
    starched coller will not make his fortune here digging gold, but the red
    flannel & hickory shirt & one that is willing to work can get some gold."
    <br><br>His 23 December 1849 letter is dated simply from "California," and
    describes his trip up river "to the mines (they call it here going to see
    the elephant)" where "4 of our company got scared at the elephant, turned
    round & went back to Sacramento." Curry spent three months working for
    another miner, tried to ship out on a steamer to Hawaii when rainy season
    hit, but then returned to mining at Mormon Island near Sacramento. There he
    was working for his original Association partner Mr. Poole, who was running
    a store, intending to stay there through the spring. He describes the mining
    regions as "a hard-looking place, you generly dig down from 5 to 10 feet,
    full of stones the ground is, then take your dirt to the river & wash it in
    a rocker just like a cradle & the gold settles to the bottom. I send in this
    letter a small piece for to remember me by." We should make 100% clear that
    the gold fleck is no longer present with the letter. <br><br>Finally, a
    letter is addressed to David Curry from his brother John Curry, who had also
    gone west for mining. It is dated at Mokelumne, 16 November 1856: "I bought
    a interest in a mineing claim close to the flume but two weeks after buying
    the water got so low in the flume that we could not get water. . . . We
    don't shovel much dirt in the boxes as we ground sluce. It is a very fast
    way of working dirt."

    Edwin McMasters Stanton (1814-1869) is best known as Secretary of War during
    and after the Civil War. He was a successful Pennsylvania attorney with no
    national reputation until 1858. With a friend serving as President
    Buchanan's attorney general, Stanton was selected to travel to California to
    represent the administration in the complex Limantour land claims. This
    letter was written on a steamship, six days before his arrival in San
    Francisco. He discusses preparations for a high-profile patent case,
    McCormick vs. Manny, in which the famous inventor of the reaper was suing
    Stanton's client. Stanton discusses the difficulty of writing out legal
    briefs on an ocean steamer during a gale, and documents his journey at
    length: "Our engine had the same accident during the gale of Monday &
    Tuesday that occasioned the loss of the Central America, but it was
    discovered early . . . to prevent disaster. . . . We suffered no other ill
    consequence as yet but being badly frightened--that I consent to." Four days
    later, just before arriving in San Francisco, he describes another storm in
    which "the sea sloshed over our hurricane deck, knocked in the ports, poured
    into the state rooms, and frightened everybody generally." Stanton's work in
    organizing and analyzing the existing Spanish land records soon gained him
    the trust of the Washington insiders, leading to appointment as Buchanan's
    attorney general just two years later. <br><br>WITH--a related printed

    Diary of a rail trip through dozens of towns in southern California, from
    Fresno down to San Diego.
  at-a-glance: 'Various places, 27 February to 18 April 1898'
  TYPESET: >-
    [84] manuscript pages. Original 8vo illustrated wrappers, bound at top,
    minimal wear; 7 blank leaves neatly excised at end, minimal wear to
    contents.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This diary records a trip by rail through much of California. The author is
    a seasoned lone traveler from the northeast on an annual winter trip. He
    seems to be looking for a Californian paradise with one eye, and looking for
    an excuse to mock the Californian dream with the other. He is often critical
    of climate, hotel accommodations, and potential for agriculture, but seems
    to be enjoying his constant travels despite himself, and offers a high level
    of descriptive detail. His mode of operation was to stay for several days in
    a town and make long day trips by rail. The diary starts on the train
    passing through Ventura. His first base of operations is Santa Barbara, from
    where he visits the local mission, Montecito, Carpinteria (seeing the
    world's largest grape vine), and drought-stricken Naples: "at one large
    ranch near Naples, four men are employed to go about the ranch and skin the
    cattle as fast as they starve and die." Next was a stop in Fresno: "I took a
    walk out to the Chinese quarter and found lots of the cusses" and then
    passed through the red light district: "I got service salutes from the
    girls, but paid no attention to them" (6 March). From there he headed toward
    the coast. At a layover in Tracy, "did not get any dinner at all as the
    place is a small one, and rum is the principal article there for sale. The
    hotels are no good." (circa 8 March). Pacific Grove was his next base of
    operations. The hotel in Pacific Grove "is kept by a Dutchman and is very
    skimpily run. The proprietor is more afraid of serving a sufficiency of grub
    than an ordinary man is of the smallpox" (13 March). From there he saw
    Monterey and Point Lobos.<br><br>A short stop near Los Angeles yielded
    descriptions of Pasadena ("do not think I saw any place that would please me
    as a home . . . a slow sort of place, nothing to do but talk orange") and
    Santa Monica. San Diego was next, "too new for a desirable place to live . .
    . It will be many years before San Diego will be a pleasant-looking place"
    (21 March). From there on 22 March 1898 he visits La Jolla and "Ramona
    House, an old tumble down adobe, the house of the hero of . . . Helen Hunt
    Jackson's Indian story" (which is apparently the running theme of our fall
    Americana auction--see the next two lots), and then Tijuana across the
    border on the next day, where "the train is met by Reuben the guide (a
    Cleveland Negro) who runs some four horse stages from the depot to the
    village." San Bernardino was his next extended stop, where he marveled at
    the extent of the orange groves but after repeated sampling declared that
    the product does "not begin to compare in flavor with the Florida oranges"
    (29 March), reiterating the next day "these California oranges haven't any
    business with Florida fruit." He visited Highland, Redlands, and Riverside,
    as well as the famed Squirrel Inn in the mountains, where he got lost in a
    snowstorm and nearly had to sleep outdoors. Finally he stayed briefly at
    Pomona and Los Angeles, from where he headed east on 8 April. His only stop
    on the return journey was in Colorado Springs, and he arrived in New York on
    18 April to conclude his diary. <br><br>Also included is a second diary of
    17 pages, 5-26 October 1898, by the same author, on a camping trip in the
    north country to hunt partridges. References to Mud Pond and Chamberlain
    Lake suggest the Allagash Wilderness in northern Maine. 3 unused period
    postcards from towns described in the California diary are also included.
    <br><br>We've been unable to pin down the authorship of this interesting
    diary. It concludes with the initials G.G.G. A careful perusal of the hotel
    register reports in local newspapers on his arrival days shows two promising
    matches. The San Diego Union and Bee of 22 March 1898 shows a G.G. Gunnell
    of Denver checking in at the Hotel Brewster, and the Daily Times-Index of
    San Bernardino of 28 March 1898 shows a G.G. Greenwell of Chicago checking
    in at the Stewart. Both of these are likely our man. Whether he enjoyed
    slightly disguising his name, or the newspapers exercised a sloppy
    transcription of the registers, we can find no appropriate Gunnells or
    Greenwells in the census records.

    Large archive of Robert E. Callahan and his famed Mission Village auto court
    / theme park.
  at-a-glance: 'Various places, circa 1901-79'
  TYPESET: >-
    Hundreds of items housed in 5 scrapbooks and several folders, housed in one
    large box (1.2 linear feet); condition varied, with the scrapbooks worn and
    coming disbound, and the guest book / scrapbook heavily chipped at edges
    with some loss of text.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Robert E. Callahan (1892-1981) was the proprietor of Mission Village and
    then Indian Frontier Village from 1928 into the 1970s--well-known tourist
    attractions which operated somewhere on a spectrum between motels, museums,
    and theme parks. Callahan was born in Virginia with some Iroquois ancestry;
    he performed with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show as a boy, did some acting,
    wrote novels and screenplays, and then found success in the advertising
    world in Chicago. This enabled him to launch his dream in 1928, the Mission
    Village Auto Court in Culver City just north of Los Angeles. It was based
    loosely on the popular novel of the American Indian, Ramona by Helen Hunt
    Jackson (see lot above). In 1962, the land was appropriated for a freeway,
    and Callahan launched the similar Indian Frontier Village in the Mint Canyon
    neighborhood of Santa Clarita, further to the north. This village slowly
    became defunct as Callahan aged; he was still trying to find a buyer upon
    his death in 1981. Portions are now owned by the Santa Clarita Valley
    Historical Society. <br><br>This lot includes 7 scrapbooks of varying sizes
    kept by Callahan, plus some additional papers. One scrapbook contains mostly
    Mission Village promotional materials and advertisements, circa 1931-1942.
    Another is described as a guest book and does include extensive guest
    inscriptions from 1936 to 1949, but also photographs and correspondence. A
    more composed photo album includes shots of American Indian athlete-actor
    Jim Thorpe on a film set, and a Callahan production staged for the 1935
    World's Fair (both illustrated). A publicity shot of Roy Rogers and his band
    (Sons of the Pioneers?) is captioned "Roy Rogers, who in 1933 was Leonard
    Sly, and whose first rodeo experience was in his dad's show at Ramona
    Village"--a story we cannot confirm. Two smaller photo albums contain mostly
    older images from Callahan's early careers and journeys, about 3 x 4 inches.
    One includes a distant view of the famed 1910 Jim Jeffries - Jack Johnson
    boxing match in Reno, NV. Two large leather portfolios contain larger photo
    prints, and tourist brochures collected from similar attractions. An
    occasional older photo makes its appearance, such as a chipped well-known
    group shot including Geronimo and General Nelson Miles from 1901.
    <br><br>Also included in this collection are two of Callahan's original
    screenplays, "The Girl Outlaw" and "The Boy Jockey"; a file of
    correspondence from 1961 to 1979, mostly regarding the launch of the Indian
    Frontier Village and the final effort to sell it in 1979; and a file of
    Mission Village promotional materials. All in all, this is a rich archive on
    a quintessential mid-century Californian phenomenon.

  TYPESET: 42 items in one portfolio box; condition generally strong.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    John Fujio Aiso (1909-1987) of Burbank, CA was a graduate of Brown
    University and Harvard Law School. He was drafted into the Army in 1941 as a
    private and assigned to teach Japanese to officers at the Military
    Intelligence Service Language School. He became director of academic
    training and was commissioned as lieutenant colonel by the end of the war.
    The 6,000 graduates of his program were credited with an important role in
    winning the war and securing the peace. After the war, he served as a judge,
    culminating in a seat on the California Court of Appeal. He has been
    inducted into the Military Intelligence Corps Hall of Fame, and the library
    at the Defense Language Institute is named in his honor. <br><br>This lot
    includes 18 commissions, letters, and other honors received by Judge Aiso.
    Most notable are his oversized New York bar certificate from 1935; his
    California bar certificate from 1941; his army discharge certificate from
    1947; his 1983 commendation from the City of Los Angeles signed by Mayor Tom
    Bradley; and 3 copies of an abstract of his 1983 appearance in the
    Congressional Record. <br><br>The photographs in this lot include 6 prints
    of Aiso standing with then-governor Richard Nixon, along with the negatives;
    2 prints from the Moulin Rouge in Hollywood; a group of 11 8 x 10 prints
    from various events in his career; and 2 large formal portraits by Los
    Angeles photographers Elson-Alexandre and Gladser Studios. <br><br>Also
    included are 3 printed items: February 1956 issue of Asia Scene magazine

    remnants at corners, inked manuscript correction with slight ink burn.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The massive project to lay the first transatlantic telegraph cable was
    launched in 1854 by the New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company.
    With a line already in place from New York to Nova Scotia, the long stretch
    across the Atlantic from Newfoundland to London was the longest and most
    technically challenging, and the 65-mile stretch from Nova Scotia to
    Newfoundland also drew attention. Then there was the matter of laying more
    than two hundred miles of cable across the southern coast of
    Newfoundland--rugged and sparsely populated terrain carved by inlets, and
    even today largely untouched by roads. <br><br>This broadside aimed to find
    a large temporary labor force among the scattered subsistence fishermen of
    this isolated coast. Agents for the company were eager to sign contracts
    "with any parties who may be desirous to complete the Bridle Roads and
    Bridges, get out and distribute Poles and Braces, and distribute Wire."
    Laborers from the more populated parts of Newfoundland were advised to
    "establish themselves in Bay de North, and Bay Despear, to Conn River, in
    Hermitage Bay . . . Cing Cert Bay, La Poile Bay, Guria Bay, Grandy's
    Passage, and Port-aux-Basques." Roads and bridges were to be completed by 1
    January 1856, with poles and braces in place by 10 March. The engineer
    promised that "there is work enough for four hundred able-bodied men for 6
    weeks." No other examples of this ephemeral broadside have been traced.

    This archive tells the story of a group of Canadian gold mines owned by
    Boston investors Sumner Stanley and Charles E. Eddy. The mines had been
    claimed and platted by Charles F. Eschweiler of Milwaukee in 1892, and
    developed from 1898 onward. The mines were all located in and near the
    remote town of Rat Portage (since mercifully renamed Kenora) in the western
    corner of Ontario, with the largest properties surrounding Hilly Lake and
    others located on islands in Lake of the Woods to the south. <br><br>The 8
    maps show the location of the mining properties in question. One is a small
    color plan on tracing vellum, and the other 8 are blueprints, most of them
    with some hand-coloring, the two largest being duplicates measuring 36 x 35
    inches. Among the other papers, most notable is a small notebook titled
    "Description of Canadian Gold Lands" summarizing transactions on the
    properties from 1892 to 1896. Also included are correspondence and
    typescripts of the mining patents; an account for machinery dated 1898;
    assay reports from 1892 and 1898, and some tangentially related estate
    papers. All told, an interesting gold-mining archive from a lesser-known
    mining region.

    This eye-catching patriotic broadside featured an entirely hand-colored flag
    as its centerpiece. The title quotation comes from Treasury Secretary John
    A. Dix from an official order he issued on 29 January 1861. Though issued in
    relation to the specific case of a revenue cutter threatened by
    secessionists, it became a general rallying cry for Union loyalists in the
    early months of the war. In the upper corners are matching cuts of a cannon
    and flag captioned "The only compromise with traitors." The lower half is
    dedicated to the text of three patriotic songs: "The Star-Spangled Banner,"
    "Hail, Columbia! Happy Land!," and "Red, White and Blue" (better known as
    "Columbia, Gem of the Ocean"). The latter appears as a pair of slips pasted
    over the original printing--whether as replacement songs or correcting an
    errata, we do not know. We trace no other examples of this elaborate
    production in OCLC, at auction, in Filby & Howard's "Star-Spangled Books,"

    On 2 November 1861, President Lincoln removed John Frémont as commander of
    the Department of the West, leaving the Missouri campaign in the hands of
    little-known Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant, a West Point graduate.
    Reporting to Grant although bearing the same rank was Brigadier General John
    McClernand, a political appointee and old friend of Lincoln's from Illinois.
    Five days later, Grant led his two brigades on a surprise attack on a small
    Confederate base in Belmont, MO, across the river from a larger base in
    Columbus, KY. The Confederate camp was routed and destroyed, but
    reinforcements soon arrived to rout Grant's forces in turn; Grant himself
    barely made it back aboard the transport ship. <br><br>Offered here is
    McClernand's official report to Grant on the battle, written five days
    later. The two generals barely knew each other at this point, but grew to be
    bitter enemies as the war progressed. Here, McClernand does his best to
    ingratiate himself with Grant. Describing the bravery of his troops early in
    the battle, McClernand notes that "this gallant conduct was stimulated by
    your presence and inspired by your example. Here your horse was shot under
    you." McClernand also describes the death of his Polish-American
    aide-de-camp, Captain Alexander Bielaski. <br><br>Below the printed text on
    the final page, an unknown reader pokes fun at McClernand's self-promotion
    and egotism through a simple word count in manuscript: "Principal

    on the east bank of the Mississippi River, where General Grant's division
    landed, with a view to re-inforcing Major General Sherman from that point.
    Let there be no delay. Send them by brigades as rapidly as they can be

    corps was indeed moved rightward to Sherman's XV Corps in time for the 22
    May assault. Brigadier General James A. Tuttle's division played a
    significant role in the battle under Sherman. As the repeated assaults
    against the formidable Confederate fortifications drew to a close, Sherman
    would order Tuttle: "This is murder; order those troops back."

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Ulysses S. Grant began the Civil War as a colonel, but rose quickly through
    a series of dramatic victories and the support of President Lincoln and
    Secretary of War Stanton. On 2 March 1864, Lincoln made him a Lieutenant
    General in command of the entire Union army--a rank not held by any officer
    since George Washington. Grant arrived in Washington to receive the honor on
    8 March, and formally received the promotion at a cabinet meeting the
    following day. <br><br>Stanton was obviously delighted with the appointment,
    and this card serves as evidence. Above Grant's stern visage are inscribed
    the names of three of his greatest victories (with Fort Donelson
    misspelled): "Donaldson, Vicksburg, Chattanooga," with "Major General Grant"
    inscribed in Stanton's hand below. On verso, Stanton has signed the card
    just days after the appointment: "With regards of Edwin M. Stanton, March
    11[?], 1864." <br><br>It's obviously very unusual to find a photograph of
    one important historical figure, signed by another. We don't know who
    Stanton signed this card for, but it seems clear that he was using the card
    to boast about "his" new commanding general. Three years later, Grant would
    temporarily replace Stanton as Secretary of War, a move which triggered
    Andrew Johnson's impeachment hearings.

    Autograph Letter Signed as "J.H. Simpson" to brother Dr. Josiah Simpson in

    envelope (postmark clipped).
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Colonel James Hervey Simpson (1813-1883) was a West Point graduate and one
    of the original officers in the United States Topographical Engineers; he is
    most often remembered for his work in mapping and exploring a route across
    Utah in 1858. He commanded the 4th New Jersey Infantry from the start of the
    Civil War until his capture at the Battle of Gaines' Mill under the command
    of General McClellan. Upon his parole from Libby Prison, he went back into
    topographical work. During the presidential campaign of 1864, he spoke out
    publicly against McClellan, who he suspected of being a Confederate
    sympathizer. <br><br>This letter was addressed to his brother, who had
    apparently quested the wisdom of calling the possible next president a
    traitor: "You may think me injudicious in the correspondence I have had with
    regard to McClellan, but believing I am in duty bound as a citizen of the
    U.S. to give the public any facts which I may have bearing on his past
    conduct which will show his unworthiness for the position of President, I
    have not hesitated to put myself before the public as I have. . . . He was
    insincere towards the government, and from this source have flown all the
    disasters which our army met with on the Peninsula of Va. The developments
    that are being made relative to the Sons of Liberty, that they were banded
    together to break up the government & aid the Confederates; that they were
    in secret conclave in the Richmond House at Chicago, at the same time the
    Democrats were holding their convention; that Vallandigham presided at these
    meetings and was the go between of the two bodies, all go to show that there
    was a regular plot to break down the government, and McClellan committing
    himself with Pendleton & men of his opinions & acts, certainly show that he
    was either a dolt or designedly disloyal." <br><br>WITH--two accompanying
    publications which quote Colonel Simpson's views on McClellan, as alluded to
    in the letter: <br><br>"Gen’l McClellan’s Record. His Sympathy With the
    South.” 12 printed pages, 9 x 5½ inches, on 3 stitched folding sheets;
    folds, minimal wear, with the beginning and end of Simpson's contribution
    marked in ink, and a lone correction made in pencil. This pamphlet was
    issued late in the election campaign, apparently by Cincinnati Republican
    activist Edgar Conkling, in an effort to discredit McClellan. It features a

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The April 1862 Battle of Shiloh (or Pittsburgh Landing) in southwestern
    Tennessee began with Confederate plans for a surprise attack at dawn. Union
    Colonel Everett Peabody became suspicious and sent out a pre-dawn 250-man
    reconnaissance patrol which engaged with advance Confederate troops at 5:15
    a.m. This gained a few critical minutes for Union troops to brace for the
    assault. Horace Newton Fisher (1836-1916) of Massachusetts was a Union staff
    officer at the battle, and was eager to correct the historical record on the
    details of the battle. <br><br>Colonel Peabody, whose reconnaissance played
    such a key role, died in the battle that day. His nephew Frank Everett
    Peabody (1856-1918) of Boston had possession of the colonel's papers and
    corresponded with Newton about the battle. This extremely detailed letter
    analyzes Peabody's role in the battle, incorporating these new primary
    sources, and concludes that "had it not been for Col. Peabody's soldierly
    development of the enemy's line," the Confederates would have "found
    Prentisss' camp & sentinels asleep & powerless to have resisted for even ten
    minutes, in which case the entire Federal camps would have been captured
    long before noon on Sunday." Newton's manuscript map shows the Confederate
    attack at 6 a.m., with farm fields, division commanders on both sides,
    roads, creeks, and headquarters all clearly depicted. <br><br>Accompanying
    this letter are 4 typescripts on the battle authored by Fisher. Most notable
    is "In Regard to when the Battle of Shiloh Commenced" in 13 pages with
    extensive revisions in Fisher's own hand, noting that "this personal
    reminiscence is given by request of Mr. Frank E. Peabody of Boston, by
    dictation to his stenographer," 16 May 1903. The corrected typescript
    incorporating these revisions is also included. This essay was copyrighted
    by Fisher's son in 1954. Also included is a 12-page typescript, "Gen.
    Beauregard at Shiloh," dated 6 April 1903 (possibly unpublished) and a
    9-page typescript, "Gen. Lew Wallace's Attack on Grant's Memory on the
    Shiloh Battlefield," 8 April 1903 (also possibly unpublished, with related
    news clippings attached).

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Eluctius William Treadwell Sr. (circa 1836-1865) served in the 19th Alabama
    Infantry. From the Army of Mississippi's large encampment at Corinth, he
    describes the results of three nearby battles and reflects on the future
    struggles for a Confederate victory in the war. <br><br>First he describes
    an unnamed skirmish: "We have had some fighting not far from this place and
    killed from what they say some 40 Yankees and captured 6. . . . Our men
    drove them into their boats, though they tried to stop our men by retreating
    and drawing them in until they could with their infantry cut our men off. .
    . . The Yankees landed at a place called Eastport and have quite a number of
    men and gunboats. It is said they are 50,000 strong and are building a road
    to bring their artilery to this point. . . . Beauregard is cutting off the
    gunboats that are up this river, I mean Tennessee River. If we can do that I
    will be pretty well satisfied." Two weeks later, the Confederate Army of
    Mississippi would launch a surprise attack from its Corinth base in what
    became the Battle of Shiloh. <br><br>Treadwell also offers what he has heard
    about the recent Battle of Pea Ridge: "We got the best of it. . . . At last
    acct Price had cut off the enemy's baggage and was on one side with his
    army, and Pike on the other with 6,000 Indians and surrounded on another
    side by an impenetrable wilderness." On the Battle of Fort Donelson, "I have
    seen men that was in that fight, and they say we was not whipt at all, but
    was surrendered without our consent or knowledge. . . . Some cried like
    children, while others would tear down the white flag evry time they put it
    up for 3 successive times."<br><br>Finally, Treadwell makes predictions
    about the future course of the war: "I am sorry to know that some of our
    people are becoming faint at our recent reverses. As for my part, I expected
    such things and we will suffer more than this before our independence is
    won. . . . I expect this war will last for years. After some few months from
    this time, Lincoln will offer us some kind of wrights, which I hope we will
    not except unless it be to let us alone to enjoy our freedom just as we see
    fit. After he finds we will except nothing, he will then in my opinion rally
    all the force he has and come against us, and there will be the greatest
    battles of the world." <br><br>This letter is unsigned, apparently because
    the author ran out of space and time--he concludes with a hasty line of
    cross-writing on the first page, suggesting an imminent attack: "We are
    throwing up breastworks." Another signed letter by Treadwell written a week
    later was found on line (copy included).

  TYPESET: '2 items, as described.'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Alcée J. Toutant (1836-1905) settled in San Antonio, TX as a young man,
    began the Civil War with a Texas regiment, and later became an aide-de-camp
    to Mansfield Lovell, the disgraced major general who had surrendered
    Louisiana and spent the rest of the war without a command. He finished the
    war as aide-de-camp to his famous uncle, General Beauregard--more properly,
    Pierre Gustave Toutant-Beauregard. Alcée's obituary reported that "Much of
    the strategy displayed by General Beauregard was the outgrowth of

    conferences between himself with his nephew." <br><br>The earlier of these
    two documents is Lieutenant Toutant's letter to Confederate General Samuel
    Cooper (1798-1876), asking whether he was entitled to cavalry pay as an
    aide-de-camp. Though Cooper played mainly an administrative role as Adjutant
    and Inspector General, he was technically the top-ranking general in the
    army, senior to Lee, Beauregard and the rest. Cooper inscribed and signed
    his response in the docketing on verso: "All aides de camp are entitled to
    cavalry pay as lieutenants. June 23/63, S Cooper, A & I G." One page, 9¾ x
    7¾ inches, plus integral blank with docketing; minimal wear. Richmond, VA,
    23 June 1863. <br><br>The other document is a pass issued to Toutant, signed
    by his famous uncle and commander, reading "Pass Capt. A.J. Toutant A.D.C.
    on his way to Shreveport & San Antonio & back. G.T. Beauregard, General."
    Beauregard was at that point in command of defending against Sherman's March
    to the Sea, which by then had nearly reached Savannah--an odd time to send
    his aide on leave to Texas. One page, 6¼ x 8 inches; separations at folds at
    margins of signature, skillfully backed with tissue. Montgomery, AL, 2
    December 1864.

    Approximately 205 contemporary manuscript pages, all sleeved, plus 74 pages
    of modern transcripts, in one binder; rough drafts, but condition generally

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This regiment had more than the usual share of interesting history. Its
    founding colonel until his September 1861 promotion was Lew Wallace, who
    later became a Major General, and then after the war authored the novel
    Ben-Hur. They distinguished themselves in Tennessee at Fort Henry, Fort
    Donelson and Shiloh, served in the Siege of Vicksburg, and closed out the
    war in the Army of Shenandoah. The 11th Indiana is probably unique among all
    Civil War regiments in having a professional sports team named in their
    honor: the Indy Eleven of the North American Soccer League. <br><br>Unlike
    many less distinguished regiments, the 11th Indiana did not produce a
    self-appointed regimental historian who published a thick unit history after
    the war. ("Three Years with Wallace's Zouaves: The Civil War Memoirs of
    Thomas Wise Durham" did make it to press in 2003). George A. Simmons
    (1839-1925) made a considerable effort toward filling that void. He worked
    as a printer in Indianapolis before the war, enlisted with the 11th as a
    corporal in its initial incarnation as a 3-month regiment, re-enlisted as a
    sergeant for a three year term, and mustered out as a second lieutenant in
    December 1864. After the war, he became an official in the Department of
    Treasury in Washington. <br><br>This memoir by Simmons does not aspire to
    being an official regimental history. It is largely told in the first
    person, and makes only brief accounts of the periods when Simmons was away
    from the regiment--he was captured at the May 1863 Battle of Champion's Hill
    and not exchanged until the end of August, and then mustered out before the
    regiment's uneventful last few months of garrison duty. However, it does
    apparently rely upon research in the published records to keep his
    chronology straight. It contains numerous interesting anecdotes--navigating
    by the call of a lone whippoorwill while out on picket duty, Colonel
    Wallace's creation of a mounted scouting squad to track enemy movements, the
    initial adoption of a colorful zouave uniform which was "soon discarded for
    the dark-blue regulation uniform," the unit singing "John Brown's Body" as
    they marched through Harper's Ferry, sitting on picket duty after the first
    day's fight at Fort Donelson and hearing the cries of the wounded on the
    battlefield, and much more. Wallace's drill tactics of "keeping up a
    continuous fire and advance" are credited for "great saving in casualties .
    . . notably the case in the approaches to the works of Fort Donelson." The
    manuscript is numbered erratically from pages 10 to 118 plus two appendices,
    with several generations of editing marks, covering the entire period of the
    regiment's active service. It was likely written after his retirement from
    the Treasury Department circa 1915-1920. <br><br>Also included are two
    shorter works by Simmons. A fragmentary essay titled "General Sheridan's
    Shenandoah Valley Campaign" concludes with a tribute to fallen comrade
    Captain John P. McGrew; and an untitled 40-page essay on his Treasury
    Department work documents his mistreatment toward the end of his career. A
    most helpful lightly edited modern typescript of the two Civil War works is
    included with the lot. <br><br>Also included are 4 quartermaster returns
    retained by Simmons from the regiment dated September to December 1864; an
    official printed Army order from 1886 amending his official service record;
    a small unmounted albumen photograph of Union soldiers tearing up railroad
    tracks; and a circa 1900 mounted photograph of an older bearded man in
    military uniform, presumably Simmons.

    "There is something about a review that no person can describe. It is grand
    and sublime beyond description. We were reviewed by Major General Howard,
    and just as we had got through, General Billy Sherman appeared on the field,
    then we had to be reviewed by that noble hero. Our division was drawn up
    around the edge of a large field, and when Sherman rode out into the field
    to acknowledge our salute, feelings that I cannot describe completely
    overcame me. Cynthia, I for the first time in my life or nearly the first

    Oliver Clum Lasher (1829-1894) of Hackensack and Fort Lee, NJ joined the

    letters dated 28 February 1864 describes how he found himself in command of
    the gunboat USS Young America without receiving a promotion. He had been
    left ashore to tend the mail, but "as the Young America got to the flagship,
    her captain could not handle her to suit the fleet captain," who asked "what

    April 1864, describes a recent Confederate torpedo attack on the USS
    Minnesota: "About 2 a.m. a small propeler about as big as a shad decked over

    with her. She passed the U.S. Steam Ram Atlanta . . . and was hailed by her

  CROSSHEAD: Correspondence and poetry of a Bull Run private with a literary bent.
  at-a-glance: 'Various places, 1861-62, 1880 and undated'
  TYPESET: >-
    24 items in one folder: 6 Autograph Letters Signed to his sister Augusta

    envelopes; one additional letter transcript; 5 letters received from
    Augusta; 7 undated manuscript poems; 4 printed poems in handbill or clipping
    form; and a manuscript eulogy upon his death; generally minor wear.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Elisha Norman Gunnison (1837-1880) was raised in Charleston, MA and served
    as a private in the 2nd New Hampshire Infantry until his disability
    discharge in January 1863. He was a prolific poet during and after the war.
    His letters home are more enthusiastic and patriotic than most. In his first
    undated letter, he thanks "God that he made me able, and gave me the will to
    fight for this glorious cause"; he describes "scouting through the bushes
    nights, to pick off Rebel sentries." Not long before Bull Run, he expects to
    "have a big fight soon . . . expect a glorious fight." On 13 July he
    announces that "we are to lead the attack on Manesses Gap under Brigader
    General Burnside; we are impatient for the fight, victory is perching on our
    banners." <br><br>Four days after the First Battle of Bull Run, he writes "I
    have just come out of the hottest battle ever fought on American soil. . . .
    Our regt was all cut to peices, second in battle, last out." Despite the
    loss, "got a sword taken from a man I killed." <br><br>On 31 December 1861
    he discusses a poem he had written "entiteled Sic Semper Tyranis, that is
    Lattin for so allways to tyrants." This was years before John Wilkes Booth
    made the phrase a lost-cause rallying cry. On 3 May 1862, camped near
    Yorktown just before the Battle of Williamsburg, he describes the bravado of
    his regiment while being shelled: "Our boys are standing round makeing
    observations as coolley as can be. If a shell don't come far enough, they
    will sing out 'A little more powder, Johney,' and if it goes too far they
    say 'Shot to far that time, try it again.'" Also included is a manuscript
    transcript (in a much tidier hand) of Gunnison's 1 June 1862 letter to Mr.
    W.H. Thomes, editor of the American Union newspaper of Boston, submitting a
    poem for publication along with his impressions of the Battle of
    Williamsburg. <br><br>Gunnison's letters received from his sister are more
    compelling than most letters from the home front. Her 28 July 1861 letter in
    the wake of Bull Run is inspirational in its depiction of the Union troops,
    and urges Lincoln to "do our work by proclaiming liberty to the enslaved . .
    . who at this present crisis has done all the work of the South, not the
    whites, they have not the muscle nor the energy." <br><br>Gunnison's poems
    include the printed broadsides "To Our Sister in Heaven" and "His Last Poem:
    As One Whom His Mother Comforteth," neither of which appear in OCLC; a
    clipping of his poem "The Battle of Bull Run" as published in the
    Charlestown Advertiser; as well as apparently unpublished manuscript poems.
    Finally, a manuscript tribute to Gunnison was written in 1880 by a Virginia
    minister whose home was on the battlefield at the Battle of Malvern Hill;
    his family had been saved by Gunnison's kindness and heroism.

    wear to contents; signed on front flyleaf. With a complete typed transcript
    and index.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The Rev. James Hoyt (1817-1866) was a graduate of Harvard who settled in
    Orange, NJ as a Presbyterian pastor in 1856. He joined the Christian
    Commission after the end of fighting, but had several unusual adventures. He
    arrived to his posting with XIV Corps in Washington on 25 May 1865, and five
    days later found himself ministering to hospitalized soldiers, "one with a
    paralyzed condition of the lower limbs, one negro soldier with a pain in the
    head, as from neuralgy." Hoyt was an avid genealogist and had determined
    that General Sherman's mother was a Hoyt. He made two efforts to meet
    Sherman (see 31 May) to invite him to the next family reunion, but in vain.
    He did come away with a detailed description off Sherman's headquarters camp
    (page 17). On 31 May, he visited the Mary Surratt house where the Booth
    conspirators had met, and describes it in careful architectural detail; he
    later visited the courtroom for the trial of the conspirators on 10 June,
    getting a glimpse of Mrs. Surratt. His 1 June sermon in memory of Lincoln is
    summarized, and on 2 June he witnesses a "sham battle" in which an entire
    31st and 82nd Ohio regiments fired all of their guns while their officers
    were out of camp, sparking sympathetic volleys from other regiments across
    the division. He recounts tales of a band of a thousand prostitutes which
    had followed the Army from Nashville, and had been shipped back by train
    after they had "bred the most horrible & destructive disease." A corps
    review led by General George Thomas is described at length on 4 June, as is
    his distribution of the famous temperance tract "The Black Valley Railroad"
    to a crowd of eager sinners at a grog shop on 6 June. Perhaps most
    noteworthy are his moving accounts of the religious meetings he led among
    the soldiers after one soldier offered his testimony, "he wept, and all the
    sympathizing assembly of veterans, hard worn & sunburnt, but not callous of
    feeling, melted in tears" (1 June). <br><br>On a much less uplifting note,
    Rev. Hoyt's entry from the evening of 6 June is headed "Threatened by a
    Soldier Mob." A crowd of drunken soldiers from the 75th Indiana stormed the
    Commission's supply tent, upset that two Black soldiers had been given
    shirts, while one of their compatriots had been turned down: "They claimed
    that the money paid by their friends & others to the C.C. was meant for the
    soldiers (i.e. the white) & not for the niggers." The ministers stood firm
    with the help of some sober soldiers nearby, and the mob walked off
    muttering. The next day the "ringleader of the rowdies" returned to again
    request a shirt, and on 8 June they were menaced by a group from Company J
    of the 17th Ohio with the exact same complaint. When denied, the leader
    struck at the tents with a club, yelling "Then let's down with the d___d
    thing" and lifted his club to strike Rev. Hoyt; they later threw one of his
    fellow ministers to the ground and tore his coat. <br><br>In the rear of the
    volume are 2 pages of notes on specific soldiers who were ministered to
    (name, regiment, next of kin, and personal notes); 2 pages of inscriptions
    by his fellow chaplains; and 3 pages of notes on the history and
    organization of Sherman's army. <br><br>Provenance: found by the consignor's
    grandmother in an old house in Albany, NY circa the 1940s, and given to the
    consignor circa 1980.

    Augustus Wilder Sargent (1840-1894) of Boonville, NY on the western edge of
    the Adirondacks mustered in as a private with the 117th New York Infantry,
    and was a corporal by the time of this diary. He had been injured in the
    Battle of Chaffin's Farm, and the first month of this diary was written
    while on leave recuperating in his hometown. En route to his regiment, he
    stopped at Point of Rocks, MD, where he visited the photo gallery (10
    February) and "discovered the first louse today since I left home" (11
    February), and then stayed in Hampton, VA for a month while his transport
    ship was mired in mud. He did not reach his regiment in North Carolina until
    14 March, when he joined the march on Goldsborough. His regiment undertook
    vigorous foraging in the countryside, "bringing in sweet potatoes and meat
    and a general assortment of everything" (22 March). Four days later, he went
    out with two men: "In the course of three or four hours we returned with all
    the meat and potatoes we could carry." <br><br>The dramatic events of April
    are duly noted. "The news of the fall of Richmond was received hear this
    forenoon with great joy by all" (6 April); "About 1 pm we received the news
    of the surrender of Lee" (12 April). On 15 April the regiment occupied the
    city of Raleigh; our diarist visited the capitol and lunatic asylum. Not
    until 18 April did he note "a report has been in circulation that the
    President has been killed, but it has been contradicted. It cast a gloom
    over the whole camp." News of General Johnston's surrender was received on
    27 April, bringing the war in the east to an end; the next night "rockets
    are being thrown up all over the city . . . it seems like the fourth of
    July." Sargent mustered out on 8 June and made his way back north to
    Boonville.

    William Tomlinson (1823-1863) was born in England and became a newspaper
    editor and publisher in Ripley, OH near Cincinnati. Though he had been an
    active Democrat before the war, he supported the Lincoln administration.
    After serving as a captain in an Ohio regiment, in 1863 he began publishing
    the Loyal Scout, a "Union Campaign Paper." On 29 November 1863, he and his
    son got into a heated political argument with a Kentucky man named Mitchell.
    Mitchell then shot Tomlinson with a pistol, fatally wounding him. The son
    then stabbed Mitchell with a pen knife. The family's story has been told in
    Pat Donahue's 2014 book "The Printer's Kiss: The Life and Letters of a Civil
    War Newspaperman and His Family" (copy included), which publishes many of
    the family's letters but not these. <br><br>Offered here are 8 letters
    between Tomlinson, his widow, their children, and an uncle. Two were written
    by Tomlinson in Cincinnati in 1860; three were written to him by his
    children in 1863. One of those was written on the letterhead of the Loyal
    Scout. Another, by his son William Byers Tomlinson on 8 November 1863,
    discusses efforts to collect on delinquent subscription accounts in Ripley,
    and discusses local Unionists: "Sim Myers . . . is still for the cause all
    the way through. . . . I would like to see that list of Rebel voters in
    Marion township published." On 17 January 1864, Mrs. Tomlinson received a

    This Union private, who had mustered into the 109th Pennsylvania Infantry
    just 10 weeks before, presents a glowing account of the string of victories
    the Union army has inflicted on Stonewall Jackson's cavalry in the
    Shenandoah Valley--quite contrary to the judgement of history: "We are under
    General Seigles [Sigel]. He is a little man and sandy complected but you had
    better believe he understands his business. We had a little fight at Charles
    Town a few days before we left Harper's Ferry. . . . we lossed only about 10
    men. They retreated first and we chased them through the town. We halted
    just before the steam printing office whare they printed Rebel papers . . .
    and we got lots of military books that they had taken from our men, and then
    we burnt the printing office down. . . . The next day they advanced on us
    and began fireing on us, but by that time we was reinforced with a great
    many artilery. . . . General Fremont is on the rear of them, and us at the
    front, and they will have to fight thare way through some how or be taken
    prisoners. . . . General Jackson is the old rascal we are fighting with. He
    has about thirty thousand rebels. . . . We are ready any time at all for
    Jackson. We are under Seigler, and as soon as he undertakes Fremont, Seigle
    will come in on the rear of him. If he only new it, he is in a pretty bad
    fix." Private McFarland still had full confidence in President Lincoln's
    months-old plan to catch Jackson's cavalry between a hammer and the anvil of
    Frémont's Mountain Department. However, by this point the fighting had
    ended, Frémont was already in withdrawal, and Stonewall Jackson was soon to
    march eastward unencumbered toward the Virginia coast. <br><br>The letter
    also includes an intriguing line which we have been unable to corroborate:
    at the skirmish in Charles Town, WV, "we took the old rascal prisoner that
    hung John Brown. He is locked up in Harper's Ferry." Brown's hangman was
    John Avis, who did indeed serve the Confederacy in the 5th Virginia, but by
    June 1862 he was provost marshal of Staunton, VA, and we find no mention
    that he was ever captured. By all accounts, he treated Brown with decency
    during the prisoner's final days.

    Sarah Rosetta Wakeman (1843-1864) was one of the very few women to serve in
    the Union Army, enlisting under the name Lyons Wakeman in the 153rd New York
    Infantry. Her regiment spent most of its time in tedious garrison duty at
    Alexandria, VA, but was ordered south for the Red River Campaign in February
    1864. There she survived the Battle of Pleasant Hill, but died of illness in
    New Orleans the following June. She was buried as Lyons Wakeman, and her
    story did not become generally known until the discovery of her letters in
    1976. <br><br>Offered here is a letter by Sergeant William Henry Austin
    (1840-1914) of the 109th New York Infantry, who knew Wakeman from childhood,
    and was one of the few soldiers who knew her enlistment story. He was
    nonetheless surprised to meet her by chance in Alexandria. "When I was going
    to the depot in Alex[andria] I stopped at the Soldier Rest. Who should I
    meet there but Rosetta Wakeman? Her reg was stopping there, at that time
    were en route for Texas. She was looking fine. Sports an insipid moustache,
    highly colored, presents quite a soldier's appearance. There is something
    mighty queer about this arrangement. There is rottenness in Denmark
    somewhere (mum about this). She wanted to know all about my interview with
    her father. I told her what I felt disposed and what I didn't, kept to
    myself. Hardly think she will ever get back to New York again." <br><br>The
    Austins were from Harpursville, a village in Colesville Township in Broome
    County--a town bordering the Wakeman family farm in Afton in Chenango
    County, NY. The two families lived no more than a few miles away, and knew
    each other well. <br><br>Austin is mentioned several times in Wakeman's
    letters home to her parents, as published in the 1994 compilation, "An
    Uncommon Soldier: The Civil War Letters of Sarah Rosetta Wakeman, alias Pvt.
    Lyons Wakeman," pages 43-49, 57, and 65 (copy included with the lot). On 20
    September 1863, she wrote her parents: "Can you find out what company Henry
    Austin is in, and where to direct a letter to him? I have been gone one year
    and I haven't seen a man nor a woman that I ever seen before I left home."
    On 13 October 1863, she mentions a prior meeting with Austin at his camp
    near Georgetown: "I got a man to row me across the river to the island and
    then I found Henry Austin and Perry Wilder. They knew me just as soon as
    they see me. You better believe I had a good visit with them." Finally, the
    same meeting Austin described is mentioned in her letter of 2 March 1864: "I
    saw Henry Austin in Alexandria, Va. and bid him good-by for the last time."
    A photograph of Austin appears on page 57 of the book. <br><br>We have not
    yet seen any other letters referencing the women soldiers of the Union Army.
    This is quite a rare discovery.

  DESCRIPT: (CIVIL WAR--WOMEN.) Mary Whitney Phelps.
  CROSSHEAD: Partial memoir by the celebrated civilian hero of Missouri.
  at-a-glance: 'No place, late 19th century'
  TYPESET: >-
    1-9, 13-26 leaves of an ink manuscript fair copy with pencil edits, 25 x 8
    inches, each folded horizontally and blank on verso, followed by an
    additional worn smaller leaf of an earlier pencil draft numbered 27 and 28;
    apparently lacking leaves 10, 11, and 12, otherwise minor wear.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Mary Whitney Phelps (1812-1878) was one of Missouri's Union heroes of the
    Civil War. Her husband John Smith Phelps (1814-1886) of Springfield, MO
    represented Missouri in the United States Congress, but returned home to
    fight for the Union at the outbreak of the rebellion. The 10 August 1861
    Battle of Wilson's Creek, the first major battle west of the Mississippi,
    was a defeat for the Union and resulted in the death of Union commander
    Nathaniel Lyon. The Confederates under General Sterling Price soon occupied
    Springfield. Rather than flee with other prominent Unionists, Mrs. Phelps
    remained behind in Springfield to see to the burial of the fallen General
    Lyon, and to care for wounded soldiers who had been left behind during the
    retreat. The Missouri chapter of the Daughters of Union Veterans is named in
    her honor; she was also the subject of a 2008 biography, Jerena East
    Giffen's "Mary, Mary Quite . . . The Life and Times of Mary Whitney Phelps."
    <br><br>This apparently unpublished manuscript memoir begins with an extract
    from the Congressional Globe of 27 July 1866 (pages 4227-8) in which she was
    granted $20,000 as reimbursement for her services, followed by her preface
    explaining that "the object of this work is to correct some mistaken ideas
    which have been published to the world in newspapers regarding this
    appropriation, why it was made, and how expended."<br><br>The manuscript is
    missing three leaves, including any discussion of the Battle of Wilson's
    Creek, but resumes on leaf 13 with her discussion of the burial of General
    Lyon. With the Confederate army expected in town in six hours, she hunted
    down the town's only remaining coffinmaker, an old man who had retired from
    business for lack of assistants, and was terrified of angering the
    Confederates. She selected the wood, gave him a four-hour deadline, "then I
    went home to have a grave dug. I set my gardener, an Irishman, and a Negro
    man to work at it," and returned to town to watch over the body, embalming
    it herself with bay rum. A 3 p.m. "the rebels began to pour into town,
    yelping like wild Indians. The yard and house were filled in an hour, so
    that it was impossible to move about. I took my stand by the dead body. . .
    . Some were chasing the fowls, others were in the garden pulling up
    vegetables, and others stripping the peach and apple trees." A rebel
    commander brought them to order with a pistol shot, explaining with a laugh
    "that is the only way I can make them d___d rascals obey my orders." The
    coffin was completed, but the grave had not been dug--two more days passed
    before she laid the general to rest. <br><br>The Confederate General Price
    then sent an aide (actual name Major J.T. Major) to clear the encamped
    rebels from her home, and brought her to a church where the Union wounded
    had been warehoused: "Oh, the horrible sight! They were thrown upon the bare
    floor almost in piles; some dead, others dying, and some in a state of
    nudity" (leaf 18)--much their clothing had been confiscated by ill-clad
    rebel troops. Mrs. Phelps and a handful of other local Union women assumed
    responsibility for the surviving wounded: "Five days after the battle, I
    removed to my house thirty wounded soldiers, all privates, and very badly
    wounded. The officers generally had money, and could find those who would
    nurse them for pay, but the poor privates had neither money, nor a change of
    clothes." With the help of her enslaved servants, she had them all bathed,
    and fed them bread, milk, and peaches. Her servant George was captured and
    imprisoned by the rebels, with plans to send him south, but she went to the
    rebel camp to rescue him (back into servitude), a story told at great
    length, closing her narrative. <br><br>The narrative was composed in the
    first person by Mary Whitney Phelps. We have been unable to find comparisons
    for the handwriting. The earlier fragments of the pencil draft could
    plausibly date from the lifetime of Mrs. Phelps (who died in 1878) and are
    quite possibly in her hand. The ink fair copy is in a different hand and
    looks somewhat later. <br><br>WITH--4 additional leaves of the original

    This diary was written by a wealthy young man taking an extended tour of
    America; it is headed "Book Seventh, Continuation of Journal in America."
    The entirety of this volume was written in various Connecticut towns, all of
    which met with the author's derision. He describes two tiresome days in a
    Stafford, CT hotel designed for invalids (11 August 1832), a conversation
    with an Andrew Jackson fanatic in Vernon, CT, who enthused "I never seen him
    in all my life, but I know him as well as if I did. Isn't he filling the
    atmosphere with his story!" (13 August), a Yale commencement (14 August),
    and militia training day in Norwich, CT, where "the ludicrous appearance of
    the soldiers was enough to kill the souls of laughing adversaries" (3
    September). After a year in the young nation, he commits a diatribe to
    paper: "I dislike the Americans as a nation but not for their ludicrous
    customs, to them established by usage, nor for their erroneous
    pronunciation. . . . I contemn the nation for their concealed fondness for
    aristocracy, and outward dislike towards it. I dislike their consummate
    vanity and overweening self-conceit. I abhor their Jacobin creed and despise
    the impudent freedom of their lower classes. I pity their cupidity and
    jealousy, and feel vexed at their obstinate eulogy. Their country is
    magnificent and has incredibly advanced in prosperity & improvement, and
    will be no doubt the greatest of nations if it holds together, but at
    present it is a mere child" (4 September).<br><br>The diary is unsigned, but
    the author would seem to be Farquhar Macrae (1808-1838), son of Scottish
    native Colin Macrae who had settled as a sugar planter in Guyana. The best
    clue is on the sixth page of the diary, when an old friend greets him
    "Macrae, how are you?" He mentions his Aunt [Margaret van den Heuvel]
    Ingersoll in New Haven on 14 August, and plans to visit a sister in Florida
    [Charlotte Macrae Vass] in September. Farquhar Macrae settled in Florida
    soon after the period of this diary, had some of his letters to the Farmer's
    Register published, and drowned in 1838 while trying to rescue a fellow
    passenger on a steamboat.

    This volume was the personal copy of class member Samuel Davis Page
    (1840-1921) of the Class of 1859, a Philadelphia native who later served as
    Assistant Treasurer of the United States. Many of the inscriptions are
    addressed to him, including his own satirical description, which he signs as
    "Your best friend or (it may be) your worst enemy." Page was captain of the
    crew team, which is discussed in many of the entries. Referring to this
    service, classmate Thomas Brainerd wrote "You have gained the foremost rank
    in the most distinguished navy in the world!" An original photograph of the
    six-man crew posed with their vessel appears near the end of the volume; it
    is attributed in one of the entries to well-known New Haven photographer
    Major Moulthrop. <br><br>Most members of the class, who were of prime
    fighting age for the Civil War, lived well-documented and eventful lives. A
    few examples who inscribed this book include the class valedictorian
    Lieutenant Edward Carrington Jr. (1838-1865), who survived many battles
    before dying on the battlefield in March 1865. Thomas C. Brainard ran a
    Union military hospital. Daniel Bowe and T. Edwin Ruggles both went to Port
    Royal, SC in 1862 to run cotton plantations under Union military rule.
    Hezekiah Watkins served under Sherman in the Atlanta campaign; his entry
    here waxes rhapsodically for four pages about the big victory over Harvard,
    and discusses the crew's group portrait featured at the end of the volume.
    Diodate Hannahs was killed with the 6th New York Cavalry at Williamsburg in
    1862; his entry here quotes Tennyson's "Charge of the Light Brigade." On the
    other side were Robert A. Stiles of Kentucky, whose memoir of life as a
    Confederate officer was titled "Four Years under Marse Robert"; and Peter
    Vivian Daniel, who gave his life at Chickamauga as captain of the 5th
    Kentucky Infantry regiment. <br><br>Closing out the volume are two
    lithographs: "Yale, the Burial of Euclid," and "Initiation Yale Freshmen,
    Secret Societies," depicting outrageously costumed students above a pile of
    skulls and bones.

    Herald and General Advertiser issued from 24 January 1787 to 30 January
    1788; followed by 164 of of the 179 issues of Dunlap's American Daily
    Advertiser from 6 June to 31 December 1791), each 4 pages, plus a one-sheet
    supplement dated 31 March 1787. Folio, contemporary ½ calf, moderate wear;
    47 issues of the Herald and 121 issues of Dunlap's are lacking one or more

    occasional later check marks in blue pencil many of the Herald issues marked
    with subscriber's name in upper margin, some issues folded before binding,
    minimal dampstaining toward rear.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The Pennsylvania Herald and General Advertiser was founded by the important
    magazine and atlas publisher Mathew Carey of American Museum fame, and was
    taken over starting with the 3 February 1787 issue by William Spotswood.
    Spotswood's editor was Alexander Dallas, later a cabinet member in the
    Madison administration. <br><br>The great subject of national interest
    covered in this volume was the Constitutional Convention which ran in
    Philadelphia from May to September 1787. The 30 May issue reports that the
    convention's delegates have named George Washington as their leader, and
    added "the decisive effect it must have upon the peace and prosperity of
    America, though everything should certainly be given to prudence and
    deliberation, not a moment can be spared to useless forms or unprofitable
    controversy." Editor Dallas apparently had a source from within the rather
    secretive proceedings. In reply to rumors that the convention was setting up
    a new monarchy, his source explained that "tho we cannot, affirmatively,
    tell you what we are doing; we can, negatively, tell you what we are not
    doing--we never once thought of a king" (18 August 1787). On 8 September:
    "We hear that the Convention propose to adjourn next week, after laying
    America under such obligations to them for their long, painful and
    disinterested labours, to establish her liberty upon a permanent basis, as
    no time will ever cancel." On 18 September they reported that "the federal
    convention, after having concluded the important and difficult task of
    framing a federal system of government, broke up; and many of the delegates,
    we are informed, are already on their way to communicate to their anxious
    constituents the result of their deliberations. . . . We trust every friend
    to the peace and prosperity of America, is prepared to receive with respect,
    and to consider with candour, the propositions which will then be divulged."
    The Pennsylvania delegates were of course able to present the results to
    their home legislature more swiftly than those from other states, and thus
    the Constitution was first unveiled to a larger audience in the Pennsylvania
    General Assembly on 18 September at 11 a.m.<br><br>The 20 September 1787
    issue prints the Constitution in full, as it was presented to the states for
    ratification (the text had first appeared in five Philadelphia daily
    newspapers the previous day). Benjamin Franklin, one of the delegates and
    also the sitting President of Pennsylvania, introduced the new creation to
    the assembly: "We have now the honor to present to this house the plan of
    government for the United States. . . . We sincerely hope and believe that
    the result . . . will tend to promote the happiness and prosperity of this
    commonwealth in particular, and of the United States in general."
    Pennsylvania's debates over ratification fill the October through December
    1787 issues. <br><br>This volume is full of interest even behind the
    momentous launch of the Constitution. The culmination of Shays' Rebellion is
    covered in the first months of this volume. Benjamin Franklin, as president
    of the state, appears frequently in these pages. His proclamation on the
    apprehension of the Shays' Rebellion rebels, signed in type with the state
    seal, appears in the 17 March 1787 issue. The ordinance creating the
    Northwest Territory is printed in full in the 25 July 1787 issue. A long
    article on the Montgolfier balloon ascensions spans the 20 and 24 October
    1787 issues. Discussion of the abolition of the slave trade is interspersed
    with advertisements for runaway slaves. <br><br>Per the Library of Congress,
    the last known issue of the Herald was issued just two weeks after this run
    ends, on 14 February 1788. Most of these Herald issues are marked in the
    upper margin for original subscriber "J. Bloomfield Esq.," very likely New
    Jersey Attorney General Joseph Bloomfield (1753-1823), who later served as
    the state's governor. <br><br>The rear of the volume contains issues of
    Dunlap's American Daily Advertiser from June to December 1791. A
    black-bordered obituary of patriot-printer William Bradford appears in the
    28 September 1791 issue; President Washington's State of the Union address
    appears in the 26 October 1791 issue.

    Charles Keating Tuckerman (1827-1896) was raised in a distinguished Boston
    family, and directed the New York Institution for the Blind in the 1850s. In
    1868, he was appointed as the United States Minister Resident to Greece--the
    first American diplomat stationed in Greece, and forerunner to the modern
    ambassador post. Tuckerman became friendly with George I, the young king of
    Greece (a group of personal letters from the King to Tuckerman will appear
    in Swann's 28 October Fine Books and Autographs auction). He resigned his
    post in 1871, and returned to America to publish "The Greeks of To-day" and
    other books. <br><br>A file of 76 letters and autographs includes many
    letters received during his time as Minister to Greece, including several
    letters in Greek; a transcript of Andrew Johnson's letter to the King
    introducing Tuckerman; and letters signed by William Seward, Hamilton Fish,
    Bishop Alexander Griswold, William Ellery Channing, Rufus Choate, Lydia
    Sigourney, George Peabody, and diplomats Abbott Lawrence, Eugene Schuyler
    and John Bigelow. 7 pages from Tuckerman's outgoing letterbooks include an
    1869 denunciation of the controversial diplomat William James Stillman.
    Tuckerman asserted that Stillman was "paid considerable sums of money" by
    the owner of a Greek shipping firm," made "more reprehensible as he was at
    the time a Consul of the United States in Crete." A packet of "Valuable
    papers" includes a partial manuscript for his apparently unpublished essay
    "Our Foreign Service," typescripts and manuscripts of several of his poems,
    and clippings on his career as an author. Another packet includes calling
    cards, invitations and menus from his period in Greece; one manuscript menu
    is marked "Sat on the King's right at Corfu." Tuckerman's small scrapbook of
    newspaper clippings extends from 1857 through his 1868 appointment to
    Greece, with several clippings in Greek. A packet of 50 cartes-de-visite
    includes numerous family members, but also Greek and other European
    diplomats. The earliest material in the lot is a bundle of 50 numbered
    compositions which Tuckerman wrote at Boston Latin School, 1837 and 1838.
    <br><br>Also included are some papers of Tuckerman's two sons. New York poet
    and lawyer Fleming Tuckerman (1858-1923) was the author of "War Poems in
    French and English" (1917). This lot includes a file of 50 letters addressed
    to him, 1888-1924, most of them lightly tipped to loose scrapbook leaves.
    Most of the letters relate to relations with Europe during the era of the
    first World War, including numerous letters from Congressmen--4 from Henry
    Cabot Lodge. Fleming received a letter from the Greek minister to the United
    States on 19 November 1918, thanking him for his continued friendship to
    Greece, and assuring him that the newly deposed Kaiser Wilhelm would never
    be an official guest in his nation: "Every Greek would protest against such
    a destination of even an infinitesimal particle of their country. The sky of
    Corfu on the other hand is too beautiful to bear the presence there of the
    man who is responsible of such havoc as spread over the world during the
    last four and half years." Wilhelm would indeed take up an extended
    residence on Corfu in the coming years. Fleming's brother Arthur Lyman
    Tuckerman (1861-1894) was a promising scholar of European architecture who
    published 3 books in his short life. A file of 23 architectural watercolors
    and pencil sketches, some or all of them by A.L. Tuckerman, are from 1881
    and undated. More randomly: 3 ink sketches by the artist Hen'-a-Te of Zia
    Pueblo in New Mexico.

  TYPESET: >-
    Approximately 230 items (0.5 linear feet) in one box, mostly personal
    letters written by Ambassador Thayer and his wife to their mothers;

    to Thayer's personnel file only.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Robert Helyer Thayer (1901-1984) graduated from Amherst College and Harvard
    Law, and embarked on a wide-ranging career which intersected with the
    Lindbergh kidnapping case, the D-Day landings at Normandy, and the founding
    of the United Nations. This archive of family correspondence dates from his
    diplomatic career as Assistant Ambassador to France, 1950-1954 and as
    Ambassador to Romania, 1955-1957. During his time in Romania, the Soviet
    Union used Romania as its entry point for crushing the Hungarian Revolution
    in October-November 1956. <br><br>From the period when Thayer served as
    Assistant Ambassador to France, 1950-54, are approximately 66 letters to his
    mother Violet Otis Thayer (1871-1962) in Boston. This was the final period
    of both American economic support for France via the Marshall Plan, and for
    the French battle against Vietnamese independence. <br><br>Thayer's time as
    Ambassador to Romania has even more documentation, including approximately
    55 letters to his mother. His 25 October 1956 letter was written just two
    days after the start of massive student demonstrations in neighboring
    Hungary--a momentous development for a committed Cold Warrior like Thayer,
    although he was disappointed that the Romanians did not follow their lead:
    "What exciting times we are living in. . . . I only wish the people here had
    the spunk that the Poles and Hungarians have but they are perfectly supine.
    Someone said today that the churches here were full of people praying that
    the same thing would happen here as in Poland. . . . If all the people that
    were in the churches were out in the public squares protesting instead of
    asking someone else than themselves to help they might be free. . . . It is
    infuriating to be amongst them when people just next to them are having the
    gumption to stand on their hind legs and die for their personal liberty. . .
    . One only has to live a very short time in this Communism to realize how
    inevitable it is that the forces of evil shall be replaced." <br><br>On 6
    November after the Hungarian revolt had been crushed, he wrote "Here we are
    so heartbroken over Hungary that it is terrible. The stories of the bravery
    and willingness to die of those boys is wonderful and a proof that Communism
    can never last. . . . People can't help being sure that Communism is dying
    the natural death that everyone knew it would. . . . There are signs of
    decay that are very exciting. Tomorrow is the Soviet holiday but nobody is
    going near them. They can celebrate all by themselves and drink themselves
    into sodden despair for all I care." <br><br>His 13 November letter offered
    more details after communicating with the locked-down American legation in
    Hungary. He described the movement of Soviet troops through Romania and saw
    that his efforts to draw the Romanian government slowly toward capitalism
    was for naught: "They have to be taught that to deal with us they have to
    keep their hands clean and get away from the Soviets." He proudly describes
    snubbing the Soviet ambassador at the airport: "He looked very embarrassed
    since this was in front of a great many people and I may say that I enjoyed
    his discomfiture." On 29 November he described dining with the long-serving
    Romanian Communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, "the Khrushchev of
    Rumania, and had the pleasure of telling him what the American people
    thought of the Soviet actions in Hungary." <br><br>Also from Romania are 45
    letters from the ambassador's wife Virginia Pratt Thayer (1905-1979) to her
    own mother Ruth Baker Pratt (1877-1965), who had served in the United States
    Congress in the 1930s. These letters are filled with diplomatic gossip. Her
    28 November [1956] letter shares a slice of Iron Curtain life: "While
    walking the dogs I was accosted by a charming older lady who stayed with me
    during the entire walk. She was . . . a most agreeable companion, but we are
    being beset these days by provocatures, in an effort to get charges against
    one of us, and I could not relax in her company. . . . That is the vile side
    of the Soviet orbit. The eternal atmosphere of suspicion of one's neighbor
    finally infects even us, the free and open characters." Her 4 November 1957
    letter describes the suspicious death of Romania's foreign minister Grigore
    Preoteasa (1915-1957) in an airplane crash. Her letters are all accompanied
    by full typed transcripts. Virginia Thayer also wrote a 32-page typescript
    memoir of her arrival and early days in Bucharest which is included.
    <br><br>Also of interest is a carbon copy of a 1973 interview Thayer did
    with Columbia University on his time with the Eisenhower administration,
    with some related permissions correspondence through 1983. <br><br>Rounding
    out the collection are an English-Romanian phrase book, Thayer's diplomatic
    personnel file from circa 1959 through his 1964 retirement, and more. This
    archive offers a deeply personal look into diplomatic life behind the Iron
    Curtain during the Cold War.

    An appeal from the long struggle to complete the Washington Monument, at

    the job done. "It will be astonishing and mortifying, if out of twenty-five
    millions of souls who inhabit this great country, rendered independent,
    prosperous and happy mainly by his exertions and devotion to its cause, the
    sum necessary to erect a monument worthy of such a man could not be
    completed for the want of a small pecuniary aid." The officers and managers
    of the Washington National Monument Society are listed, including President
    Franklin Pierce and Washington mayor John Towers (who took office in June
    1854). We trace no other example of this broadside in OCLC, at auction, or

  CROSSHEAD: Case notebook kept for the Newsboys and Children's Aid Society.
  at-a-glance: 'Washington, DC, 1886-87'
  TYPESET: >-
    [48] manuscript pages. 4to, 8¼ x 6¾ inches, paper-backed marbled boards,

    moderate wear and dampstaining.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The Newsboys and Children's Aid Society of the District of Columbia was
    incorporated in February 1886, and opened its office at 1014 F Street NW on
    24 May 1886, when this volume begins. In reaction to widespread poverty
    among the city's children, their initial goal was to place children in
    informal foster homes, apprenticeships, or orphanages. This notebook was
    kept by one of the society's outreach workers--quite possibly their only
    employee. It is an informal record of children she has attempted to aid,
    sometimes with success but more often ending in disappointment. <br><br>The
    children's stories (both black and white) are almost uniformly bleak.
    Charles Dickens could have used this notebook for source material. In an era
    preoccupied with refined manners, these reports are raw and direct. On 2
    August 1886, "Went to visit Essex Court to see Bennie Carrago about some
    work. He was asleep and his idiotic mother washing clothes in the sink. The
    furniture consisted of a little old stove and two stools with quantities of
    dirt. Bennie was glad of the chance to make fifty cents. As I went from the
    door I was immediately surrounded by at least twenty men, women and boys all
    fighting and yelling like fiends. Deviltry seems to hold high carnival in
    this alley." A report on 10 August was received of "a little girl who lives
    with her mother in one room over a stable in an alley betw. C and
    Pennsylvania Ave. The mother uses the girl to make money, with either white
    or black men. The girl is only thirteen, but will become a mother, but is
    dreadfully diseased." On 21 September 1886 a boy reported that he had walked
    24 miles to the city to escape a dangerous situation: "The man with whom he
    lived kicked him, and struck him over the head with a stick, and he ran
    away. Got him a place to work at a coal yard." On 18 October 1886 we are
    introduced to 14-year-old Cora Littlefield, who had a 23-year-old lover. The
    father showed the aid worker a note from the lover found under Cora's
    bed--the note is pasted in at the rear of the volume. Cora was placed in the
    House of Mercy, but soon escaped: "she thinks of nothing but her bad
    associations." Emily Powell and her eight children lived "all in one bed
    without food or fire . . . the children are barefooted and have little or no
    clothes" but the aid worker could not convince any of the children to seek
    an alternative (6 December 1886). Another mother is described as "a drunk
    and addicted to the use of morphine" (8 February 1887) and a 12-year-old
    girl is described as "a thief, a liar, and a prostitute . . . two older
    sisters have gone the same way." On a rare cheerful note, on 12 August 1886
    the newsboys were brought to an amusement park operated by a Mr. Morley,
    where they took turns riding a roller coaster: "They had a good time
    enjoying the fun and giving cheers for Mr. Morley. After the riding, Mrs.
    Hood and myself headed a procession of boys and thanked Mr. Morley."
    <br><br>Although the organization helped many children too young or ill to
    work, their name suggests a primary interest in newsboys, who were often
    among the most visible and aggressive street children during this era of
    rapidly increasing poverty. We spot only one entry which actually describes
    newsboys in this volume. On 19 February 1887, the worker visits "newsboys
    who had been arrested. There were five colored boys" who "gambled all the
    time" and "managed to elude the police by gathering in small squads to play
    and setting a watch to warn them of the police. . . . The game they play is
    craps, played with dice." Vincent DiGirolamo's recent book "Crying the News:
    A History of America's Newsboys," cites Washington's Newsboys and Children's
    Aid Society for its work with the city's unusually large population of
    African-American newsboys. In 1888, the year after this volume ends, the
    society paid tuition for 28 newsboys to attend Howard University (pages
    322-3). Newsboys were not just helpless waifs, though, and increasingly
    organized themselves to pursue better arrangements with their suppliers. The
    175-member Washington Newsboys' Union struck in 1883 and won a price cut in
    April 1886 (pages 290 and 294). <br><br>This notebook is unsigned, but was
    apparently kept by Kate Brown Barlow (1837-1913), a widowed woman in the
    District with no children of her own. The Washington Evening Star of 18
    December 1886 features a long first-person report on the Society's work by
    Mrs. K.B. Barlow featuring a few of the same children and anecdotes featured
    in the notebook. She continued in this field through at least 1910, when the
    census described her as "Inspector, Board Children's Guard." Her 6 October
    1913 obituary in the Washington Times described her as "one of the pioneer
    charity workers of the district."

    The Blaine Invincible Republican Club was a political organization which was
    chartered in 1876, and was discussed frequently in the Washington press from
    1884 through their founder and president Perry Carson's death in 1909. They
    remained in existence at least through 1932. The club's namesake was white
    Republican leader James G. Blaine, who served in Congress from 1863 to 1881,
    ran unsuccessfully for president in 1884, and was Secretary of State from
    1889 to 1892. His portrait is mounted at the top of the badge. Several other
    Republican clubs across the country (black and white) assumed the Blaine
    Invincible name, most notably in San Francisco, but the Washington club was
    the only one to continue under that name long after its namesake's influence
    had passed. <br><br>At bottom is an uncaptioned portrait of Perry H.
    "Colonel" Carson (1842-1909), the club's leader for many years, and a major
    force in city politics. He represented the city's Republicans of all races
    at the national conventions from 1880 to 1900. Large in size as well as
    influence and personality, he was known as the "Silver-Haired Giant" or "the
    Tall Black Oak of the Potomac."

    Abraham Hoch Landis (1821-1896) was a physician in several southwestern Ohio
    towns: Germantown in Montgomery County (1845-September 1846), Trenton in
    Butler County (from October 1846), and Millville in Butler County
    (1848-1852); he later settled his family in Logansport, IN. At the heart of
    this collection are approximately 90 letters written to Dr. Landis from a
    wide variety of family and professional correspondents, 1845-1860.
    <br><br>Nephew Jacob B. King wrote on 19 November 1850 from the recently
    established Otterbein University; an 1878 graduation program is also
    included. Several friends write from nearby Miami University in Ohio
    describing campus life. R.T. Drake on 29 October 1846 describes a fire on
    campus at length, and on 17 December describes the ascension of "a balloon
    from the top of the college . . . manufactured from one of the students." He
    describes the selection of William Caldwell Anderson as president on 23 June
    1849. Another Miami student, Joseph K. Zeller, on 13 June 1846 also makes
    apparently sarcastic comments about the Mexican War: "Haven't you
    volunteered yet? Where is your patriotism? Hurrah for the annexation of
    Mexico! Come all ye true patriots to the standard!!" Similarly, relative
    Noah Kumler reported from Dayton, OH on 21 June 1846 on a group of
    volunteers who were rejected: "They appear to be greatly disappointed in not
    having the privilege of marching to Mexico and reveling in the halls of
    Montezuma's." <br><br>On the political front, many letters discuss local
    politics. One is a 2-page printed circular letter from the Whig State
    Central Committee Room in Columbus, OH, 16 September 1846, hoping to bring
    out the vote for the coming state election (no examples in OCLC). Not many
    of the letters discuss the medical profession at length, but brother F.B.
    Landis wrote from Seven Mile, OH on 1 August 1849 to warn that three doctors
    in his town had died in a cholera outbreak. Another physician wrote on 17
    November 1849 from Hamilton, OH: "I send you as requested a vaccinating
    scab. It is from the arm of a healthy child." We are pleased to affirm that
    the scab is no longer present with the letter. Also present are a 4-page
    essay on chemistry by Dr. Landis dated 2 July 1851, and a fragmentary
    prescription book giving names and formulas but no place or date.
    <br><br>This lot includes 35 later family letters plus some additional
    receipts dating from the 1870s through 1890s, addressed to several family
    members. Dr. Landis served as an assistant surgeon in the Civil War with the
    35th Ohio Infantry, suffering wounds at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. In
    1866, he named his sixth child after the battle site. If you are a fan of
    baseball history, you may guess where this is going. . . . The son, Kenesaw
    Mountain Landis (1866-1944), became a judge, and later the long-serving
    first Commissioner of Baseball, presiding over the expulsion of the Black
    Sox scandal, the rise of the "Live Ball Era," night baseball, the All-Star
    Game, and (on the debit side) the last stand of the color line. Spotted
    among the family correspondence are two letters from young Kenesaw, whose
    identity is barely recognizable among the family inside jokes and nicknames.
    While baseball fans might think of him as stern and humorless, the letters
    are tinged with humor and slang, and provide an unusual insight into his
    personality long before his national fame--one as a 17-year-old railroad
    errand boy, and the other as a 32-year-old partner in an upstart law firm.
    <br><br>Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Autograph Letter Signed with his family
    nickname "Squire," to brother Charles Beary "Gussie" Landis, then a senior
    at Wabash College and later a Congressman. 2 pages, 10 x 8 inches, on one
    sheet of letterhead of the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati & St. Louis Railway
    Company, where Kenesaw was employed as an errand boy. Discusses the
    possibility of gathering the family together in Indianapolis: "You made some
    mention in regard to coming to Ind's to go into law. Merely mentioned that
    such a thing may possibly materialize. Now Guss, is there any chance of such
    a move on your part? If you should come we would get Hoff [brother John
    Howard Landis] down here too, and if three of us got here, I think we would
    get the old folks and the girls." Discussing his work: "All the RR boys are
    quaking in their boots. They have to answer 93 questions on the Westinghouse
    Air Brake. . . . I am learning telegraphy, study hard at it. Think I will
    twig it in 4 or 5 months." Indianapolis, IN, 14 March 1883. <br><br>Kenesaw
    Mountain Landis. Autograph Letter Signed with an indecipherable squiggle
    (perhaps his nickname Kennie), to family members "Mertz and Annie." 4 pages
    on 4 sheets of Uhl, Jones & Landis letterhead naming Kenesaw M. Landis as a
    partner, 10¾ x 8¼ inches. He discusses the work of his brother Charles Beary
    "Gus" Landis, then a United States Congressman for Indiana, who had insisted
    on the firing of a corrupt federal printing clerk named Alfred Baker no less
    than three times: "I see by the papers Gus has again been after the half[?]
    of Baker. I am unable to account for his persistence in hounding this
    worthless cuss. I can't see that the loafer is worth following up, and aside
    from that the spectacle is a sad contradiction of the usual and well-known
    inclination of our family to harmony." On his legal work: "My streak of luck
    in defending the street car damage suits has not yet been broken. Yesterday
    evening a jury in Judge Stough's court gave me a verdict in a case where a
    man (a fraud) was suing for $10,000 on account of 3 accidents. We were in
    trial 4 days. The man had three lawyers, just two too many." He adds a note
    about his family which helps establish the date, as his only daughter
    Susanne Landis Phillips was born on 4 January 1898: "The children are both
    fine. The little girl is developing beautifully. She weighs 16 pounds & is
    very bright. Several intelligent & experienced men & women say she resembles
    her father." Writing a week before the first American troops landed in Cuba,
    the war was on his mind: "I am a good deal concerned with the war. I have no
    doubt we will whip the Spaniard but I am somewhat horrid for fear I will
    always regret that I didn't go. I shall not do so, I promise you that, but I
    can't help but feel that a man would be better satisfied with himself if he
    didn't avoid such a responsibility. But I shall not go. I give you my word."

    Second American edition of an oft-reprinted cookbook best known for its

    further would the impropriety be carried were we to introduce into a work
    intended for the American Publick such English, French and Italian methods
    of rendering things indigestible, which are of themselves innocent, or of
    distorting and disguising the most loathsome objects to render them
    sufferable to already vitiated tastes. These evils are attempted to be
    avoided. Good republican dishes and garnishing, proper to fill an every day
    bill of fare, from the condition of the poorest to the richest individual,
    have been principally aimed at." <br><br>Frontier skills are emphasized in
    the recipes, such as how "to pickle one hundred pounds of Beef to keep a
    year." Despite the opening comments, fresh and saltwater seafood are
    represented--cod, sturgeon, shad, and oysters. Other distinctively American
    dishes include Indian pudding, "pumpion pie," Johnny cake, "Federal cake,"
    and "Thanksgiving cake." The "Jackson jumbles" on page 44 were probably a
    nod to the sitting American president. Numerous non-culinary household tips
    are also included, such as "the only sure way to stop the blaze of a
    female's dress when accidentally caught on fire." <br><br>This title was
    originally published in Watertown in 1830. Another edition was also printed
    in Kingston, Ontario in 1831, which is considered the first English-language

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    John Russell (1793-1863) was a Baptist preacher from Vermont who spent most
    of his life in western Illinois. There he became familiar with the Mormon
    settlement at Nauvoo, and in 1853 published "The Mormoness," the first novel
    featuring the Mormons. This letter predates the origin of the Nauvoo
    settlement, but sheds interesting light on pioneer printing history.
    <br><br>Russell was writing to his old friend Charles Kendall Smith
    (1810-1900) who was interested in coming west from Vermont as a printer.
    Russell quoted the verdict of Cincinnati publisher Eli Taylor: "If he will
    come on here . . . he will have more work than he can do. I will give him a
    thousand dollars worth a year. A power press in a well-conducted office
    would be overrun with business." Russell adds that his friend need only to
    bring a press to Cincinnati: "There is a type foundry in that place. . . .
    There is an opening for you in Cincinnati such as you may never find again.
    . . . The book business of the West is carried on there. It is a moral and
    religious town, and is not like St. Louis and some other western cities
    swimming with gamblers and blacklegs." His friend had contemplated starting
    a small-town newspaper with Russell: "I have no doubt that you would succeed
    here, but it would be folly to suppose that any part of Illinois would in
    fifty years to come afford you that business that Cincinnati will now."
    <br><br>Russell's friend apparently preferred the more bucolic path: Byrd's
    Illinois Imprints shows that C.K. Smith was the printer of the weekly
    Backwoodsman in Grafton, IL near Bluffdale from 1837 to 1839 (entry 346),
    and was later the printer of several books in Monmouth, IL from 1847
    onward.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The great political debate of 1854 was over the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the
    potential admission of two new slave-owning states into the Union. This
    threat galvanized the abolitionists into action and helped to spark the
    Civil War. This broadside advertises a protest meeting in the "Military
    Tract" of western Illinois, so called because the land had originally been
    given out to War of 1812 veterans. The two featured speakers were prominent
    abolitionist lecturers and "champions of freedom." Joshua Reed Giddings
    (1795-1864) was a United States Congressman from Ohio, and Ichabod Codding
    (1810-1866) was a Congregational minister: "Let all the people, far and
    near, come and make this a great day for Freedom.”<br><br>Ex-Congressman
    Abraham Lincoln did not speak at this event, but raised his political
    profile at similar Anti-Nebraska meetings across the state--just ten days
    earlier he had notably faced off against the bill's mastermind Stephen
    Douglas in Peoria on 16 October, in a prelude to the Lincoln–Douglas debates
    of 1858. <br><br>2 copies in OCLC (Yale and Lincoln Presidential Library),

    This is the memoir of Nicholas Pritzker (1871-1956), a Jewish immigrant from
    the Ukraine who became a prominent lawyer in Chicago. His descendants became
    wildly successful and are frequently listed as one of the wealthiest
    families in America, founding the Hyatt hotel chain, the Pritzker
    Architecture Prize, the Pritzker School of Medicine at the University of
    Chicago, and the Pritzker Military Museum & Library. Great-grandson J.B.
    Pritzker is the sitting governor of Illinois. On the Pritzker Group's
    website, the governor is asked "What is your favorite book? Why?" and he
    replies “Three Score After Ten by Nicholas Pritzker. It tells the story of
    an immigrant family’s escape from oppression and of the author’s struggles
    and success in America. It’s in many ways the story of an entrepreneur,
    beaten down at times but never lacking in optimism and willing to fight on
    to attain the American Dream.” The memoir is not in print, or accessible on
    line. <br><br>One of the stranger phrases in bookselling is "excessively
    rare." Usually rarer means better. This one might be excessively rare,
    though. It is so scarce we have no real concept of its potential value, and
    can trace little of its printing history. OCLC lists just one copy in 320
    leaves, bound at a Brooklyn bindery, at the family-founded Pritzker Military
    Library. The Chicago History Museum holds a 2001 archival reproduction of a
    205-page edition "to replace the irreparably deteriorated original." The
    present copy does not look like it dates from 1941, nor does it appear to be
    in any danger of deterioration--the paper stock is crisp and of an obviously
    high quality, with minimal wear. A colophon leaf explains that it was
    typeset by Moorgate Typesetting of Parkrite Street, London SE5 7TR and
    printed by Dramrite Printers Ltd. of 91 Long Lane, Southwark, London SE1
    4PH. The postal codes date the printing no earlier than the early 1970s.
    Other books produced by Moorgate and Dramrite at these addresses date from
    the early 1970s. This appears to be a later printing. However, we find no
    examples of any printing on ABE books or in the auction history. It appears
    to be scarce in any edition--perhaps excessively so.

    New Harmony at the southwestern tip of Indiana was the site of two ambitious
    but doomed utopian experiments, the Harmonists and Owenites, from 1814 to
    1827. It then evolved into a more traditionally governed hotbed of
    intellectual ferment and reform. This circular attempts to launch a new
    institution of higher learning at New Harmony. It is addressed to the former
    readers of the Free Enquirer, a radical New York newspaper with roots in New
    Harmony which published its last issue in June 1835. <br><br>The main body
    of the circular was written 20 August 1835 by the Free Enquirer's co-editor
    Robert Dale Owen (1801-1877), a future Congressman, and son of the Owenite
    community's founder Robert Owen. He describes his goals for a liberal
    non-denominational institution where "literature and science and
    accomplishment" should not "exclude manual labor. Each pupil should learn a
    trade, or occupy himself, during a portion of the day, in the farm or
    garden." <br><br>The benefits of New Harmony as the site of such a school
    (low cost of living, healthful climate, and vibrant intellectual community)
    are expounded upon at length, as well as the proposed curriculum and
    facilities. Owen's appeal is followed by the minutes of the school's board
    of trustees through 3 October 1835. On the final two pages are a detailed
    plan of the section of New Harmony where the proposed school would be
    located; and the floor plan for brother David Dale Owen's proposed classroom
    and laboratory. Although the planning was quite advanced, the school never
    opened. 4 in OCLC; none others traced at auction. <br><br>WITH--a somewhat

    This broadside references "Blanchard's School-House" in Civil Bend, Iowa as

    in this ephemeral river-bottom village in 1849. He built a schoolhouse and
    encouraged some local Black children to attend. Hostile arsonists torched
    the school in 1850, but it was rebuilt in 1851. Blanchard's home, being on
    the banks of the Missouri River across from Nebraska, was a heavily
    frequented stop on the Underground Railroad. The famed John Brown brought a
    "cargo" of escapees there once in February 1859. <br><br>In this broadside,
    one Harrison Spurlock of Civil Bend advertises the availability of "137
    Cords of Dry Elm Wood" available at "Lott Hammond's, one mile northwest of
    Blanchard's School-House." The author was likely William Henry Harrison
    Spurlock (1836-1911), and his associate was Lott Hammond (1815-1870); both
    lived in the Civil Bend area at the time of the 1860 census. Civil Bend, in
    Fremont County at Iowa's far southwestern corner, was never a large
    settlement and is now considered a ghost town.

    William Marshall Swayne (1828-1918) was a sculptor from Chester County, PA
    who sculpted Lincoln and many other notables from life. As recounted in this
    remarkable collection of Swayne's notes and reminiscences, Lincoln
    recognized Swayne at a reception months after the bust was completed, and
    said "You're the gentleman that made a mud bust of me. . . . I like yours
    best." Includes: <br><br>Partial manuscript extracts from Swayne's letters
    to his wife, 1859-1867. Pages 4-52 and 56, 12¼ x 8 inches; bound in upper
    corner with brass fastener, minor wear. Discusses in detail his personal
    sittings with Lincoln on 3 February, 27 March, 25 May, and 2 June 1864, with
    additional discussion of the casting and shipping, and an additional account
    of meeting Lincoln at a reception on 12 January 1865. Also discusses
    sculpting busts of James Buchanan, Simon Cameron, William Seward ("as
    fidgety as a hen on a hot griddle for several days"), Salmon Chase (who was
    entertaining his friend and sponsor Jay Cooke), Andrew Johnson, and many
    more, with long anecdotes about most of them. Also includes a long account

    Ann Walker Curtis (1821-1893) was a lifelong resident of the Kennebunk,
    Maine area. During the period of this diary, she lived with her widowed
    mother Susan Walker Curtis (1794-1877) and sister Alice. One of Walker's
    strengths as a diarist was a curiosity about history. When she met someone
    with an important story to tell, she recorded it with care and apparent
    accuracy. Our favorite is entered in the diary on 23 February 1886, when she
    met a Daniel Morse, aged about 70, who had lived moved of his life in
    Springfield, Ill., where he was "intimately acquainted" with Lincoln, before
    recently returning to Alfred, ME: "Just before the inauguration a gentleman
    called at his place of business . . . told him that he belonged in Baltimore
    and of a conspiracy there to prevent Lincoln from going to Washington &c;
    that he himself had joined the conspirators in order to find out their
    plans, and had come to Springfield to prevent their being carried out. . . .
    Mr. Morse went with him to Lincoln, whom they found . . . in a private room
    at the state house, and he revealed to him all the plans of that plot, now a
    matter of history." On the day Lincoln left for Washington in 1861, he
    visited Morse "to pay him a trifle which he owed him, ten cents. . . . I
    told him, said Mr. Morse, 'Uncle Abe, that is no matter. I haven't put it
    down' 'I have paid every other bill,' said Lincoln, 'and this is the last
    cent I owe,' and, added Mr. Morse, 'I have that dime now.'" Tucked in the
    back of the diary is an 1854 dime, with a note: "Dime A. Lincoln used to pay
    last bill in Springfield, Ill. before he left for Washington, sent to me by
    Mr. Daniel Morse." <br><br>Some of these details check out. Daniel Morse
    (1819-1898) was born in Maine and shows up in Springfield in the 1870 census
    and 1860-1872 city directories as a butcher; he was buried in Alfred, ME. He
    is mentioned briefly in the Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, serving with
    Lincoln on a Springfield Republican nominating committee in 1859. The
    "Baltimore Plot" to assassinate Lincoln on his way east was investigated and
    guarded against by the Pinkerton Detective Agency. We can't find any record
    of Pinkerton sending an agent to Springfield to inform Lincoln, so this is
    either new information or spurious information. The dime--it certainly
    sounds plausible, although there is no way to prove the dime taped in the
    back of this volume is the same one given by Lincoln to Morse.<br><br>On 20
    January 1871, Curtis recorded a neighbor's family story about the Battle of
    Lexington: "Took tea at Jos. Dane's. Old Mrs. Dane was there, and we talked
    of the old times. She said her grandfather Clark was the minister of
    Lexington, and his parsonage close to the battle ground. During the battle
    her grandmother took her little children and hid with them in the woods
    behind the parsonage. The house was ransacked by the 'regulars' and all
    eatables taken, but not injured except where a cannon ball had broken in and
    lodged among the timbers. John Hancock was a relative of Mrs. D.'s
    grandmother and spent the evening there the night before the battle." This
    story stands up under review. The Rev. Jonas Clarke (1730-1805) of Lexington
    was indeed married to a cousin of John Hancock, who stayed at his home
    around the time of the battle. Rev. Clark did have a granddaughter, Mary
    Clark Dane (1790-1872) of Kennebunk, with a son named Joseph Dane
    (1823-1884). <br><br>Perhaps even more impressive, she records some oral
    history on the Boston Tea Party on 14 June 1879. Her Uncle Andrew recounted
    knowing as a youth an old man named Jotham Mitchell: "The old man was a
    Tory, and told of being in Boston when the tea was thrown overboard, and
    with others taking a skiff and trying to save some, and the stout
    tax-resisters preventing and almost drowning them for attempting to do so.
    The son, ashamed, would try to hush his father when he got on that story,
    but it was all in vain. In his eyes, it was too bad to lose so much tea."
    Jotham Mitchell (1746-1840) was born and died in Kennebunk; Andrew Walker
    repeated this story with slight variation in a letter published in the 1892
    Proceedings of the Bostonian Society, page 29. In short, we can establish
    that our diarist was a reliable narrator. <br><br>Historical anecdotes
    aside, this diary is still an interesting slice of local history. Curtis was
    well connected in her community. Early in the diary, she records the final
    meeting of a local society to aid freed slaves: "The Freedmen's Meeting at
    Mr. E.E. Bourne's. Only 9 were there, and we concluded it would now be best
    to close our meetings, which as Soldiers and Freedmens' meetings we have
    kept up for seven years. We packed a bbl with articles made and unmade, and
    shall expend the little money we have on hand in useful articles and add to
    them" (19 May 1868). An amateur artist, she meets several times with the
    noted artist Hannah Brown Skeele (1829-1901) (see 24-25 July 1870). A long
    account of a White Mountains excursion appears on 20 January 1871, and on 6
    July 1876 she offers a long account of the town's most senior residents.

    William Kilby (1763-1829) was a blacksmith in Dennysville, ME, a few miles
    from the coastal border with Canada--about as far east as Down East gets.
    The village was settled in 1786 by a group of 16 settlers from Hingham, MA;
    Kilby came up from Hingham to open his blacksmith shop the following year.
    He eventually held many official posts in the small town, including clerk,
    selectman, treasurer, and postmaster. <br>Lumber was the town's main
    industry, and Kilby often made or repaired supplies for the town's sawmill
    such as crowbars, chains, spikes, hooks, and more. He supplied picks and
    nails for a carding mill (page 207) which seemed to be a much smaller
    operation. For local farmers he supplied hoes, horse shoes, and plows. For
    the schoolhouse (page 95) he produced andirons, a fire shovel, and "an iron
    to ring bell." The town's early leader Judge Theodore Lincoln (1763-1852),
    son of the Revolutionary War general Benjamin Lincoln, is featured on at

    This intrepid merchant packed a lifetime's worth of adventure onto these 7
    months and 29 pages. He was apparently experienced at sea, well versed in
    nautical language. He was not a ship's hand, though. He and his partner Le
    Gros were apparently supercargoes representing the ship's owners as traders.
    And the trading was apparently not quite legitimate, as they sailed on a
    ship of scoundrels against the backdrop of Jefferson's embargo and the
    looming war with the United Kingdom. <br><br>The journal begins with our
    narrator shipping out from Philadelphia, and getting involved in an
    elaborate hunt for one more crew member. One man having fallen ill in
    Philadelphia, they failed to find a replacement in New Castle, DE, and went
    across the river to New Jersey, where a 52-mile carriage ride through the
    country landed one David Walling of Greenwich NJ, who after arriving on ship
    had second thoughts, "stating that his family affairs would not let him!" An
    advance of two doubloons helped settle his misgivings. They were hit by
    several gales before they had cleared Cape May, and then "an anchor gunboat
    No. 16 or a 'Tommy Jefferson' boarded us and said, he believed we might
    proceed." <br><br>The ship's unnamed captain is presented as a surly
    incompetent, with navigation being a particular weakness; he blames a faulty
    calibration of the compass on page 11. The crew often sighted land and then
    needed to ask passing ships where they were. The lack of a spyglass on the
    ship is also noted on page 9. Treacherous shoals were narrowly averted. As
    they fumbled up the New England coast, the captain "concluded our chart must
    be bad, or that the currents were so variable it was impossible to calculate
    for them" (page 12). The narrator and his friend Le Gros sometimes stayed up
    an extra watch at night to be sure the ship would not be dashed to
    pieces.<br><br>The ship's first stop was, improbably, at the mouth of the
    remote Pleasant River in Maine, not far from the Canadian border. This is
    not described as a smuggling operation, but given the extreme secrecy,
    remote location, strict embargo regulations then in effect, and absence of
    customs officials, it certainly sounds like one. Our narrator and the
    captain "saw the father of the person we were in quest of having returned on
    board our vessel." Our narrator was sent on a rowboat 6 miles up river, and
    then "footing it first up and then down hill, now on all fours, and now up
    to my knees in mud, and now breaking my shins against the stones in the
    road." In rural Columbia, Maine he arranged the business and returned to his
    ship, which was anchored amid the rocks: "We were afterwards informed it was
    a great wonder we had not been dashed to pieces, having gone between many
    little islands where vessels never were before." The ship unloaded ballast
    and took on barrels of cargo. <br><br>The loading of the vessel was
    interrupted by an old local man "giving us his pedigree . . . and asking
    many foolish questions." If there's one thing smugglers don't like, it's
    interlopers asking foolish questions. They devised a clever way to be rid of
    the nuisance: "One of the hands below dressed himself up with blankets as
    though sick. When coming on deck we directed our attention to him, asking
    the old man how they cured the smallpox in this part of the country. Small
    pox! The name so startled him that he jumped into his boat with more
    activity than I believe he ever possessed before." They loaded their barrels
    of cargo mostly by night in this desolate cove, with their local contact
    warning them about a dispatch boat which patrolled the coast. The promised
    warning shots failed to alert them when the dispatch boat made its
    appearance. "In close chase of us, we spread all our canvass with a fine
    breeze and soon left her behind . . . she soon turned about and bore up for
    two other vessels." Free of his late-night watches, his muddy slog to
    Columbia, and the successful escape from the authorities, our narrator then
    had "an opportunity for rest, I not having had sleep for three days and
    nights." This takes us through 31 August. <br><br>The ship then bore south
    toward the Caribbean with its mysterious cargo. The ship was inadequately
    provisioned, "without any liquor on board, our sugar and small stores
    lasting about half the passage when we substituted for coffee burnt biscuit
    boiled in water, having nothing but flour, biscuit and beef . . . we caught
    a barrel of rain water once in a heavy shower." The captain grew more surly
    and erratic: "When I went on deck I found him stretched his full length
    under the tiller with a rest provided by way of a pillow. I took the helm
    and remained at it 30 minutes before he awoke, when a quarrel immediately
    ensued in which he abused me much, [and] challenged Mr. Le Gros on the main
    deck to fight him." The captain shared a story from his time in charge of a
    legitimate mercantile voyage aboard the schooner Ann Pennock, in which he
    had broken open the barrels of flour, skimmed a small portion from each, and
    making himself up three new barrels of flour which he was able to sell on
    his own account. He proposed doing the same with his present cargo.
    <br><br>The ship arrived on the coast of Suriname (then a British colony) on
    14 October to discharge their cargo, but "there being no chart on board
    which laid down the coast on soundings, the capt could not tell where we
    were, but one moment would say we were far to leeward of our port, and next
    a great way to windward." The captain led them into a (wrong) port, running
    onto shoals in sight of a British fort. The fort's commandant offered
    cursory aid, but lacked the boats to make a full rescue and also noted that
    the ship was likely to be marauded by a nearby French fort. The ship was
    miraculously able to detach from the rocks at high tide, and made its way to
    Bram's Point [Braamspunt], opposite the city of Paramaribo. "Here we lay all
    night, the crew keeping watch as it was feared our cables might break, but
    when it came to the captain's turn he laid down on the hen coop and went
    fast to sleep, leaving the vessel to the mercy of the waves." Here the
    narrator secured permission to trade from the colonial governor, and set
    about selling his cargo. He found that the crew was selling barrels off the
    ship behind his back, and when confronted, all including the captain
    threatened to quit. At this point, the first mate Rogers had harsh words
    with the narrator's friend Le Gros, and "threatened the owners and myself
    very hard, and I believe very little would have induced him and his
    companions to have risen on us, one of them having at all times a pistol,
    the only fire-arm on board." Our narrator was in charge of the ship's
    ownership papers, which the captain began asking to take possession of: "We
    were so much alarmed that we could not go to sleep both at a time."
    <br><br>The ship passed Tobago, Grenada, and Haiti. At the eastern tip of
    Jamaica they were boarded by the HMS Haddock, whose commander demanded to
    see the supercargo and his papers. Our nervous narrator went aboard and was
    told his papers were "all my eye Betty Martin." That is old English slang
    for "complete nonsense." The commander, who "in his dress resembled a
    Frenchman with a monkey roundabout," subjected him to "a great deal of
    cross-questioning and insolent language, telling me if I was worth it, he
    would send me in a prize." They impressed one sailor, "for whom I begged
    very hard, but to no purpose, and indeed twas with difficulty I got the
    other though he had a protection [certificate], the poor fellow being so
    frightened, could say nothing clear." The ship proceeded on to Kingston,
    Jamaica "in distress with 3 feet of water in our hold." At that point our
    narrator and Le Gros parted ways from the ship and booked their passage home
    on a British ship. They arrived in New York on 16 December and arrived in
    Philadelphia by stage four days later, "highly gratified at finding my
    relations and friends all well." <br><br>The last 4 pages of the narrative
    are devoted to a separate voyage: "After being here a few days it was
    concluded I should again go to sea, and on the 2nd Jan'y 1809 went on board
    the Ann Pennock cleared for Charleston." That was the same ship which his
    insane ex-captain had once defrauded, if you are paying close attention.
    This ship made it as far as Savannah, where they broke up upon the breakers
    trying to enter the harbor: "It was concluded the capt, his wife, and myself
    with 2 hands should make our escape and send the boat back for the others.
    We left the vessell with our trunks and in an hour and a half reached the
    shore. . . . We luckily had loaded pistols with us, by which we struck fire
    and so protected ourselves from the night air, we being on a desolate island
    with nothing to eat. . . . Fell in with a negro in a canoe. I went on board
    the canoe and after paddling several miles with him, got out of his canoe
    and footed it till sundown, when we arrived at a plantation, the property of
    Judge Stevens. . . . Next morn I crossed the ferry, at 12 o'clock arrived in
    Savanna, my feet all blisters." The Ann Pennock was towed into port for
    repairs on 17 March. In closing our narrator notes that "it was expected the
    city would be set on fire, many attempts having been made, but all nipped in
    the bud." <br><br>The author of this narrative has not been identified. He
    has provided enough circumstantial clues that an identification may not be
    impossible. On the other hand, he clearly took pains to avoid naming
    himself, his captain, his ship, and his cargo--likely because the entire
    voyage was of dubious legality. Why write the narrative, then? It appears to
    have been reworked and expanded from notes kept aboard the ship, with
    extensive revisions to improve the language and add details. One suspects he
    intended to publish it as a colorful maritime narrative, though we can find
    no hint that it ever made it to press. It's not too late. <D>

  CROSSHEAD: Pair of tavern ledgers from Frederick County.
  at-a-glance: 'Libertytown, MD, 1784-91'
  TYPESET: >-
    [8], 41, [4]; [2], 45, 43, [2] manuscript leaves. 2 volumes. Folio, 16 x 6¼
    inches, original ½ calf, minor wear; moderate dampstaining, occasional
    portions of pages cut out, McSherry's a bit bowed, Coale's lacking front
    free endpaper and leaf 7.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    These two ledgers were kept by brothers-in-law Bernard / Barney McSherry
    (1764-1796) and Richard Coale (1760-1834), both of Libertytown in Frederick
    County, MD. Coale was married to McSherry's sister Catherine; their daughter
    married into the Sappington family (see lots 42, 160 and 229). The ledgers
    are identical in size and binding, cover largely overlapping time periods,
    and have very similar content: selling alcohol by the glass along with
    occasional other merchandise. McSherry's has a handful of cash journal and
    memoranda pages going back to 1784, with most of the ledger accounts running
    from April 1787 to June 1788. He sold grog, wine, hot toddy, cider, rum, and
    at least twice a "ticket to the show" (pages 7 and 12). Among his customers
    was Captain Ely Dorsey, who survived a British prison during the Revolution.
    <br><br>Coale's ledger is more wide-ranging, and divided into two sections.
    His original business was more like a general store which sold occasional
    liquor. In addition to rum, punch and brandy, he also sold textiles, tea,
    and sugar. A name index in the rear covers only the first section. His
    entries begin in November 1786 and the first section extends through October
    1788. The second section is more of a pure tavern ledger, and runs from
    September 1788 to early 1791. In this rear section, liquor sales to
    "Abraham, negro" are recorded on page 7, and another customer is charged for
    "the hire of negro Peter" on page 24. Revolutionary War captains Lilburn
    Williams and William Lamar appear on page 19 and 21. Coale also included
    charges for dinners, suppers, "the Ball," and for a gaming club. For
    example, one man is charged on page 26 for "Club in grogg at ninepins" (an
    early form of bowling) and "Club at Cards." It would appear that perhaps
    Coale took over McSherry's tavern in mid-1788. The two men had accounts with
    each other (page 6 in McSherry's ledger, page 3 in Coale's).

    minor dampstaining.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Francis Brown Sappington (1754-1838) was a physician in Libertytown in
    Frederick County, MD; he apparently mended shoes on the side. The first
    volume contains mostly ledger accounts with patients started mostly from
    1806 to 1809, most of them concluded by 1811, through page 254. Most of the
    patient entries are heavily abbreviated prescriptions, with the occasional
    entry in plain English such as "a visit, night, to wife in labour" (page 2)
    or "went 11 miles, staying all night & delivering woman, consultation with
    Dr. Brashear" (page 92) or "inoculating 7 patients" (page 109). Among his
    patients are "Peggy & Mingo" on page 6. One patient paid his bill in part by
    "hire of Negro Dennis one years £22.10.0" (page 190). The ledger concludes
    with a cash journal dated 1829 to 1837, an odd mix of shoe repair and
    medical prescriptions, pages 255 to 289. It also begins with 3 pages of
    recipes: pickling, curing meat, dyeing cloth, "cement for broken glasses,"
    and even a couple for curing coughs; and an index. <br><br>The second ledger
    includes accounts dated 1814-21 plus an index, with similar entries to the
    first ledger. A long account with his mother Frances on page 16 includes
    inoculations for family members, and also another entry from his
    side-hustle: "to mending shoes for her negroes." <br><br>Included with the
    ledgers are 15 letters and accounts relating to Dr. Sappington's family:
    <br><br>6 letters to his daughter Harriet Sappington (1785-1856) dated
    1798-1804 and undated. Some were received while at boarding school from her
    aunt Lydia Ridgely, who encouraged her studies and discussed "the important
    and instructive History of Rome" at length--most likely Gibbons. Another
    from an unidentified friend on 22 August [1804] discusses the scandalous
    elopement of George Bevans (1782-1814) with Mary Ogle (1785-1844), daughter
    of the former governor of Maryland. Bevans is referred to in other sources
    as an "uncouth Englishman" and this letter offers additional details on
    their unconventional courtship. <br><br>3 letters to Dr. Sappington from his
    mother Frances Brown Sappington (1723-1838), 1798-1811. One reports on
    "taking all the nervous pills I have . . . send me some nervous pills." Her
    1811 letter requests a strong horse and suggests that she was still actively
    managing her farm at age 88. <br><br>Letter from a friend regarding Frances
    Brown Sappington's health, 29 December 1797. <br><br>Two long accounts and
    two letters from nieces relating to the settlement of Frances Brown
    Sappington's estate, 1816. <br><br>Undated letter from daughter-in-law
    Rebecca Boyce Sappington (1755-1794) of Tennessee to Frances Brown
    Sappington: "The children express a great desire to see their grand mamma.
    Roger and Frank often dispute who best remember you." For related papers see

    First edition of all four volumes (second issue of Volume IV with added
    preface). "Ranks above all other colonial historians"--Kraus, Writing of
    American History, page 55. Hutchinson was a Loyalist. When his house was
    attacked during the Stamp Act riots, the manuscript of Volume II was thrown
    into the muddy streets, but was recovered and issued separately in 1767. He
    moved to London with the onset of the Revolution. The Collection is
    described as "a necessary adjunct to Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts
    Bay," and the fourth volume was published posthumously from Hutchinson's
    notes in 1828--Sabin 34069, 34075, 34082. Evans 9705, 10658, 11300; Howes

    I bears extensive inscriptions tracing ownership from the Rev. Noah Hobart
    of Fairfield, CT in 1765, to his stepson Dr. Nathaniel Lothrop; then given
    at Plymouth to John Davis in 1828. Volume II is inscribed on the title page
    "Eben'r Hazard's, Erskine Hazard," suggesting ownership by historian and
    postmaster general Ebenezer Hazard (1744-1819) and his son the industrialist
    Erskine Hazard (1790-1865), though the inscription is in the hand of
    neither. Volume III is inscribed on the title page "S. Dexter's, A. Ward's."
    Volume IV is inscribed "Jno Davis" and has a note bound in, "With the
    editor's best acknowledgments of Judge Davis's exertions in forwarding the
    publication of the acompanying work," Greatham, April 23 1828. Judge John
    Davis (1861-1847), president of the Massachusetts Historical Society, played
    a role in the publication of the 4th volume and is cited in its preface; he
    apparently brought these 4 volumes together. They appear as a group in

    discusses a controversy over abolitionist Isaac Knapp, former co-publisher
    of the Liberator: "We have strange 'Times' here in the city--that paper has
    ben trying to get up a mob for Mr. Knapp, but has not yet succeeded. Mr. K

    brother" who "invited them into his parlor, told them if they would come in
    Mr. Knapp would pray for them all night. They gave the man 3 cheers for his

    Letters by and about the Rev. Charles H.A. Dall, missionary to India,

  TYPESET: >-
    8 letters, mostly addressed to the Rev. Dall's wife Caroline Wells Healey
    Dall; generally minor wear.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The Unitarian missionary Charles Henry Appleton Dall (1816-1886) spent most
    of his career in India, leaving his wife and children at home in Boston. His
    wife Caroline Wells Healey Dall (1822-1912) was a more noteworthy historical
    figure, a pioneer of the women's rights movement and author on a wide
    variety of subjects. Offered here are 3 of his letters home to Caroline--and
    5 related letters from other parties which hint at clouds of controversy
    regarding her absent husband. <br><br>Rev. Dall's first letter is dated 2
    August 1871 from a steamer in the Arabian Sea, as he returned from an
    eventful two-month vacation in Europe. He mentions "John Ruskin's study &
    classroom at Oxford," a visit to the studios of American artists William
    Wetmore Story and Harriet Hosmer in Rome; and visits to Venice and Mount
    Vesuvius. He regrets that his wife has been unable to share these sights,
    and supposes "I am to finish my life in Bengal." A postscript was written
    from port in Calcutta five days later, regarding their son's planned
    expedition to the Aleutian Islands: "I have scrutinized all accessible
    newspapers in vain to find any a/c of our brave Will's expedition &
    departure." A 27 December 1871 letter is written from Calcutta, the date of
    his daughter Sarah Keene Dall's wedding in America. He regrets being unable
    to attend. He adds: "I fear you will think me cold-hearted in telling you
    about Aldrich & the strange errors he is circulating here out of his
    perverted brain & heart. . . . If you decide that I am insane . . . your
    estimate & mine of your duties to your husband in this matter differ very
    widely, and until you clear it up by treating me as sane, must darken the
    sky between us." Dall's final letter is dated from the Nilgiri Hills in S.W.
    India, 8 November 1877. Regarding a financial settlement, he remarks with
    apparent sarcasm: "With 12 or 13 thousand dollars of your own, you will be
    able to show your talents as a manager of money for the first time in your
    life, & to make good your self-praise as a 'business woman.'" He continues
    with an apparently mocking discourse regarding her "insane brother George"
    who had been placed in an asylum in Paris at great expense, and "who so
    longed for gentleness and patience and considerate affection from those who
    God called to love him, but did not." <br><br>With the Rev. Dall's three
    letters are three from Lewis Washburne Aldrich (1843-1874), who went to
    Calcutta in 1869 as Dall's associate missionary and returned in some sort of
    cloud two years later. His long partial letter written to Rev. Dall during
    this period catalogues Dall's harsh treatment of servants and abrasive
    manner. Then on 11 September 1871 Aldrich writes to Mrs. Dall: "I am very
    sorry that I was so weak as to take the course which I did with Mr. Dall. I
    did very wrong and am sorry for it." However, on 28 September he writes "I
    have rec'd this week letters from Calcutta which put matters in a new light.
    I shall . . . put the matter between Mr. D and myself into the hands of the
    public. I have stood all the abuse and misrepresentation that I intend to. .
    . . Back here and in Calcutta everything has been said against me that could
    be invented while I have had no opportunity to meet the charges." A fellow
    Unitarian clergyman, Charles Lowe of Somerville, MA, writes two weeks later
    on 13 October 1871: "I presume your note from Mr. Aldrch may be similar to
    one which I received from him which was so steeped in jealousy and
    suspiciousness . . . that I could only feel pity for him. . . . Mr. Dall has
    unfortunate peculiarities of temperament--that we all know. But there are
    proofs enough of his devotedness & his valuable service in India."
    <br><br>Finally, a short and banal letter from Boston publishers Lee &
    Shepard is addressed to Mrs. Dall, explaining that a particular payment had
    never been received on her behalf. In verso, she has written a note hinting
    that Mr. Dall may have mishandled the $300: "In case this note survives me.
    . . . Never did he give one dollar to my books. Never did I spend a dollar
    of his for them." <br><br>See lot 1 for an Alaskan letter by their son, the

    This club of elite Bostonians was formed to take advantage of equestrian
    opportunities among the Fenway, Boston's new scenic parkway which fully

    organizational and annual meetings, as well as the by-laws. 7 printed annual
    financial statements, 4 printed meeting notices, and two original meeting
    petitions signed by the membership are laid down. Member T. Jefferson
    Coolidge, United States Minister to France, signed both petitions. Minutes
    of the club's more extensive Governors meetings appear at the rear of the
    volume. Approximately 100 membership nomination slips and other membership
    materials are tipped in or laid into this section. John Quincy Adams II
    (1833-1894) and Thomas Bailey Aldrich also appear on the membership rolls. A
    small number of women were elected to membership. The 28 October 1896
    minutes discuss the case of Miss Martha Parsons, who had gained access to
    the club through her brother's membership at a "time when membership by
    ladies was expected to be rare and not viewed favorably"; she was granted

    The author of this series, Dr. Edward Bliss Foote (1829-1906) was a
    physician, birth control and public hygiene advocate, and civil rights
    advocate. This very unusual series introduces children to medicine and
    anatomy via a young Black man and his pet, a "troublesome monkey." Foote
    covers some difficult territory in Volume 5, which bears a preface that some
    may find it "unsuitable to children." The female and male reproduction
    systems are shown in graphic (but not very erotic) cutaways on pages 180½
    and 180¾ ("this leaf can be cut out if thought advisable"). <br><br>Yet more
    controversially, Sammy is described as escorting young Miss Julia Barkenstir
    to her home, where he gave her a not very platonic kiss goodnight in the
    doorway--shown here in a half-page engraving on page 203. It is believed to
    be the first interracial kiss depicted in the United States. The
    "Publishers' Announcement" on pages 228-230 of Volume 1 reveals that the
    numerous illustrations throughout the volumes are mostly from original
    pen-and-ink sketches by prominent illustrator Henry Louis Stephens. Blockson

    and other papers as described.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Josiah Simpson (1815-1874) served as the assistant surgeon of the 6th United
    States Infantry under Winfield Scott. In this letter to his brother, then an
    officer in the Topographical Engineers, he describes the army's recent
    triumphs from Vera Cruz to Mexico City. He describes the fatal wound
    suffered by his fellow assistant surgeon and bunkmate William Roberts at
    Molino del Rey: "Poor Roberts left my room (where he had been sleeping) a
    short time before daylight to join his regiment, the 5th Inf'y, in the
    attack on the foundery, and was brought back to the same place about ten
    o'clock with a wound directly over the left eye, the ball having entered his
    scull and passed out at the left temple. He lived in this condition for
    better than a month, and finally died from inflammation of the brain. A
    better fellow never lived. When he was shot he was rallying one of the
    companies of the 5th Inf'y which (in consequence of its officer Lieut.
    Strong having been killed) had gotten into disorder." <br><br>The capture of
    Chapultepec Castle is described, as well as a clever manoeuver at the gates
    of Mexico City to capture its battery: "From the place where the troops were
    halted up to the battery at the gate, the road on either side was well built
    up with houses. Genl. Worth directed part of his command to work their way
    up to the battery through the houses by means of pick axes and crowbars. The
    houses having been all deserted, the enemy had no means of knowing what was
    going on. . . . Our troops, having worked their way through the houses until
    they had gotten on the flank of the enemies battery suddenly made their
    appearance and poured into the cannoniers a most deadly fire of musketry."
    Dr. Simpson also offers a critique of the early peace negotiations,
    expressing frustration that President Polk had sent little-known Nicholas
    Trist instead of a leading statesman as negotiator: "Genl. Scott I have no
    doubt would have been as able a negotiator as he could have selected, but I
    suppose Mr. Polk was afraid of him." <br><br>

    The letter's first pages including the dateline are missing, but it
    describes the recent fall of Mexico City on 15 September, and discusses a
    second treaty negotiation to be held on the 30th, placing it firmly in
    Mexico City, late September 1847. Although incomplete, it is one of most
    gripping Mexican War letters we have seen. <br><br>Also included is
    Simpson's manuscript diary in a bilingual "Leroux's English Almanac for
    1848" printed in Mexico, with front matter and date headings in Spanish and
    English. 12mo, publisher's cloth, minor wear; lacking rear free endpaper;
    with his dated signature on front pastedown. It includes sporadic entries
    dated 7 January to 19 December 1848. Compared with his long letter packed
    with narrative detail, the entries are short and utilitarian, such as:
    "Commenced receiving beef from Senor Pizarro for hosp'l at 8 cts per pound"
    (6 February). Entries from 12 to 19 April trace his route from Mexico City
    to Xalapa. On 3 June he noted "Left Jalapa in company with five other med.
    officers in charge of about 500 sick en route for New Orleans," reaching
    their destination ten days later. From there he proceeded to Governor's
    Island, NY on 23 July, and then to his home in Lambertville, NJ.

    The ferry is promoted as the most attractive crossing point on the Missouri

    routes from Boonville to 20 other destinations, ranging as far as Dallas,
    TX. The text at bottom vouches for the accuracy of the tables, perhaps
    protesting too much: "While the emigrant may be told differently, it will be
    by parties that are irresponsible." It also explains why other river
    crossings can only lead to misery and woe, including a washed-out road along
    the river southeast of Boonville, and the fine state of the road from
    Rocheport to Booneville along the north shore: "Don't be persuaded that the
    road is bad from Rocheport. . . . Should anyone tell you so, he will be
    telling a falsehood and ought not to be believed" as the road offers "good
    camping grounds and plenty of water for man or beast." Illustrated with a

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    William Hibben Hivling (1842-1862) began this diary upon leaving home from
    Xenia, OH to attend the Naval Academy. He changed trains at Harpers Ferry
    ("one of the most romantic looking places I ever was in") just a year before
    John Brown's raid, and arrived at the academy to be admitted as an Acting
    Midshipman on 20 September. On 27 December he and 40 of his classmates went
    to Washington and dropped in on the Secretary of the Navy and President
    Buchanan. A horrific incident occurred on 4 April 1859: "On account of one
    of the fellows telling tales on his classmates, in the evening a lot of them
    (nobody knows who they were) got a hold of him and tarred and feathered him,
    and then made him resign." He notes "playing ball" on 16 April 1859.
    <br><br>On 23 June 1859, he shipped out on the USS Plymouth, which had
    previously served in Perry's "Black Fleet" in Japan, but was now serving as
    a training vessel. Hivling left off his diary, and kept a proper log of the
    voyage, resuming the diary upon their arrival in Cadiz, Spain on 8 August
    (interspersed with short accounts of shore leave in Plymouth and Brest). On
    19 August he gives a good description of a visit to Funchal in the Madeira
    Islands, and sampled porpoise meat on 22 August ("it went elegant, it tasted
    like beef-stake, if I could get such meat to eat I would never grumble at
    ship's fare"). The ship arrived back at Annapolis on 27 September, in time
    to write: "considerable excitement was raised hear on account of the Harpers
    Ferry Riot" (18 October) and commemorate "the memoriable day on which Old
    John Brown is to be hung" (2 December). Six days after the hanging,
    "everybody talking about Old John Brown and disunion." <br><br>Pinned to the
    flyleaf is a page of instructions to Hivling, urging him to keep a journal
    and advising to start on page 21 so he can add in his earlier life later on.
    5 of Hivling's classmates have inscribed another worn preliminary leaf.
    <br><br>Hivling later died at sea during the Civil War, but he outlived the
    USS Plymouth--it was scuttled at the outset of the war to avoid falling into
    rebel hands.

    The USS Constitution was one of the six original frigates in the United
    States Navy when it was built in 1797. It served in the War of 1812 and
    remains docked in Boston today as a museum. Here it is shown in dry dock at
    the Philadelphia Navy Yard. The copper sheathing which gave the ship its
    nickname Old Ironsides can be seen on its lower half, with the upper half
    stripped down to its vertical planking. This photograph was the basis of an
    engraving in the Harper's Weekly supplement of 10 July 1875, page 569.

    The new 1846 constitution created the New York Court of Appeals, and granted
    the state's voters the right to select its Attorney General and Secretary of
    State. This artfully arranged album was compiled by delegate Conrad
    Swackhamer of Brooklyn, a 31-year-old mechanic and one of the few artisans
    among the lawyers and gentleman farmers at the convention. His calligraphic
    title page reads "Autographs of the Members of the State Convention to
    Revise the Constitution of the State of New York, 1846." The autographs are
    semi-alphabetical, with most protected by original tissue guards. The first
    18 leaves are delegates, followed by a second title page, 3 leaves of
    officers and staff, and 2 leaves of newspaper reporters. The most notable
    signer is delegate Samuel J. Tilden (1814-1886), then a young New York City
    lawyer and much later the winner of the popular vote in the 1876
    presidential election. Also spotted are former New York City mayor Robert
    Hunter Morris (1808-1855); and armament producer Gouverneur Kemble

    Early manuscript record book of the Ancient Lutheran Trinity Church in

  TYPESET: >-
    40, [16, 2] manuscript leaves, in Dutch, English, and German, plus many
    blank leaves. Folio (12½ x 7¾ inches), original vellum-covered boards,
    rebacked in vellum at an early date, moderate wear; later pencil doodles on
    leaf 72, minor wear to contents.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This congregation was founded by Dutch Lutherans in Manhattan in 1643, and
    was officially chartered in 1664 after the English took control of the
    island. They were later known as Trinity Church. Their increasing number of
    German-speaking members broke off to form Christ Church Lutheran in 1750,
    reflecting a transition in the church's membership from its Dutch origins to
    an increasing number of German members, as the descendants of the founders
    assimilated into late-colonial society. The two groups reunited in 1784.
    They remain active today as the Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. Matthew,
    considered the oldest extant Lutheran congregation in America. <br><br>The
    earliest entries in this volume are in Dutch, consist of fairly sporadic
    financial memoranda, and date from 1705 to 1754, covering leaves 1-12 and
    181-194. Of particular interest is a long memorandum on church articles
    bought in Hamburg including books and a silver chalice (page 6). <br><br>The
    remaining records resume from 1767 to 1784, and consist mostly of
    semi-regular financial reports on leaves 13 to 40 summarizing moneys
    received (alms, rent, collections) and cash disbursements (minister's
    salary, building maintenance, charitable works, "bread & wine for ye Lord's
    Supper"). On leaf 21 is a meeting report discussing the removal of a chimney
    and other work done on the parsonage house in 1772. In November 1783, the
    church paid 18 shillings "to the Negro for schlaipin the church,"
    German-born tinsmith John Balthus Dash appears frequently from 1769 onward
    as bringing in cash receipts or handling disbursements, although he is not
    named as a treasurer. The records in this period are mostly in English,
    often with curious spellings reflecting a German background, such as "graff"
    for grave on leaf 31. However, the pastors named in this section, Weygand
    and Houseal, were from the portion of the congregation which remained as the
    "Ancient Lutheran Trinity Church" rather than the breakaway German group. As
    a reminder that Manhattan was under military occupation from 1776 to 1783,
    the February 1780 report shows that the church received 8 shillings from the
    "Hessian Artillery" (verso of leaf 32). Near the rear of the volume is a
    4-page essay regarding the church, written in German by John Balthus Dash on
    18 April 1770. The last two pages of the record book list fees charged for
    several burials from 1774 to 1778: "Jacob Housser child," "Tobias Heim son,"
    "Mr. Wheten wife," etc., along with a list of standard rates charged.
    <br><br>Provenance: John Balthus Dash (1727-1804), who made entries in the
    volume from 1770 to 1784; great-grandson Balthus Dash (1834-1894), who
    loaned the book for an unknown exhibit per an inscription on his calling
    card (laid in); in the Dash family until sold to the consignor in 1983.

    Fathers, Richard Varick.
  at-a-glance: 'New York, 1763-74, 1799-1816'
  TYPESET: >-
    First volume: [6], 61, [2] manuscript pages. Folio, 12½ x 7½ inches,
    original stiff paper wrappers bearing an inked armorial stamp, lacking much
    of front wrapper; intermittent dampstaining, a few pages detached or partly
    torn out, numerous documents tipped or laid in.<br><br>Second volume: [2],
    53, [10] manuscript pages. Folio, 12¾ x 8 inches, original marbled wrappers,
    moderate wear; minimal foxing and wear to contents; several documents pinned
    or laid in.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Richard Varick (1753-1831) was a New York lawyer who served as a colonel and
    aide under generals Schuyler, Arnold and Washington during the Revolution,
    helped preserve Washington's wartime correspondence, and served as the
    second post-war mayor of New York from 1789 to 1801. Offered here are two
    account books from his legal career, both shedding light on his professional
    connections with his fellow Federalist political allies, and particularly
    with his mentor and law partner John Morin Scott (1730-1784). <br><br>The
    earlier volume tracks motions and fees for dozens of legal cases from 1763
    through 1774, apparently for the prominent New York lawyer and patriot John
    Morin Scott. Scott's name scarcely appears in the journal, although two
    inserted receipts from 1769 both detail "register costs from complainants,
    Scott P compt." Scott is a plaintiff in a case on page 27, and a rare
    first-person entry on this page reads "I p'd the monies on this decree." On
    page 48, Scott again appears as plaintiff, this time against future
    Continental Congress member-turner-Loyalist Isaac Low. A power of attorney
    given to Scott is affixed to page 56.<br><br>The volume is kept in several
    different hands, apparently by various law clerks who worked for Scott; the
    bulk of the entries are unsigned. While a student at King's College from
    1771 to 1774, Richard Varick served as a clerk for Scott, and then after
    passing the bar became a partner in Scott's firm. Signatures by Varick as
    "R. Varick" appear on pages 49, 51 (thrice), and 52, in addition to dozens
    of notes signed as "R.V." from 1772 to 1774. They document Varick's first
    employment in the legal field, a humble beginning to a long and
    distinguished career as one of New York's founding fathers. <br><br>This
    early account book also names several other important New Yorkers. James
    Duane, later Varick's predecessor as the first mayor of New York under
    independence, is mentioned several times in his role as clerk of the
    Chancery Court. The longest and most complex case in the volume is Lewis
    Morris vs. Peter Van Brugh Livingston, with many dozens of lawyer's filings
    recorded over most of two pages, 1763-1770 (pages 4-5). Both were prominent
    patriots, and Morris would sign the Declaration of Independence. Prominent
    merchants in New York's Jewish community feature in the case of Solomon
    Simpson vs. Isaac Levy and Moses Franks on page 60. <br><br>The second
    volume covers a much later period, but is also related. Varick's legal
    mentor John Morin Scott died in 1784. His widow Helena Rutgers Scott Myers
    (1732-1798) was left in possession of extensive land holdings in the
    Kayaderossera Patent in and near Saratoga County in upstate New York. She
    sold off the land in many smaller tracts, usually on credit. She remarried
    and outlived both of her children, leaving a granddaughter Elizabeth
    Litchfield Ross (1775-1799) as her executor--but this granddaughter died a
    few months later. At this point, Richard Varick stepped in to serve as
    administrator of his late law partner's widow's estate, which was large and
    complex. This account book, which seems to be largely in Varick's hand,
    tracks the disposition of dozens of assets, each described briefly and keyed
    to an inventory (not present). The assets include bonds going back to 1785,
    mortgages, and especially unpaid debts on land sales from the Kayaderossera
    Patent. Varick carefully recorded the money due payments received on each
    one, often devoting a page or more in red and black ink to a single
    transaction, and signing at the bottom when that asset was retired. It was
    complex and painstaking work, perhaps somewhat routine for a lawyer. Varick
    was not a working lawyer at that point, nor was he a retired man of leisure;
    he was the sitting mayor of New York when this work began. He was voted out
    of office in 1801 in a wave of anti-Federalist sentiment, and continued
    serving as administrator of the Scott-Myers estate through its final
    settlement in 1816. <br><br>Among the notable figures in this second account
    book are James Gordon (1739-1810) and Beriah Palmer (1740-1812), two United
    States Representatives from the Saratoga area who had served as Helena
    Scott's agents for many of her land sales in the 1790s; and New York State
    Senator Abraham Van Vechten (1762-1837), who apparently served as Varick's
    collection agent upstate. Varick's proper signature appears at the bottom of
    29 pages; he writes his own name in the body of the accounts in countless
    other places.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Hugo Joseph Von Hagen (1865-1939) was a geologist who rose to prominence in
    the oil industry in the 1920s. A native of Germany, he lived in Westchester
    County, NY but consulted widely in Illinois, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and
    elsewhere. He predicted the success of the Sigler gusher near Vernon, TX. He
    worked alongside his daughter Hildegard Von Hagen Kelley (born 1894), who
    played an active role in scouting drill sites and wrote at least one
    technical article for the Texas Oil Reporter. She apparently compiled these
    scrapbooks, and may have been the photographer--she apparently does not
    appear in any of the photographs, but she is frequently mentioned in the
    letters and articles. <br><br>The earlier of these two scrapbooks contains
    mostly clippings regarding Von Hagen's geology work, 1908-27, but also 19
    letters and manuscripts, 1908-1931; 2 printed documents; and 38 photographs
    relating to oil field development. Also of interest is a photostat of a
    detailed report on artesian well drilling in Millville, NJ, 1917. The second
    album contains 156 mostly well-captioned photographs from 1926-27, a mix of
    oil well shots in Arkansas and family photographs from New York. One unusual
    highlight is a shot of an American Indian skeleton unearthed while digging a
    foundation at the family home in Waccabuc, NY.

  TYPESET: >-
    4 manuscript documents, 9¾ x 7¾ inches or smaller; the earliest quite worn

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    These documents trace the history of a silver set. The Rev. John Jekyll
    (1739-1777) had been raised in Boston, where his father had been a customs
    collector. In 1769 he began serving as Vicar of Evercreech back in England.
    For some reason his family silver was entrusted to a second cousin, Charles
    Willing (1738-1788)--their mothers were first cousins from the Shippen
    family. Willing then passed the silver to his brother-in-law Samuel Powel
    (1738-1793) and his wife Elizabeth Willing Powel (1742-1830). Samuel served
    as mayor of Philadelphia, and Elizabeth was a confidante of George
    Washington and other patriot leaders. Upon Elizabeth's death in 1830, the
    silver was handed over to Charles Willing's grandson, Thomas Willing Morris
    (1792-1852). <br><br>Offered here are two memoranda signed by the famed
    socialite Elizabeth Willing Powel, listing the silver and explaining its
    history, in 1798 (quite worn and stained) and 1821 (a much cleaner version).
    Also included is an 1830 formal estate appraisal of the silver upon her
    death; and a receipt signed by Thomas Willing Morris upon taking possession
    of the silver.

    Unmatched 4to ½-calf rebacked with tape and 8vo full calf with chipped
    backstrip, minor wear to each; 4 diary leaves excised from second volume,
    otherwise minimal wear to contents.
  FOOTNOTE: ' Samuel Bonnell Jr. (1824-1885) kept this diary as a young man advancing in the world, from working as a clerk in his hometown of Philadelphia, to two months in the hardware business in New Orleans, to life as a general store owner and coal mine investor in Wilkes-Barre, PA. In November 1854, he married Mary Seymour "Quita" Oliver (1823-1912), and in late January 1855 she assumed responsibility for keeping the diary, continuing through the end of the second volume that November. <br><br>The Philadelphia portion of the diary is mainly concerned mainly with Bonnell''s busy social calendar, particularly the first week spent on a beach vacation in Cape May, NJ: dancing, ten-pins, bathing, walks with a variety of ladies. He was active in his local Rough & Ready Club, supporting Zachary Taylor''s campaign for president, with Taylor''s inauguration noted approvingly on 5 March 1849. A long entry of 16 December 1848 describes the "California fever raging intensely among us"; he contemplates various Californian schemes and associations in the months to come, and his brother George eventually does go west (see 8 May 1850 entry). Samuel''s descent into decadence bottoms out on 21 December 1848 with his attendance at a book auction: "Stopped at Lord''s auction, will have a sale this evening--would like to buy Legends of the Rhine, a book on the treatment of horses. . . . bought a treatise on gardening for 25¢."<br><br>On 10 January 1850 he departs for New Orleans by steamboat and rail, with an extended stop at Charleston, SC. At his destination, he soon proclaims "don''t like New Orleans, too much mud & wet," and even Mardi Gras was rained out: "for those who felt so inclined to mask & parade the streets, it was so rainy this time . . . . many of the streets were overflown." He was invited to attend the wedding of two enslaved people owned by a friend''s family, describing their clothing in detail (14 February 1850). Receiving an offer from his old Philadelphia employer, he beat a hasty retreat northward, this time up the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers and Lake Erie, describing his journey from 23 March to 14 April 1850. He returned to work for the coal dealers Roberts, Walton & Co.<br><br>The second diary begins on 22 April 1851 with his imminent departure for Wilkes-Barre, PA. There, he ran a general store catering to miners, and invested in a coal mine as well. On 27 May 1851 he critiques the welding work for an elevator at the mine shaft. His entries peter out by October 1851 and resume with a good account of his 30 November 1854 wedding to Quita near her home at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, NY. It went well, but "the servants did not see the wedding, for which disappointment they were not in the best humor for several days." His diary entries again grew brief and sporadic, and Quita felt the need to editorialize in her own hand on 22 January 1855. When he wrote "Heavy storm last night," she added "Quita''s bones were almost broken by the stage," and the next day she added "Quita still aching at every limb from the violent exercise in the Tomaqua stage." From that point onward, it was her diary, allowing her to comment on her new small-city life in Wilkes-Barre: "Much to my amusement or perhaps annoyance, I find most of the ladies and gentlemen here rather of the rough order" (25 January). She lived to travel, with a trip to New York to close the diary being a highlight. '

    A complete run of the original 12 volumes of this seminal American magazine.
    The negotiations over the United States Constitution are a central focus of
    the first 6 volumes. Most notable is a printing of the 17 September 1787
    version in seven articles, printed in the September 1787 issue, pages
    276-284. The Bill of Rights is printed in the second appendix of Volume VII.
    <br><br>The May 1789 issue contains the first American printing of the
    famous deck plan of the slave ship Brooks, titled "Plan of an African Ship's
    Lower Deck, with Negroes in the Proportion of Not Quite One to a Ton,"
    folding out to 5¼ x 16 inches. It was one of the most powerful images of the
    early anti-slavery movement. Appearing as the frontispiece of the March 1789
    issue is an engraved map, "Chart of the Gulf Stream," folding out to 8¾ x 9¾
    inches, with some separation at folds but complete. The November 1789 issue
    features an engraving of a young enslaved child from Maryland who was born
    without arms. <br><br>Other highlights include the Federalist Papers, Nos.
    1-6 as published in the November and December 1787 issues; and "Address of
    the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, Rhode-Island, to the President of the
    United States of America, August 17, 1790" in an appendix to Volume IX, page
    40. <br><br>This volume is a mixed edition. The first 11 volumes are each
    bound with a rarely seen 1798 collective title page, presumably issued to
    make the 12 volumes complete with the revived Volume XIII issued that year.
    However, each volume seems to consist of individual issues culled from
    Carey's inventory--Volumes I through III being a mix of different editions,
    and the later volumes apparently made up of first-edition issues, with the
    occasional subscriber list or other preliminary omitted. The magazine
    contents are complete except for 7 missing leaves as noted. <br><br>This
    magazine is rarely seen in a complete run, as the great value of the slave
    ship engraving often causes it to be separated.

    Auguste Edouart (1789-1861) was a French artist who toured the United States
    from 1839 to 1849, making silhouette portraits for the young nation's elite.
    He kept a set of carefully cataloged duplicates, two of which are offered
    here. Most notable is Maria Hester Monroe Gouverneur (1802-1850), third
    child of the late fifth president, James Monroe. In 1820, she became the
    first child of a president to be married in the White House, when she
    married her father's private secretary Samuel Laurence Gouverneur. They were
    fixtures of Manhattan high society until her return to Washington in 1840.
    This portrait was taken on Houston Street in New York. On the same day, her
    husband's cousin Gouverneur S. Bibby (1790-1872) of New York was also
    captured in shadow. <br><br>The background of these portraits is given in
    detail in "American Silhouettes by August Edouart: A Notable Collection of
    Portraits Taken Between 1839-1849" by Arthur S. Vernay. Vernay acquired the
    entire set of Edouart's reference copies and dispersed them after a 1913
    exhibition in New York. His catalog lists both of these portraits on page
    60, although the president's daughter is there misidentified as Mrs. Maria
    K. Gouverneur Bibby.

    John Lindsay Dunlap (1798-1875) of Watertown, NY was an eccentric patent
    medicine salesman who ran for president in 1864. He declared Ulysses S.
    Grant as his running mate, although we find no evidence that Grant ever
    accepted this nomination, or was even aware of it. This broadside offers
    tribute to the brave soldiers of the Mexican War--not what we might expect
    in 1863. It also features a letter from a Union Army lieutenant from a
    Watertown regiment, asking Dunlap to run for president as "the second Henry
    Clay and the great war horse of the North." Dunlap's response: "Upon mature
    deliberation, I have reluctantly consented to let my name be used." At
    bottom is a small advertisement for Dunlap's patent medicines, comparing his
    accomplishments to Christopher Columbus, Cleopatra, and Napoleon Bonaparte.

    Letterpress circular, 7¾ x 4¾ inches, signed and addressed indecipherably in

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    In the 1864 presidential election, the eligibility of soldiers to vote was a
    hotly contested point. As most soldiers were loyal to Lincoln, Republicans
    fought hard for their right to vote, sponsoring amendments to several state
    constitutions to allow their absentee ballots. The Democrats predictably
    were opposed to the absentee ballots, alleging the possibility of fraud.
    <br><br>Maine had a constitutional amendment for absentee soldier voting on
    the ballot for their September 1864 state elections. This circular letter,
    headed "Confidential," begins "It is important to prevent the adoption of
    the proposed amendment to the Constitution, under which absent soldiers are
    allowed to vote in November." It was issued by the state's Democratic Party
    leadership in an effort to thwart this amendment. It begins with allegations
    that "such an arrangement will expose us to great frauds" as "the
    Republicans will only act in character in resorting to every expedient to
    defeat us." It then lays out the tactic: a secret effort to draw Democrats
    to the poorly-attended local elections in September without drawing any
    public attention: "It would not be wise to discuss it, either in the
    newspapers or on the stump, but by personal interviews have the leading men
    . . . urged to see that all opponents of fraud and corruption vote against
    the proposed amendment." <br><br>With the aid of soldiers' votes, Lincoln
    easily carried Maine in the 1864 voting that November, beating the Democrat
    McClelland by 59% to 41%, and down-ballot the Republican Governor Samuel
    Cony also won re-election.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Members of the Society of Friends who remained adamantly pacifist during the
    Revolution were subject to punishment and harassment. This did not end with
    the fighting. This circular letter addressed to the president and General
    Assembly of Pennsylvania complains that in the wake of the Yorktown victory,
    when Philadelphia Quakers did not join in the celebrations on 24 October,
    they met with "companies of licentious people parading the streets,
    destroying the windows and doors of our houses, breaking into and plundering
    some of them." It goes on to explain their pacifism at great length,
    emphasizing that "it is not from imitation or for the support of ancient
    custom, but from a conviction of judgment, that we are led into the same
    practice with our ancestors." They observe that "the dispensation of war,
    bloodshed and calamity which hath been permitted to prevail on this
    continent is very solemn and awful," but they assure the assembly of their
    "desires and endeavors to promote the real good of our country, and that we
    are Your Friends." <br><br>The document is headed with its date and the
    caption "On the 26th ultimo a committee of six Friends, by appointment
    waited on the President of the Executive Council, and the Speaker of the
    General Assembly with Copies of the following Representation." A powerful
    expression of Quaker principles at a moment when they were most challenged.

  TYPESET: >-
    Autograph Letter Signed as "A.C.E." to mother Julia Franklin Williams of

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    While describing the religious revival meetings near her home in western
    Tennessee, the author writes: "The [religious] meeting at Dyer was
    absolutely broke up. Major Davidson came in, walked into the pulpit, took
    hold of the preacher's arm, said Trenton had dispatched to them for all the
    help they could get immediately. The negroes were coming in force against
    them. Everybody was on their feet instantly and great excitement prevailed.
    The country were all roused in a little time." Trenton was about 5 miles
    south of Dyer in western Tennessee. <br><br>This letter almost certainly
    relates to a mass arrest and lynching of 16 Black men in Gibson County, TN,
    as described in the long and perhaps semi-objective account in the Nashville
    Tennessean of 27 August 1874. The incident began on Saturday, 22 August in a
    dispute over fifty cents between a white and Black man in Picketsville. Two
    young white men were then shot at while riding through the woods. Rumors
    spread that "the negroes were organizing armed companies" and that
    "President Grant would back the negroes in whatever course they took against
    the whites. . . . Their object in organizing thoroughly was to shoot
    KuKlux." A white posse was summoned to arrest 16 alleged ringleaders of this
    plot on 25 August, and they were placed in jail at the county seat in
    Trenton, KY. At 1 a.m. that morning, a crowd of about a hundred masked men
    rode into town, "compelled the Sheriff to surrender the keys," and took the
    16 prisoners, who were then killed in various horrible ways. The newspaper
    reported that "the wildest excitement existed throughout the country, owing
    to rumors of negroes marching in strong force for Picketsville, and rumors
    of their having murdered two white women. On the other hand, the negroes
    were terribly alarmed, and many fled to the woods, fearing the fate of those
    taken from the Trenton jail." The mob being recruited at the Dyer church
    meeting was probably not the arresting posse of 25 August or the lynch mob
    formed that evening, but rather the defense against the feared vengeful
    "negroes marching in strong force" the next day.

  CROSSHEAD: Long-running barter account between Governor Greene and General Varnum.
  at-a-glance: 'No place, 13 March 1788'
  TYPESET: >-
    Autograph Document Signed by William Greene Jr., additionally signed by
    James Mitchell Varnum. One page, 12¾ x 15¾ inches, docketed on verso; folds,
    toning, separations at folds with tape repairs on verso.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This document shows almost eight years of barter accounts between two of
    Rhode Island's most prominent figures from the American Revolution. James
    Mitchell Varnum (1748-1789) graduated from what became Brown University,
    practiced law in East Greenwich, RI, and then served as a general in the
    Continental Army during the Revolution. He was noted for enlisting enslaved
    people into the First Rhode Island Regiment in exchange for their freedom,
    and for his service at the Battle of Rhode Island and Valley Forge. William
    Greene Jr. (1731-1809) of Warwick, RI served as governor of Rhode Island
    from 1778 to 1786, a period including the long British occupation of
    Newport, the American victory, and Rhode Island's act for the gradual
    emancipation of the enslaved. <br><br>On the left side of this document are
    debts incurred by Varnum to Greene, and on the right the services rendered
    by Varnum to repay the debts. The earliest entry was in June 1780, just
    after Varnum's election to the Continental Congress, when Governor Greene
    sent "six barrels racked sider delivered you in Providence." Perhaps Varnum
    shared some of this cider with the French General Rochambeau, whose troops
    came to Providence for an extended stay the following month. <br><br>From
    1783 to 1788, Greene provided Varnum with a steady supply of farm goods and
    services from his substantial Warwick estate: keeping his horse and oxen,
    and sending butter, wood, corn, onions, and hay. Typically for the period,
    these men of means trusted that the debt would be settled at some point,
    either by cash, goods, or services. Varnum's opportunity to reciprocate came
    in November 1784. The governor's son Ray Greene had just graduated from
    Yale, and was interested in pursuing a law career. Varnum agreed to tutor
    the youth for two years for £30, a solid investment--Ray Greene later became
    a United States Senator. Varnum also rented Greene some office space for 12
    weeks, returned some old cider barrels, and settled the nearly decade-long
    account with a mere 4½ pence. Both men signed at the bottom on 13 March
    1788, signifying that the account was officially balanced. General Varnum
    moved to the western frontier as an early Ohio settler soon afterward, where
    he died of tuberculosis within a year. This account documents the
    longstanding relationship between two figures of great significance to the
    state's history.

  CROSSHEAD: Patent exploitation license for an early American washing machine.
  at-a-glance: 'Rowley, MA, 18 March 1800'
  TYPESET: >-
    Party printed document, signed twice by Elias Weld and witnesses. 2 pages,

    minor foxing.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The first American patent was issued in 1790, and the number issued in
    following years was modest. Patent holders would attempt to capitalize by
    licensing their new discoveries to manufacturers across the country. The
    first American patent for a washing machine was issued to Nathaniel Briggs
    in 1797. Less is known about the second washing machine patent, issued to
    Ezra Weld of Braintree, MA on 26 June 1799. The original patent papers have
    long since been lost to fire. However, Weld had contract forms printed to
    set forth the terms of his standard agreement. <br><br>Offered here is one
    of Weld's license agreements for "the exclusive right and liberty of making,
    using, and vending to others to be used, his new and useful improvement,
    called Lavater and Wringer, for the washing and wringing of clothes." The
    license was granted by Weld's son Elias Weld (1772-1863) to Captain James
    Chute of Rowley, MA for a period of 14 years "in the towns of Rowley,
    Ipswich, Gloucester, Hambleton [Hamilton], Manchester, Wenham, and the
    parish of Byfield"--a large portion of Essex County north of Salem. For
    these rights, Chute paid a fee of $214 on 18 March 1800. A duplicate
    printing of the same form appears on the second integral leaf, featuring
    nearly identical license to Captain Chute--this time signed in Elias's
    hometown of Amesbury, MA, with a date of 4 June 1801 and a fee of $300.
    <br><br>The Rev. Ezra Weld (1736-1816) served for almost 50 years as a
    Congregational minister in Braintree, MA, but very little is known about his
    side work as a washing machine inventor--it is not mentioned in his lengthy
    profile in Yale's "Biographical Sketches." However, the invention seems to
    have found at least modest success. Weld's fellow minister Timothy Alden, in
    an 1801 sermon titled "The Glory of America. A Century Sermon,' mentioned in
    passing that Weld's washing machine was "a great improvement upon all other
    machines of the kind, and is coming into general use in many parts of the
    country." In the early federal period, when such a list was still feasible,
    his invention sometimes shows up in a list of all American patents, such as
    in the May 1806 issue of the Medical Repository, page 111-2. Weld was
    licensing the patent at least through 28 April 1804, when one of his other
    assignees ran an advertisement in a Rutland, VT newspaper: "To save labor
    and that of females, cannot here be unimportant. To spare the toils of the
    wife must be an object with any husband." <br><br>No other examples of this
    licensing agreement have been traced; it sheds new light on an obscure but
    significant early American invention.

    very presents. A boat passing from Holston to Natchez with 32 souls on board
    last June was taken at the Mussel Shouls on the Tennesee River by the
    Cherokees. The negroes were made prisoners, the whites were slaughtered in a
    most barberous manner."<br><br>The author also reports on his uncle Dr. John
    Sappington, who had somehow lost a small inheritance: "He has by some means
    spent it all & how, I can hardly tell you. He neither wore nor drank it, but
    labourd hard while people cheated him out of it, and he not being well
    acquainted with mankind they took advantage on every side. He likewise made
    some bad bargains. . . . The last accounts we had of him, he was at a place
    called Oppalusa in the Spanish dominions [Opelousas, LA]. People there say
    he is making money by physic." <br><br>He also offers updates on the
    family's enslaved people: "Father owns Tobias, a gentleman by the name of
    Molloy owns Billy who lives about half a mile from us. Billy has four
    children by Rachel, two girls and two boys. . . . The Negroes all give their
    kindest love to you and your people." <br><br>The author was likely Francis
    Boyce Sappington (1781-1800), son of Dr. Mark Brown Sappington (1746-1803)
    of Nashville, then a small settlement of about 300 (see lots 42, 159, and
    160 for related papers).

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    David Newton Bell (1797-1882) came to Tennessee as a young boy and became a
    prominent citizen in the Chattanooga area. The first 25 pages of this
    memorandum book are devoted to his work as a clock wholesaler from 1836 to
    1839. In partnership with G.C. Torbett, he bought clocks in bulk from famed
    Connecticut clockmakers Eli Terry & Co. and Silas Hoadley, as well as the
    lesser-known Mark Leavenworth. From Hoadley he ordered dozens of "square
    tops," "scroll tops," and the pricy "alarm Franklins," and from Terry he
    ordered "brass clocks" and "spiral bells," which were then shipped to
    retailers in Nashville and smaller Tennessee towns such as Carrollville,
    Blair's Ferry, and Athens. Clocks were ordered with or without "waits"
    (weights) to allow for one day, 30 hours, or 8 days between winding;
    ornamented glass is sometimes specified. These accounts were all crossed off
    as settled by 1842. <br><br>In 1838, Bell embarked on a yet more lucrative
    venture, selling land in the Ocoee District in Polk, Bradley and Monroe
    Counties, in the state's southeast corner. This land had been vacated by the
    1835 Cherokee Removal Act and the ensuing Trail of Tears, and opened for
    settlement on 1 October 1838. Pages 30 to 43 are a long list of Ocoee tracts
    which Bell "entered" on behalf of various settlers and investors, mostly in
    160-acre lots, after paying "entry money" and "good will money." Many of the
    entries are annotated with notes on their "disposal," such as "Fractional
    township sold by a decree of court, I bought 25 acres and sold 20 to
    Vaughan." One tract which Bell bought in 1838 for $2600 is noted as sold in
    1875 for $13,000. Pages 50 to 110 contain transcripts of grants issued by
    the state of Tennessee to Bell, 1839-1840. Finally, in the rear of the
    volume is a two-page list of land still in Bell's possession as of 1871: 10
    lots totaling more than 1,000 acres. Laid in is a single 1842 receipt issued
    to Bell by the "Entry Taker's Office" for the Ocoee District in Cleveland,
    TN, on a form printed in Athens, TN.

    George Jones (1810-1879) was born in England but came to Boston as a young
    boy, and gained fame as an actor there and New York. In 1836, he toured
    England, where this portrait was done "in the character of Hamlet as
    successfully performed at Drury Lane upon the occasion of his complimentary
    benefit from the Friends of Literature and the Drama, June 4th, 1836." It is
    the earliest portrait of Jones we have been able to trace. After this point,
    Jones became more famous for being famous than for his acting:
    megalomaniacal press conferences, lawsuits against fellow celebrities, a
    "grandiloquent" book on American Indians (see lot 4), and the assumption of
    the pretentious title "George, Count Joannes" all followed. One copy in

    John Otis Wattles (1813-1859) was raised in the Quaker faith and was a
    committed antislavery activist, participant in the Underground Railroad, and
    leader of a series of Utopian communities; he later became a friend and
    supporter of John Brown. This letter was written to another prominent
    antislavery activist, Ichabod Morton (1790-1861) of Plymouth, MA, whose
    interest in social experiments had led him to live briefly at the legendary
    Brook Farm in 1842. His daughter was the prominent women's rights activist
    Abby Morton Diaz.<br><br>Wattles begins with thanks for the approval of "one
    who dwells hard by the Pilgrim Rock" (Morton was a descendant of the first
    Pilgrims at Plymouth). He discusses Morton's famous daughter: "Then there is
    Abigail. You didn't tell me where she was nor what she is doing. When she
    wrote to me last, she had scalded her pot. I'd like to know what she is
    doing now." <br><br>Moving on to Utopia: "You say 'we must not expect to see
    the celestial city too suddenly'--well, let us see it as soon as we can
    then. If we cannot get into it ourselves, let us get so near it that we can
    poke the next generation in. . . . A community is in successful operation at
    Grand Basin at this time, the rest have failed from debt." Then Wattles lays
    out his latest plan, to form a Western Educational Association as a
    "self-supporting school on the manual labor plan. . . . The system of
    education shall be such as shall bring the students to a consideration of
    the great principles of brotherhood" and after clearing its debt "they can,
    by uniting themselves & families, become a self-supporting community. This
    may be slow, but isn't it sure?" He proposes a trip eastward with Dr. Hiram
    Gilmore of Cincinnati High School (the pioneering secondary school for
    African-American students) to visit like-minded organizations and gather
    information. Initial funding will come from Dr. Gilmore (heir to perhaps
    $30,000) and other donors. Wattles concludes with thanks to Morton for his
    financial support, the bulk of which goes "for printing the Herald . . . the
    little paper is extensively circulated, particularly in the new parts of the
    west." <br><br>Wattles would soon buy out the remnants of a Fourierist
    utopian community in Utopia, OH. His young community was destroyed by a
    flood in December 1847, killing most of its members.

    In anticipation of a British campaign against the Gulf Coast, President
    Madison ordered Louisiana to raise a militia unit for its own defense. Peace
    negotiations to end the war were already underway, but rumors flew that the
    British would attempt to reverse the Louisiana Purchase and restore the
    territory to Spain. Governor Claiborne editorializes: "A project so
    chimerical, illy comports with that character for wisdom, to which the
    English government aspires." Still, better safe than sorry: "In case of
    invasion, the whole militia will be ordered to front the enemy. If our homes
    and fire sides are menaced, union, zeal and mutual confidence should warm
    every heart and strengthen every arm." The British did indeed launch a Gulf

    Scouting narrative by a lieutenant who later died with his brother-in-law

    Autograph Manuscript Signed with title "A Scout in Arizona," 13 pages, 12¼ x
    7¾ inches, bound at top by a single metal fastener; folds, minor wear.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    James Calhoun (1845-1876) came from a wealthy Cincinnati family and joined
    the Union Army in 1864, becoming a career infantry officer. In January 1868
    he went west with the 32nd Infantry to Fort Grant, Arizona; his regiment was
    consolidated into the 21st Infantry in August 1869. He later gained a most
    unfortunate fame as brother-in-law and comrade in arms to George Armstrong
    Custer at Little Bighorn. <br><br>Offered here is a narrative which
    Lieutenant Calhoun wrote while stationed at Fort Grant. It describes a
    scouting expedition which took place between February 1869 (when Colonel
    John Green assumed control of the post) and August 1869 (when General Thomas
    Devin was transferred from the District of Arizona). A band of Apaches had
    driven off a herd of cattle near Tucson, and Calhoun was sent to accompany a
    detachment of 30 cavalry in pursuit up the San Pedro River. <br><br>This is
    not an official report. Apparently written and signed shortly after the
    expedition, it is filled with sarcasm and amusing narrative details. The
    expedition falls in with a band of 4 Mexican civilians who were also hunting
    the Apaches. Calhoun hints broadly that these Mexicans were actually doing
    their best to avoid a confrontation, lighting large fires at night to warn
    of their approach. A full day's march from the camp, the expedition realized
    that nobody had thought to pack any provisions, forcing the men to live on
    whatever rations were in their packs. They continued up and over numerous
    mountains at great hazard to their horses, traveling by night when possible:
    "Walking at night over a ground covered with cactus and leading a horse who
    objects to being led are things that must be experienced to be appreciated."
    After 4 days they gave up the hunt and began a return to Fort Grant via the
    Aravaipa Canyon, "through which none of our party had ever been, and in fact
    but one party of white men ever had been through." The steep walls and slow
    progress made them vulnerable to ambush. At one point, with the Mexicans
    traveling ahead, the cavalrymen heard a barrage of gunfire. Rushing toward
    the fight, "as we rode up to them, the firing ceased for a moment, and
    someone informed us they were firing at a turkey. There they all commenced
    again and at last brought down a game old gobbler weighing about 25 pounds.
    There must have been two thousand shots fired at that unfortunate bird and
    he was only hit once." They returned safely to Fort Grant "and wondered if
    there was anything in the world more pleasant than a trip in the wild
    mountains of Arizona." <br><br>In January 1871, Calhoun was transferred to
    George Armstrong Custer's famous 7th United States Cavalry. The following
    year he married his commander's sister Margaret Custer, becoming one of
    several extended Custer family members in the regiment. At the Battle of the
    Little Bighorn, he was in temporary command of Company L, and died alongside
    the rest of his men atop what is now known as Calhoun Hill.

  DESCRIPT: (WEST--COLORADO.) Jonathan L. Cresson.
  CROSSHEAD: A group of long and detailed letters from the early days of Denver.
  at-a-glance: 'Denver, CO and various places, 1862-70'
  TYPESET: >-
    9 Autograph Letters Signed (most simply as "Jont") to his cousin Anne Hannum
    Cresson of Conshohocken, PA; one letter torn and repaired, but generally
    minimal wear; one with an enclosure of a small fragment of what appears to
    be silver ore. Most with original postmarked stamped envelopes.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Denver was founded in 1858, and this lot includes four long detail-packed
    letters written there in 1865 and 1866, full of wagon trains, mountain
    trips, mining adventures, bucket-brigade fire-fighting, and wild coyotes.
    Our correspondent, Jonathan Leedom Cresson (1844-1930) was, according to the
    1860 census, an apprentice in the dry goods business in Philadelphia by the
    age of 16; he shows up in the 1870 census of Kit Carson, CO as a grocer. He
    mentions his work as a civilian storekeeper for the federal quartermaster
    department in the letters. He came from a Pennsylvania Quaker family;
    writing to his younger cousin Ann Hannum Cresson back home, he uses the
    traditional Quaker "thee" and "thy" although he sidesteps standard Quaker
    practice by applying the mainstream names of the months.<br><br>The first
    western letter, 21 September 1865, was written the day after his arrival in
    Denver, and runs to 12 pages. It is mainly devoted to his journey in from
    Julesburg, CO by wagon. He names and describes the key members of his wagon
    train. Lowry, for example, is "a rough mountain genius and beats anything
    swearing that I have ever yet come across, but for all as good hearted a
    chap as ever lived." He describes the first sight of the Rockies after
    slogging across the sandy desert; coyotes surrounding the wagons during chow
    time, making "the most infernal racket imaginable"; and killing a ten-foot
    rattlesnake with a big stick--he saved the rattle as a trophy.<br><br>The 6
    October 1865 letter (9 pages in length) describes a four-day trip to Golden
    City up in the mountains to help his friend Lowry deliver a load of
    vegetables. There he observes the process of gold mining at length, and
    visits several silver mines: "I procured some specimens and left them to
    their work." One of those samples remains tucked in with the letter. During
    his explorations, Cresson got separated from his friend and walked 15 miles
    toward home before nightfall; he nearly had to sleep out in the open in
    light snow, but was taken in by a hay wagon party and fed. He also shares a
    secret with his cousin: "Thee may sometimes find in the [Philadelphia?]
    Evening Bulletin letters signed T.J., they are the efforts of my mighty
    brain." <br><br>On 25 March 1866, Cresson announces that he has been offered
    command of the entire quartermaster storehouse, replacing his former
    employer who was ignorant and disagreeable. Fire has destroyed part of
    town--"there is not a single fire engine in town and the only method of
    subduing a fire is by buckets of water." On 21 September, he describes a
    recent trip to the mountains up the Blue River, hunting sage hens.
    <br><br>His later letters were written elsewhere in the west. 17 December
    1868 found him passing through a former railroad construction hub 50 miles
    west of Cheyenne, WY--"all that remains are a few old shanties, some of them
    still occupied as saloons." There he saw a herd of confused antelopes racing
    against a train. On 7 July 1870, he was in Kit Carson, CO, where "the end of
    the track has passed so far beyond that we no more feel the influence of
    construction gangs, tiehaulers, & the various other RR employees in our
    business." Finally, he travelled eastward to Sauk City, WI, where he wrote
    on 3 November that "these Red River country people are mostly halfbreeds,
    descendants of the early French missionaries and traders by intermarriage
    with the Indians. Their language is a sort of mongrel French and Indian, few
    of them speaking any English at all." He concluded: "I do consider anyone
    who would compare the natural beauty of this state to grand old Colorado an
    idiot."

    Construction on the Northern Pacific Railroad began in 1870 from Minnesota
    and the Pacific coast, and both sides met in Powell County, Montana. The
    railroad's president Henry Villard led a grand excursion to the site to lay
    a ceremonial final spike, which was driven in by former United States
    president Ulysses S. Grant (not shown here). Documenting the scene was the
    well-known western photographer Frank Jay Haynes (1853-1921), the official
    photographer for Northern Pacific. Two of the photographs show a delegation
    of Crow Indians at the site; another shows the festively decorated first
    locomotive to cross over the last spike. This lot includes: <br><br>8 of the
    23 imperial views from Haynes's series, "The Villard Gold Spike Excursion,
    Opening of the Northern Pacific Railroad, Septe. 8, 1883," albumen prints

    An interesting cross-cultural photographic archive from early Oklahoma. In
    1901, the federal government set aside land from the Kiowa, Comanche and
    Arapaho reservations southwest of Oklahoma City and held a public auction of
    land in the new town of Anadarko. These photographs were gathered by one of
    the original white settlers, George W. Conover (1848-1936), who had first
    come to Oklahoma as a soldier and trader in 1867. The photographs depict
    both Indian and settler life. 3 smaller photographs, about cabinet
    card-sized, are by Mrs. C.R. [Annette] Hume and depict Kiowa women plus
    Towaconie Jim, chief of the Wichitas. Most of the other photographs are
    larger (up to 5 x 8 inches) and on plain mounts, possibly by the firm of
    Irwin & Mankins, including 5 depicting unnamed American Indians and their
    settlements. One group of settlers is captioned in the negative "First jury
    in Anadarko, Sept. 5 1901," while in another, men pose before a crude tent
    occupied by the First National Bank of Anadarko (illustrated). Conover is
    identified in several images: in a Masonic group portrait; standing with
    fellow hunters in front of dressed deer in "A Hunting Scene"; on horseback
    in a line of cavalrymen; and in his horse-drawn wagon with an
    African-American assistant. Finally, a cabinet card of a young soldier taken
    in New Brunswick, NJ may be Conover as a young man. Accompanying the
    photographs are a grazing lease of tribal lands issued to Conover in 1901,
    and a 1936 issue of the Anadarko American-Democrat featuring a long obituary
    of Conover. <br><br>WITH--an interesting Anadarko photograph with possibly

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Sisterdale was a predominantly German settlement in the Texas Hill Country,
    founded in 1847. One of its earliest businesses was a water-cure clinic
    founded by philosopher Ernst Kapp (1808-1896), who had just recently fled
    Germany as a political dissident and became the locus of a community of
    free-thinkers and abolitionists. One of his patients here offers detailed
    commentary on this interesting time and place. He begins with a discussion
    of his health: "I cannot say since the first excitement has fully subsided
    that there is any perceptible improvement in my general health other than an
    increase of strength & cheerfulness. . . . The doctor says that the
    treatment has not yet brought my condition to what he calls a crisis, but
    says with apparent confidence that all my symptoms are favorable & that a
    crisis is near, after which my progress to health shall be both rapid &
    certain. . . . You will have but little time to devote to books if you will
    strictly follow the Doctor's prescriptions. . . . Your outfit must include
    two blankets, four Osnaburgh bedsheets, a few towels & a syringe." One
    disturbance to the peace is "rumours of Indian depredations from abroad &
    even from the immediate neighborhoods of the largest towns." <br><br>Moving
    on to the surprising intellectual ferment of Sisterdale, he explains: "The
    only question of excitement among the Germans here now is slavery, on which
    there is a considerable division among the German population of San Antonio,
    New Braunfels & Fredericksburg. I have attended a party a few weeks ago
    which in selectness, behavior & taste throughout would do credit to the
    aristocracy of Jamestown, Va. I was indeed surprised to perceive the tone &
    cast of the community in this settlement, among which there are men of the
    highest & best calibratted minds. They are now forming a club which is to
    meet once a week for the purpose of aiding each other in learning the
    English language & interchanging sentiments on different & general
    subjects."

    10 total pages, various sizes, minor wear and foxing.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The first of these letters is written from Washington, awaiting his ocean
    liner to New Orleans. Later in February 1867, he reports on his arrival in
    Houston: "I am very much pleased with this town, would like to live here if
    I could get in any business," but he notes that in February "it is as warm
    as June in Virginia," and he has not seen any pretty ladies since leaving
    Virginia: "I think they are scarce in Texas or keep themselves very close."
    On 29 July 1867, he writes from Anderson in Grimes County, further inland,
    again noting the heat: "There are few white men who work here this time of
    year, & those that do work go out about sun up in morning & work till 9
    o'clock & then lay by until four in the evening before they go out again."
    He considered going into sheep: "it will be three or four years before you
    can realize anything, but when your money does begin to come in, it all
    comes at once." <br><br>The author of these letters is tough to identify. He
    signs variously as "Joe" or "J.M. Chan"[?]. He is clearly from the
    Middleburg area of Loudoun County, VA. At one point he jokes that at the
    local Middleburg picnic dances, "Rush can take my place on the floor now."
    The only Rush we find in Loudoun County in 1860 was a Rush Wallace living
    with the extended Chancellor family, next door to a Joseph Mason, aged 12,
    living in the home of wealthy lawyer Lorman Chancellor. An adopted son,

    Maclyn Arbuckle (1866-1931) was a popular stage actor in the 1890s who made
    a successful transition into film during the silent era. Born in San
    Antonio, TX, he remained associated with the state throughout his life, and
    his San Antonio Moving Pictures Corporation produced four films in 1922. He
    succeeded in both comic and dramatic roles. His cousin Roscoe, who performed
    as Fatty Arbuckle (1887-1933), went on to even greater success as a comic
    actor. <br><br>Offered here is a large archive of Maclyn Arbuckle's diaries,
    publicity photographs, theatrical manuscripts, correspondence, clippings,
    and other ephemera. The 16 manuscript diaries are in worn quarto notebooks,
    non-continuous but covering most of the period from 1882 to 1895. The
    earliest 4 volumes start with time in boarding school in West Newton, MA and
    Plymouth, NH, continuing through time as a young adult in Texas. His July to
    December 1887 diary is written as he pursues a law career in Texarkana, TX.
    He celebrates his 21st birthday on 9 July: "Tomorrow I begin in earnest as a
    man with determination to make a bright future for myself." Two days later
    he writes: "My business is picking up a little & I am gradually becoming
    reconciled to the fate of the young lawyer." On 16 July he was recruited for
    a baseball game, playing first base for the "Texas Side" against a nine from
    across the border in Arkansas. He frequently attended the theater, being
    moved to tears by an Effie Ellsler performance on 3 December 1887.
    <br><br>After that point, the diaries from 1891 to 1895 are written mostly
    while on tour as an actor. Perhaps the most interesting is his diary from
    August to October 1891, which begins as his theatrical career gets off the
    ground in Dallas. On 2 August he describes the opening night of his staging
    of "Ingomar the Barbarian": "When the curtain went down on the last act, I
    was proud of my little 'professional' company--not one had made the
    slightest error." Soon after, he goes on the road as a supporting player in
    another troupe, visiting a lunatic asylum in Lexington, KY (21 August) and
    bailing out three of his colleagues from a Maysville, KY prison on 7
    September: "They will remember Maysville several years from now. It was
    quite a scandal in town." The tour brought him back to Taylor, TX on 19
    October: "I am always very glad to enter the state as I meet my old friends
    in every town." <br><br>His parents faced bankruptcy and the loss of their
    home in 1893. From the road in Fort Wayne, IN, Arbuckle wrote "I am doing
    all I can to aid. I live in the cheap hotels, do not drink or indulge in any
    extra expense but send all home. . . . Must hold up and fight it out." The
    diaries nonetheless include some of the hijinks you might expect from a
    renowned comic actor. Backstage in Rochester, NY on 23 January 1895, "I
    caused quite a consternation in the orchestra, who were playing behind the
    scenes. . . . As I left the stage . . . I walked into the sawdust used for
    the horses & suddenly began doing handsprings in rapid succession. As I was
    made up to look 60 years old, the consternation which followed almost caused
    the orchestra to cease playing." <br><br>The approximately 200 photographs
    are mostly publicity images from Arbuckle's film career circa 1914-1922,
    approximately 8 x 10 inches, mounted on either side of detached scrapbook
    leaves, and generally well captioned. Well-represented films include "The
    County Chairman" (1914), "The Reform Candidate" (1915), "Fighting Mad"
    (1919) and--from the San Antonio Moving Pictures Company--"Mr. Bingle," "Mr.
    Potter of Texas," and "Squire Phin." A posed image from 1920 shows Arbuckle
    and his staff on the steps in front of his film company's offices. Others
    appear to be slightly earlier, from theatrical productions such as "The
    Circus Gent" and "The Welcher." One undated image shows Arbuckle and 6
    others--including a blurry Jack London--performing in the Bohemian Club's
    "Jinks." An early formal portrait is captioned on verso "1888, lawyer &
    candidate for Justice of Peace at Texarkana." The largest item is a cast
    photo of "Why Smith Left Home," 11½ x 16¼ inches, signed on mount by several
    cast members including Arbuckle, mount quite worn and chipped with loss of
    some signatures, 17 August 1898. <br><br>3 scripts are credited to Arbuckle:
    "The Reform Candidate," "His Own Medicine," and "Shylock Before the Court of
    Appeals," as well as his copies of 7 scripts credited to others, most
    notably "Gentleman from Texas" and "Mr. Potter of Texas." <br><br>A file of
    35 letters includes: 12 affectionate letters from Maclyn to his wife,
    1906-1922; a pair of letters to his mother, 1882 and 1888; a pair of his
    father's reference letters on behalf of Maclyn, who has "left his law office
    to seek renown for the fickle goddess fame on the boards," 1890; and more.
    <br><br>A thick file of manuscripts includes essays including "Animal
    Communications," transcripts of reviews, a series of treatments for a
    proposed series of one-reel playlets written with noted humorist Irvin Cobb
    called "Mr. Blunder," an 1897 song titled "The Sad Sound of the Mint Julep";
    and Maclyn's speech on his father. <br><br>Other highlights include a
    playbill from his 1891 Dallas production of "Ingomar" featuring a "company
    of excellent local talent," his running restaurant and cigar tab at a club
    called "The Lambs," 1920; and a pencil sketch of his house and garden.
    <br><br>Finally, what would an actor from this era be without his clippings?
    Two very thick folders of his clippings are included. <br><br>Also included
    are a few letters and documents relating to father James Graeme Arbuckle, a
    Dallas merchant who worked extensively with Latin America, including a
    certificate issued to as a Caballero of the Order of Isabella the Catholic,
    signed "Yo el Rey" for King Alonso XIII of Spain, 19¼ x 23 inches, 1912
    (mounted on board); 4 letters regarding his defense of the flag of Texas,
    1907; a large worn manuscript map of Oaxaca on tracing paper; and his
    typescript lecture "Adventures in Mexico in the Sixties."

    The Yakima War began with a series of rapidly escalating killings and
    reprisals between American settlers and Yakama Indians in Washington
    Territory, September and October of 1855. On 11 October 1855, the
    neighboring Oregon Territory called up a 800-man cavalry militia to help the
    cause, with supplies including 1,000 horses to be gathered by the
    territory's assistant quartermaster general Albert Zieber (1830-1890). This

  at-a-glance: 'Seneca Falls, NY, 1 June 1853'
  TYPESET: >-
    Volume 5, No. 11. 4 pages, 18½ x 12 inches, on one unbound folding sheet;

    (facsimile of the missing portion supplied), otherwise just folds and minor
    wear.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The Lily was the first American newspaper edited and published by a woman.
    Founded in 1849 by Amelia Bloomer (1818-1894) as a temperance publication,
    it soon began advocating less restrictive fashions for women (the
    "bloomers"). By 1853, it was working more overtly for women's rights. Its
    subscription pitch pledges to "labor zealously and earnestly for the
    emancipation of woman from the crushing evils of Intemperance--from the
    cruel enactments of unjust laws made without her consent--from the
    destructive influences of Custom and Fashion . . . and for her elevation to
    her true position in society of perfect and entire equality." <br><br>The
    unruly World's Temperance Convention in New York is described at length,
    with an all-star cast of women's rights advocates. Women were grudgingly
    accepted as delegates, but a proposal to place Susan B. Anthony on the
    Business Committee was ruled out of order. Women's rights advocate Thomas
    Wentworth Higginson then tried to surrender his own place on the committee
    in favor of Lucy Stone: "Then the confusion was at once renewed. Mrs. Abby
    Kelley Foster rose and endeavored to say a few words by way of explanation,
    but was interrupted by cries of order." <br><br>Other reports on temperance
    meetings mention Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton several times.
    Several other articles in this issue describe failed efforts by the
    male-dominated temperance movement to silence womens' voices. Rebutting a
    condescending article in the rival Teetotaller, an editorial asserts that
    "as women have been bossed all their lives, and had overseers over them,
    simple justice would decide it but right that men should now submit for a
    while and let women have their turn at bossing and overseeing." Advertisers
    include temperance and phrenological publications, water-cure
    establishments, the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania, and the
    publishers of a "Book for Bloomers" for "every advocate and wearer of the
    new costume." We trace no other issues of The Lily at auction.

    Harriet Barnes Griggs Barker (1845-1918), born in Roxbury, MA and then

    Elmer John Barker of the 5th New York Cavalry in McHenry, IL in 1876; they
    raised three sons and eventually settled in Crown Point, NY. Her
    daughter-in-law, Harriet Provost Fisher (1886-1974), successfully completed

    In September 1918, the United States sent about 5,000 troops to the northern
    Russian port of Arkhangelsk, in a British-led effort to support the White
    Russians against the Red Bolsheviks who had seized control of Russia. This
    small contingent was officially known as the American Expeditionary Force,
    North Russia--or, more commonly, the Polar Bear Expedition. They saw
    substantial combat; public support for their deployment plummeted after the
    November 1918 armistice with Germany. They began their withdrawal in June
    1919, and were gone from Russia by 5 August. <br><br>These photographs are
    about evenly divided between military and civilian views. Several of the
    scenes depict the American 310th Engineer Battalion; others show the
    defensive line at Kurgomin; the "Michigan Barracks" at Arkhangelsk; marching
    in formation to the "Army-Navy Game"; and a Memorial Day parade through the
    streets of Arkhangelsk (illustrated). A small number show British or
    Canadian troops. Probably the most famous member of the North Russian
    Expeditionary Force was a British officer, Ernest Shackleton, just a couple
    of years after his heroic escape from Antarctica. We don't see Shackleton in
    these photos, but the noted commander of the White Russian forces, Yevgeny
    Miller, can be seen addressing his troops--the only individual named in any
    of the captions. Civilian scenes from in and near Arkhangelsk ("Archangel")
    range from the city's cathedral to Laplanders with reindeer teams. A
    fascinating glimpse of the little-known and short-lived American occupation
    of Russia.

    The America First Committee was founded in 1940 to oppose American entry in
    the Second World War, soon gaining 800,000 dues-paying members. Their name
    and slogan sounded patriotic, but their leadership was tarnished by Nazi
    sympathies and antisemitism. A Boston rally featuring the group's leading
    spokesman Charles Lindbergh was cancelled on 7 December 1941 when the
    Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. The organization swiftly disbanded on the same
    day that Germany and Italy declared war on the United States. <br><br>These
    photographs were compiled to help expose links between the America First
    Committee and the Nazis. Many are annotated to prove the presence of known
    Nazi activists at AFC rallies and demonstrations. They come from the files

  DESCRIPT: (WORLD WAR TWO.) Yoshitsugu Saito.
  CROSSHEAD: Message from the Japanese commander at Saipan to his doomed troops.
  at-a-glance: 'Saipan, 6 July 1944'
  TYPESET: >-
    Carbon copy of an English-language translation of a general order issued by
    General Saito as commander of Japanese forces at Saipan, 9¾ x 7¾ inches; 2
    punch holes in upper margin, folds, minor wear; manuscript transmittal note
    in English in lower margin.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The Battle of Saipan began with a 15 June 1944 American assault. The island
    represented a final line of defense against direct air attacks on Japan, so
    the Japanese commander Yoshitsugu Saito vowed to fight to the last man
    against impossible odds. He issued this message on 6 July, near the end of
    the fighting: "For more than 20 days since the American devils attacked, the
    officers, men, and the civilian employees of the Imperial Army and Navy on
    this island have fought well and bravely. . . . Now we have no material with
    which to fight and our artillery for attack has been completely destroyed. .
    . . Whether we attack or stay where we are there is only death. . . . I will
    advance with those who remain to deliver still another blow to the American
    devils and leave my bones on Saipan as a bulwark of the Pacific. . . . I
    will never suffer the disgrace of being taken alive and I will offer up the
    courage of my soul and calmly rejoice in living by the eternal principle."
    The next morning his remaining 4,000 troops, many of them wounded, launched
    the largest human-wave suicide attack of the war. Nearly all of them were
    killed, taking 400 American soldiers with them. <br><br>Saito's captured
    final message was soon translated and distributed; it remains a haunting
    seminal text of the war. This copy was acquired by an unknown American
    soldier, who wrote "Danny: This fell into our hands some time ago. Above is
    a translation of the original message in Japanese."

  CROSSHEAD: 'Photographs from Daiquiri, Cuba including Jennings Cox.'
  at-a-glance: 'Daiquirí, Cuba, 1906-07 and undated'
  TYPESET: >-
    25 stereographic photographs, each with two mounted silver prints about 4¼ x
    3¼ inches, mounted on a plain 5 x 7-inch gray card, most with manuscript
    captions on mount recto and/or verso; minimal wear.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The American mining engineer Jennings Stockton Cox Jr. (1866-1913) is
    generally credited as the inventor of the daiquiri, the popular
    rum-lime-sugar cocktail. He was for many years the general manager of the
    Spanish-American Mining Company with holdings in and near the Cuban village
    of Daiquirí. These stereoview photographs show the mines and miners, and
    leisurely scenes at the "Casa Grande." Mr. Cox is identified at least
    twice--although he unfortunately does not raise a glass in any of them. In
    one titled "Before the gates ajar" he strolls through a tall open gate with
    his hands in his pockets. In the other, he stands with a group of three
    other named men in front of the same gate, December 1906 (Cox stands at
    left, illustrated). Another may show him on horseback receiving a cup of
    coffee from a servant, though he is not named. <br><br>These views were
    clearly produced for private use rather than commercial distribution. Almost
    all of the photographs are captioned "Casa Grande, Daiquiri" on verso, even
    those taken at the mines. Other highlights include a group of musicians and
    dancers titled "Cuban danza, Altagracia coffee plantation, Feb. 1907"; a
    child laborer captioned "An earnest worker"; 4 miners pushing an ore cart,
    captioned "The struggle for life"; Among the named mines are Lola,
    Magdalena, and San Antonio, as well as the Sigua cattle ranch. One of the
    images is lightly hand-colored, captioned "Mr. Charles Rand at Casa Grande's
    gate, Dec. 1906." These photographs may be of substantial interest for Cuban
    and mining history, even beyond the special importance of Cox to the annals
    of mixology.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (1648-1695) was a Mexican nun at the San Jerónimo
    Convent who, against all odds, became a prolific and well-regarded poet. Her
    prominence as an intellectual began to bring her in conflict with the church
    leadership after 1690. Two volumes of her collected works were published in
    1689 and 1692 (a posthumous volume followed in 1700) which contain virtually
    all that remains of her writings. In 1693 and 1694, she ceased writing, was
    forced to sell her extensive book collection, publicly repented, and was
    restricted to charity work among the poor. In 1695, while tending to her
    fellow sisters during an epidemic, she became fatally ill. Her reputation
    has only grown over the centuries. She now ranks among the most enduring
    literary figures of colonial Mexico, and a proto-feminist icon. Offered here
    is a set of early editions of her collected works, as follows.
    <br><br>"Inundacion castalida de la unica poetisa, musa decima." Toning,
    minor edge wear, moderate dampstaining, dark stain in lower corner scarcely
    affecting text. First edition. Madrid: Juan Garcia Infanzon, 1689.

    An unusual printed family history, in one of two editions printed in 1714
    from different settings of type. Swann sold an example of the other printing
    on 27 September 2018, lot 481. In the other printing, the woodcut "Al Rey"
    was in slightly larger letters, and it read "Nuestro Senor en el real"
    rather than "Nuestro Señor en su real." The other printing repeated the leaf
    number 28, and this one repeats number 27. Not in Medina or Palau, two
    copies copy in OCLC (at John Carter Brown Library and Indiana University).
