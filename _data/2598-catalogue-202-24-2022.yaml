The North American slave trade dates back to 1619, but in 1709 it was still substantially smaller and less organized than it would be even by the mid-1700s. We can find no manuscripts from this period of the North American trade at auction through Swann. Dartmouth College holds a similar bill of lading signed by Bedgood dated 1718.

    name Gustavus Vassa, and spent time in Barbados, Virginia, England,
    Montserrat, and Georgia before buying his own freedom in 1766. As a free man

    Th+I7e capture by the British Navy of the notorious French slave ship
    Vigilante was a reminder that the transatlantic slave trade still
    flourished, despite the Act of 1807. The Vigilante was found at the mouth of
    the river Bonny on the coast of West Africa, with 345 enslaved people
    aboard, in the company of several other slave ships. During the ensuing gun
    battle, some of the human cargo took the opportunity to jump overboard but
    were "devoured by the sharks." The crew of one of the defeated Spanish slave
    ships tried to detonate the ship's gunpowder as they departed, which would
    have killed all of the newly freed passengers. A graphic and disturbing
    account from the trans-Atlantic slave trade's long illicit period.
    <br><br>The plate is similar but distinct from the often-circulated "Plan of

    First edition, first state from the first print run of four thousand, of the

    powerful narrative was announced as "now in press" in the 15 April 1853 New
    York Times, and the editor's preface by David Wilson is dated May 1853. The
    Buffalo Daily Republic of 6 July 1853 announces that "10,000 copies . . .
    have been ordered." The Buffalo Commercial of 14 July 1853 announces that it
    "has this day issued from the press," but the very next day the Buffalo
    Daily Republic announced that "to-day the long looked for issue of the fifth
    thousand . . . will commence at Derby, Orton & Mulligan's." The initial
    print run of 4,000, such as this, was usually issued with two leaves of
    publisher's advertisements inserted between the front pastedown and front
    free endpaper. <br><br>The earliest printings (like this one) also list
    three publishers in Auburn, Buffalo, and Cincinnati. By 27 August 1853 the
    publisher reported in the Commercial that "15,000 copies of this thrilling
    narrative sold in four weeks." Later printings have been seen headed above
    the title "Fifth Thousand" (1853) through "Twenty-Ninth Thousand" (1856),

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    First edition. This Andrew Jackson (most definitely not the president) was
    legally born free to an enslaved father and a free mother in Kentucky, but
    was nonetheless raised in slavery and did field work until his eventual
    escape as a young man. He made his way to Wisconsin and did some lecturing
    for the abolitionist cause. This memoir was "narrated by himself, written by
    a friend," and concludes with 3 abolitionist "Songs of Freedom" by other
    authors. The friend was likely John N.T. Tucker, an author, newspaperman and
    abolitionist activist who was a Syracuse resident at the time. The Preface
    is signed "T", and one of the poems, titled Fugitive's Triumph, is by
    "J.N.T.T." <br><br>This example has the first-edition text, from the same
    setting of type as one sold by Swann on 25 March 2021, lot 4, right down to

    An early edition, issued without illustrations in the same year as the
    108-page first edition, printed by a pioneering cooperative owned and
    operated by women--and one of the very few slave narratives written and
    published in California. It is the story of a man who escaped from slavery
    in Maryland and made his way to the gold fields of California in 1851. He
    describes rescuing a girl from slavery in Sacramento, fleeing at gunpoint,
    and then being robbed by a prostitute in Mexico (page 31) before returning
    to California. Mining, brawls, reflections on racism, and failed business
    ventures all get coverage. He concludes his narrative with capsule histories
    of fellow fugitives such as Henry "Box" Brown and the Crafts, a history of
    the Modoc War, a list of stockholders in the Underground Railroad (page 98),
    and other curiosities, concluding with an account of the Yellow Jacket Mine

    Manuscript letter to Miss Martha Doolittle in Springfield, MA. 3 pages, 10 x

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    "My dear Matty, Your old Moma was delighted & very grateful to get such a
    nice kind letter from the family she had received so much kindness from &
    gratified that you should remember her with so much affection as to write to
    me. I should be very much pleased to be with you for a little while & see
    how comfortably fixed you are, but that country is too cold for me. I had
    rather be here where we do not need so much wood & warm clothing & shelter
    from the cold. It would be bad for my old painful limbs. . . . I miss the
    many little acts of kindness you children were always doing for me."
    <br><br>After passing on an armful of local gossip (a Dr. Curtis "drove his
    whole family out the other night & beat his wife"), Elbert then reports on
    the family's pets which were left behind in Georgia: "I have got Sport & he
    is fat & contented with me & I love him for his Master’s sake. The cat I
    have not got." She doubts the quality of northern hired labor: "Your 'help'
    as you call her must look very smart in your nice kitchen with her nice
    apron & silk shawl, but do not think your victuals are any better cooked
    than I could do with my crippled foot & crokus apron. Anyhow, they do not
    love you better than I do & shall ever remember the kindness of you all to
    me. . . . From your old Moma, Catharine Elbert." <br><br>Elbert's
    correspondent is easy enough to trace. Martha Doolittle (1836-1906) was the
    daughter of Yankee flour merchant Alfred Doolittle. Martha and her siblings
    through 1848 were all born in Georgia, and then another girl was born in
    Massachusetts in 1850. The Doolittles are listed in the 1840 census with 3
    enslaved people, including one female aged 36-54. This all fits the
    narrative that Elbert could have served as Martha's caregiver for much of
    her childhood, and that Martha might have written to her shortly after
    moving to the north. <br><br>Our letter author Catherine Elbert may be the
    Catherine sold in 1812 along with her three children to a trustee of Harriet
    Ann Elbert, as cited in Tara D. Fields, "Human Bondage: The Buying and
    Selling of Africans in Camden County, Georgia," page 35. We cannot verify
    whether she had enough education to write this letter in her own hand.

    Manuscript letter to John Browning on one page, 9¾ x 7¾ inches; lacking

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Browning writes from Columbia, a fading Mississippi River town in
    southeastern Arkansas near the Louisiana and Mississippi lines (it was
    abandoned to river erosion in the 1870s). The letter is written in a tidy,
    educated hand, which would be remarkable for an enslaved person--or possibly
    the letter was written out at her request by her new owner. <br><br>The
    first part of the letter makes a simple request of her former owner John
    Browning: "My dear master, You will confer a favour on me by handing this
    letter to Mr. Levi Sykes and his sister Polly, and you will confer a favour
    on your old servant, Dinah Browning." <br><br>The remainder of the letter is
    addressed to "Mr. Levi Sikes & Miss Mary Sykes": "My dear master & mistress,
    I am now settled, also Daniel who is with me. I like the country very well,
    but have not had very good health. Neither has Daniel. We are on a cotton
    plantation in Arks., four miles above Columbia on the Mississippi River &
    belong to Samuel R. Walker. I would like that Miss Polly would see that Mr.
    Vincent Browning delivers over the things that I left with him to my son
    Lemick. You will please write me so soon as you receive this, address to the
    care of Mr. Samuel R. Walker. . . . Please say how my sister is, & my
    husband's brother, also all the balance of my acquaintances. I have had no
    trouble, only sickness. I have no room to complain of my living at all.
    Respectfully, Dinah Browning." <br><br>The persons named from her old life
    can all be found in the 1850 or 1860 census of Russell County, in the
    western part of Virginia. John Browning (1793-1878) was a fairly well-off
    planter, as was his son Vincent Browning (1821-1865). Levi Sykes (1807-1860)
    is listed in 1850 as a white farmer with no real estate; his son was a
    laborer. He was quite possibly an overseer or farmhand for the Brownings.
    His sister Polly Sykes (1812-1878) had a modest $1000 of property in the
    1860 census. The slave schedules for 1850 note 6 enslaved people in John
    Browning's possession, but just one adult--a 24-year-old mulatto woman,
    quite possibly Dinah. That matches with one of the 11 enslaved people listed
    for Samuel R. Walker in the 1860 census, a 35-year-old woman. We have been
    unable to trace Dinah Browning's life after emancipation.

    Wilson Chinn is depicted with instruments of torture used to punish enslaved
    people, including shackles, a nail-studded paddle, and a brutal spiked
    collar. This was part of a small series of disturbing images which were
    produced to raise funds, as stated on verso: "The nett proceeds from the
    sale of these Photographs will be devoted exclusively to the education of
    colored people in the Department of the Gulf, now under the command of Maj.
    Gen. Banks." <br><br>Wilson Chinn was born into slavery in Kentucky circa
    1803, and then sold as a young man to a particularly brutal sugar planter
    near New Orleans. Chinn and many of his compatriots were branded with the
    owner's "V.B.M." initials--some of them including Chinn on their foreheads.
    After the Union troops arrived, Chinn and several other New Orleans freedmen
    went north to help publicize the abolitionist cause. A group engraving with
    biographical information on Chinn appeared in Harper's Weekly on 30 January
    1864. <br><br>This is the less well-known image of Chinn wearing this
    collar; he also posed facing the camera in an image credited to Myron

    him short of cash, and the enslaved people were often hired out by the month
    or year, right through the final months of the Confederacy. <br><br>The
    collection contains at least 12 documents relating to enslaved people,
    including receipts for their sale, hire, or taxation from 1796 to 1860. A
    1858 receipt from Sidnum Grady, keeper of Richmond's Cary Street Jail, takes
    commission for the sale of "girl Mary Thomas" with deductions for 32 days
    board, "to having teeth cleaned 50 cents & soap 10 cents." In addition, a
    letter to Randolph from his mother in 1846 informs him: "The new overseer
    has done much for us in regard to the management of our servants. They keep
    pretty straight." <br><br>The collection also includes 16 letters dated
    1864-1865 to David C. Randolph from his nephew Isham Randolph Page
    (1834-1923), a Confederate surgeon based in Richmond who was helping to
    manage Randolph's business in the city. Most of the letters make some
    reference to Randolph's enslaved people: getting them hired out, collecting
    the fees, and tracking their movements as they moved back and forth to the
    city on the family's business. Most dramatically, a man named Aleck had been
    hired out to the Confederate Army. Page reports on 4 September 1864: "Alick
    came to me today complaining that he has been worked very hard & scarcely
    fed at all by gov't agent, to tell me that he was going home. I remonstrated
    with him at first, but he seemed so bent upon going to you, that I have
    determined to assist him in so doing. He says he is going if he has to walk,
    and in that event he would likely be taken up & it might give you some
    trouble to get him. . . . He says almost all the hands have gone off because
    they are driven so hard and fed so badly." On 16 April 1864 Page wrote about
    the increasing food shortage: "As far as my negroes go, I don't think the
    servants can have meat every day while people here & all over the country go
    without, & our servants will be obliged to take it every day now & none
    after a short time, or take little now and a little then." This lack of food
    was a common theme. A merchant wrote to Randolph in November 1863 to
    explain: "The reason why middlings and shoulders bring more than hams is
    that the former are wanted for negroes & working hands, with whom fat is a
    desideratum." <br><br>Edward Trent Page (1833-1906), brother of D.C.
    Coupland's wife Harriet Page Randolph, was a central subject of a detailed
    family history published in 2002, "A Way Out of No Way," by Dianne
    Swann-Wright (copy included). She was a descendant of the family enslaved by
    the Pages. Her book talks at length of her great-great-grandfather Jerry
    Wade (1833-1911), apparently the same Jerry Wade who was hired to work on
    D.C. Coupland's Buckingham plantation in December 1865, and paid $35 by a
    receipt in this collection. Edward T. Page also is named in a receipt dated
    31 March 1865 (days before the fall of the Confederacy) in which he sells
    400 pounds of bacon to Isham Randolph Page. Jerry is apparently also
    mentioned in a 4 December 1862 letter from William Nelson Page (1803-1883)
    to David C. Randolph: "I will thank you to do with man Jerry the best you
    can, just as you would do were he your own, and it will be entirely
    satisfactory to me." Two other enslaved men named in the book also appear in
    the archive, in a promissory note to pay Thomas West $300 "for the hire of
    two negro slaves named Henry Harris and Sam Johnson," Richmond, VA, 5
    January 1854. <br><br>This family archive has considerable interest even
    beyond the family's enslaved labor force. Three letters discuss the
    involvement of father Isham Randolph in the James River & Kanawha Company (a
    doomed canal project) in 1833 and 1835, one of them from Virginia governor
    John Floyd (1783-1837). An 1843 stock certificate from the company is
    included, as well as three illustrated certificates from the Farmers Bank of
    Virginia, 1854-1855. Several letters evoke the drama of the Confederate home
    front during the Civil War. David's sister Judith Randolph Swann (no
    relation) wrote from Mississippi in 1863 about her fear of the invading
    Yankees: "Of all humans they are the most detestable. Even the sight of one
    makes me shudder." Also included are a pair of inventories of captured
    supplies compiled by Confederate major Beverly Randolph, 20 July 1863 and
    undated. Just a month before the fall of Richmond, Isham Randolph Page wrote
    "The vile Yankees seem to be closing in on Rich'd in all directions where
    they don't expect to meet with armed men. . . . I fear from all I hear that
    Mann [Page] was captured by the Yankees this day. He left here only the day
    before in fine health & spirits. Carter & Bob were at Early's Hdqs & they
    too were also captured. Beverly Randolph (Col. Bev's son) was shot on the
    train of cars as it moved off from Greenwood & killed on the spot."

    Detailed accounting of a Maryland family's enslaved people who were "not

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    A slave-owner named Thomas Henry Hall (1744-1788) died young in Washington
    County, MD, leaving behind 5 young children. A trustee apparently managed
    the plantation, while ownership of some of the enslaved people was divided
    among the children. In 1802, with those children reaching or approaching
    adulthood, they started demanding a cash legacy from the estate. It was
    necessary to deduct the cost of their upbringing--and the expenses of
    "legacy slaves as were not worth their maintenance"--from the plantation's
    profits. Thus the cost of feeding the enslaved people with no economic value
    was counted in the same columns as feeding the master's orphan children who
    had no economic value. <br><br>For each of five Hall children, we have a
    year-by-year accounting from about 1788 to 1802. Each child is assessed a
    fee each year for "board, washing &c," clothing, the occasional doctor's
    bill, and (when old enough) tuition. They are also charged for slaves who
    were unable to work. For example, eldest son Thomas Jr. (born 1780) is
    charged about £5 each year for "maintenance of Sam" until Sam's
    disappearance in 1792. Eldest daughter Betsey (born 1781) is charged each
    year for "Maintenance of Ossen," with a midwife's fee added in 1789
    (presumably a miscarriage), another midwife's fee in 1792, and then the
    arrival of Jade on her rolls through 1796. Daughter Letitia (born 1787) was
    the owner of Jem & Milley until Jem disappeared in 1793 and Milley "went to
    Renches" in 1795. Daughter Hannah was charged for her own board only through
    30 April 1790, and then for her own burial expenses(!), but continued to be
    charged for the maintenance of Phillis, Monacy, John, Abram, and Frank at
    various points, including midwife's fees and smallpox inoculations.
    Similarly, youngest daughter Barbara was charged for her own "nursing,
    funeral expenses in the year 1791" but her infant estate continued to be
    liable for her enslaved people: Jenny's doctor bill in 1794, Maria's
    maintenance from 1797-1799 ending with a midwife's fee and her
    disappearance, followed by the arrival of Eliza in 1800. If we understand
    this properly, Eliza was born into slavery in 1799 to a mother who died in
    childbirth, and was owned by the estate of a baby girl who had been dead for
    eight years. The accounting concludes with "maintenance of such of the
    common stock of slaves as were not worth their maintenance." These enslaved
    people were apparently property of the estate and not given to individual
    children. This introduces us to Old Lucy, Peter (died in January 1791),
    William, Ned, Joe, Charles, Bob, Robert, the younger Lucy, and Jim.
    <br><br>The final page includes a brief note explaining this unusual
    account. It was assembled by order of the Orphan's Court, and this was a
    personal copy of the official report. The man tasked with this work was a
    local land speculator and slave trader from Hagerstown, MD named Colonel
    Nathaniel Rochester. He later relocated to western New York in 1810, and
    soon founded the city which bears his name. The handwriting in this account
    matches that in his slave-trading accounts, as published in the 2009
    Rochester History article "'We Called Her Anna': Nathaniel Rochester and
    Slavery in the Genesee Country."

    Memorandum book tracking many dozens of enslaved people at a Mississippi
    plantation.
  at-a-glance: '[Near Natchez, MS], 1824-1838'
  TYPESET: >-
    23 manuscript pages. 4to, original ¼ calf, worn with front board and first
    leaf detached, with original title on front board "Memorandum Book for
    Estate of Wm. R. Smith, 1825"; minor wear and foxing to contents.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This volume was kept by an unknown manager for the estates of William Rufus
    Smith (1796-1824) and his father Philander Smith (1765-1824) near Natchez,
    Mississippi. Green Horse Plantation and Mantua Plantation are named, but
    they may have held additional properties. The volume is divided into two
    basic sections. First is a memorandum book in diary form which runs from 22
    November 1824 to April 1828, pages 1-8. This is followed by lists of the
    enslaved people on the estate, begun in 1824 and updated through 1837, on
    pages 13-17 and 23-32. <br><br>The diary portion begins: "Took charge of the
    plantation belonging to the estate of Wm. R. Smith & Phil'r Smith dec'd. Not
    pleased with the overseer Mr. Day" (22 November 1824). Day was quickly
    replaced, and on 15 December, 97 bales of cotton were hauled into town for
    transport to New Orleans. In 1825 the manager transcribed an old list of 25
    enslaved people and their values from 1822, and settled the values of 10
    named enslaved people for the estate. In 1826 he notes "gin ready to run 1st
    September, built by Ashford." His final narrative entry was in 1828: "Girl
    named Polly purch'd . . . had a child 20th April." <br><br>The later entries
    record the enslaved population more systematically--and, unusually for the
    time, they are arranged by family. The record was drafted in 1825, and
    updated regularly. One family started with just Spencer aged 37, Big Harriet
    aged 27, and Amos aged 5. Over the years from 1826 to 1832, 4 more children
    were added to the family, with their birthdates, with one dying as an
    infant. Several marriages and re-marriages are recorded. A woman named Fanny
    aged 55 is listed as "died May 1827, fell in the fire in a fit." Several
    others were purchased on behalf of Smith's minor children and added to the
    estate in 1828, and the volume concludes with an 8-page "list of Negroes on
    Mantua Plantation, 1834, belonging to the heirs of W.R. Smith dec'd as
    divided March 31st 1834." This final list is updated through a girl born in
    1838. More than 200 enslaved people are listed in this section in total,
    although some of them may be duplicated. At the very least, it is an
    extremely valuable genealogical resource.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    "I have whiped nearly all of them."<br><br>John David Ray (1841-1911) was
    the son of a wealthy attorney and planter in Newnan, GA. This letter
    suggests that he was rarely entrusted with the overseeing of the family
    slaves, perhaps because he enjoyed it too much. He writes to his brother
    Lavender Robinson Ray (1842-1916), then off to college, who became a
    Confederate officer and politician; some of his papers are at the Atlanta
    History Center. <br><br>John apparently made the decision to run off an
    overseer named Culbreath for raping an enslaved woman (the 1860 census does
    show an overseer named Francis Culbreath, aged 40, in Newnan): "I am at the
    plantation now overseeing. I commence picking cotton this week. I have out
    about 15 bales. . . . I have had several difficultys with the Culbrut men
    since you left here. One was I cort one of the men serving Ane one night. I
    ord him to stan or I would shoot him. He would not stan, so I fired at him,
    but did not hit him, and I snap the other barrel at him. It did not go off.
    If it had, I would have killed him dead. The Culbrut is hom now and I am
    glad of it." <br><br>Ray then boasts of his own exploits as an overseer:
    "All the negroes talk about you. They say you are a great deal better to
    them than I am. I have whiped nearly all of them sinse I have ben here. I
    whiped William & Candus about stealing wheat. Randle run away when I cald
    him up to whip him, but he came back & told me he did rong, an would not do
    so eney more." <br><br>John closes with a friendly postscript to his
    brother: "All the Negroes send howdy to you, and said you must keep you
    prick in your briches. I think it is good advise."

    John Fitzgerald emigrated from Ireland to Alexandria, VA in 1769. He soon
    established himself as a successful merchant in the partnership of
    Fitzgerald & Peers, and a friend of George Washington. During the American
    Revolution, he served as aide-de-camp under Washington from 1776 to 1778,
    rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel before leaving the service due to
    wounds suffered at the Battle of Monmouth. In April 1781, with British
    forces poised to invade and burn Alexandria, Fitzgerald gathered a small
    force of local citizens which was able to ward them off. <br><br>Fitzgerald
    was also a slave-owner. This bill of sale is dated during the Revolution,
    just a month after his victory in Alexandria. His business partner Valentine
    Peers deeds him "a mulatto man carpenter named Frank and a negro man
    Charles, as purchased by the partnership of Fitzgerald & Peers" for £120 in
    Virginia currency. <br><br>Fitzgerald later served as a mayor of Alexandria
    and is considered one of the town's founding fathers. He died in December
    1799, the same month as his famous ex-presidential friend. In 2018, a
    waterfront park in Alexandria was planned to be named in Fitzgerald's honor,
    but the plan was dropped because of his slave-owning past.

    In Solomon Northrup's famous narrative Twelve Years a Slave (see lot 5) and
    in the recent film adaptation, Theophilus Freeman (circa 1806-1855) played a
    central role. In 1841, shortly after Northrup's capture into slavery in
    Washington, he was sent down to a New Orleans slave market run by Freeman,
    who sold him under a false name. Offered here is a notarized copy of another
    slave deed executed by the same Freeman, dated less than three years
    earlier. <br><br>This document records the sale by Freeman to Merritt
    Grandison Kemp of St. Helena, LA "the following slaves, to wit: William
    Rolling, a negro man, aged about twenty years, valued at the sum of one
    thousand dollars, and Dennis Ward, a negro man, aged about nineteen years,
    valued at the sum of twelve hundred dollars, both recently imported into
    this state and lawfully owned by the said vendor." <br><br>It may be
    impossible to know whether William Rolling and Dennis Ward were legally
    sold, or if they had been captured as Solomon Northrup had been. Certainly,
    the statement "both recently imported into this state" is an ominous sign.
    We have been unable to trace the fates of either men. The purchaser Merritt
    G. Kemp (1816-1863) was a young man at the time, only 22 years old. He
    remained in St. Helena until his death in 1863, but did not still own any
    men of the appropriate age in the 1860 census.

    Thomas David Smith McDowell (1823-1898) was the eldest son of a wealthy
    planter father who had died the previous July. As shown in this letter, his
    first goal was to turn some of that inheritance into ready cash, by selling
    Harry, an enslaved man who could "do as much work as any negro I ever saw."
    What did that hard unpaid labor get Harry? Not a "thank you," but rather a
    surprise sale to another owner during a trip into town: "I would rather he
    would not know that I intend selling him." In full: <br><br>"I started my
    man Harry in Thos. J. Norman's raft a few days since, and he will probably
    be in Wilmington within a day or two. I have come to the conclusion to sell
    him if I can obtain a reasonable price for him, and wish you to attend to
    his sale for me. If you can get five hundred dollars, you can take it,
    nothing less than that sum, and as much more as you can, for I verily
    believe he is worth considerable more than that amt to any one who has an
    overseer. I need say nothing respecting his qualities as you are acquainted
    with him, being sound and healthy and able to do as much work as any negro I

  CROSSHEAD: Letter investigating a suspicious Alabama slave trader.

  TYPESET: >-
    Autograph Letter Signed from T.H. Anderson to Henry Anderson. 3 pages, 10 x
    8 inches, on one folding sheet; minor wear.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This letter is literally full of more questions than answers. A Georgia
    slave owner named T.H. Anderson apparently hired one J.M. Askew to help
    transport a large number of enslaved people to Alabama, and became
    suspicious that Askew had somehow swindled him. Here he asks a lawyer to
    investigate the entire transaction thoroughly: "What negrows were purchased
    with the money that said Askew was to have his wages out of? What negrows
    did I have on hand when I employed Askew? Name the negrows bought and on
    hand? . . . Was any negrows brought out to sell on commissions? . . . The
    boy Tom, where was he purchased? Was he not brought to Alabamia while Askew
    was in the prison bounds in the town of Covington? . . . Was I to have the
    liberty to discharg said Askew whenever he spent one dime without my
    consent? . . . Do you no how many trips Askew made with me, and where did I
    meet him? The last trip, how many negrows had I on hand when he met me, and
    where did we meet?" <br><br>Then Anderson has the clever idea to ask the
    enslaved people to testify on the terms of the purchase: "Do you no Ginny
    and Alfred and Jes state whether thay were sold on commission or bought by
    me to sell on ac't Askew?" Here he notes "Sold for Goss & Turner and
    myself." He continues: "Do you no the negrows brought out to Alabamia of
    Bess H. Waren's? If so, state what terms thay were brought out? . . . .
    State whether I had other means imployed in the trade than the 2222 dollars?
    . . . . What is the usial expences on a negrow from Georgia to Alabamia when
    carryed by privet convayance, and what by public conveyance?"

    carriage Driver and somewhat of a Plasterer." Some of them are described
    with enough detail that they might be possibly traced through to freedom,
    which came to New Orleans just four years later. <br><br>The auctioneers N.
    Vignie and R.W. Long are named, but not the consignors. The preview was held

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This firm had offices at 57 Magazine Street and 866 Levee Street. John G.
    Mackey (1825-1873) and Lemuel Purnell Day (1829-1932) advertised themselves
    as "Auctioneers, Commission & Forwarding Merchants, will pay strict
    attention to the purchase and sale of Real Estate, Negroes, Horses, Mules,
    Carriages, and every description of Merchandise." <br><br>The card is
    undated. Mackey was a partner in other auction firms from 1859 onward. By 9
    February 1861, he was in operation at these two addresses as a sole
    proprietor, when he advertised in the New Orleans Crescent for the upcoming
    auction of "Daniel, a likely negro fellow, about 30 years old; a good house
    servant, coachman, and ostler" and "Abraham, a good whitewasher and
    plasterer." The partnership of Mackey & Day began soon after, and advertised
    from these addresses in the New Orleans Daily Crescent from 28 February to 6
    May 1861. The 5 June 1861 issue of the Daily Delta advertised the 57
    Magazine location for rent, "lately occupied by Mackey & Day." Mackey later
    served as a captain in the Confederate army, while Day served as a
    lieutenant in the Crescent City Guards militia unit. The arrival of Union
    troops in May 1862 brought an end to the slave trade in New Orleans. This
    card was found in a scrapbook kept by a Union soldier during the Civil
    War.

    Filling most of the first page and extending slightly into the second is "An
    Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery" which had been proposed for debate
    by the state's General Assembly, in addition to the small distraction of the
    ongoing Revolution. It passed into law the following March. Its scope was
    limited: those presently in slavery were to remain so for life. However, all
    children of slaves born in Pennsylvania going forward were to be considered
    indentured servants who would be free at age 28; enslaved people imported
    into the state would be declared free; and slaveowners were required to keep
    a detailed register to assure compliance. This was the first law ever passed
    by a democracy which abolished slavery. <br><br>The law was not yet in
    effect. On page 3, we find the kind of advertisement which was all too
    common in newspapers of this era: "To be sold: a very likely active Negro
    boy, about fifteen years of age; he has had the small pox and measles,
    understands talking care of horses, and rides well."

    "He wept freely, but stated that it was not for himself those tears were
    shed." <br><br>In 1837, the abolitionist editor Elijah Parish Lovejoy began
    publishing the Alton Observer in Alton, Illinois, just across the river from
    slave-holding Missouri. On 7 November 1837, a pro-slavery mob stormed the
    warehouse where he printed the newspaper, killed Lovejoy, and threw his
    press into the river. His martyrdom was a seminal moment in the history of
    the abolition movement. Most notably, an obscure struggling entrepreneur
    named John Brown heard the news and announced "Here, before God, in the
    presence of these witnesses, from this time, I consecrate my life to the
    destruction of slavery!" Offered here is a contemporary first-hand account
    of the days leading up to Lovejoy's death, written by a sympathetic visitor
    to Alton. <br><br>The letter's author Elizabeth Ambrose Merrill (1810-1868)
    was from New Hampshire, and went west as a missionary to the Choctaws in
    Eagletown, OK in 1835, accompanying the Rev. Cyrus Byington (who is
    mentioned at the end of this letter). She wrote to her friend Anna Burnham
    (1778-1847), a fellow missionary at Fort Towson a few miles west of
    Eagleton, who had been working with the Choctaws since the 1820s. Both women
    are listed as assistant missionaries to the Choctaws in the 1840 book
    "History of American Missions to the Heathen," page 340. <br><br>Merrill
    wrote this letter in 5 installments over a two-week period. It begins with
    her account of a trip eastward through Little Rock, AR to the Mississippi
    River, down to St. Louis, and then reaching Alton on 19 October, where she
    hopes to teach school. There she boards with J.C. Wood, who would be one of
    the final defenders of the Lovejoy press. <br><br>On 30 October she reports
    hearing a sermon by the Rev. Edward Beecher, the brother of Harriet Beecher
    Stowe and a close friend of Rev. Lovejoy's: "It was what is termed an
    abolitionist sermon. . . . I find there is a great excitement in the city.
    Another press is expected & the anti-abolitionists have expressly declared
    that they will destroy it, if it costs life." <br><br>The next day she
    reports "Things seem to be assuming a fearful aspect. Last eve Mr. Beecher
    was called to preach the sermon he delivered sab[bath] morn again. A mob
    collected, stones thrown in at the window &c. We know not what the result
    will be. All abroad seems to be misrule, turmoil & confusion. Wars & rumors
    of wars. Mr. Woods attended the meeting. Mrs. W. & myself c'ld distinctly
    hear the confusion."<br><br>In a postscript, Merrill describes the events of
    the following days: "A public meeting was held last Thursday & Friday for
    the purpose, if possible, to conciliate & compromise. Both parties met. Mr.
    Lovejoy made a long & affecting speech. He wept freely, but stated that it
    was not for himself those tears were shed. He felt a consciousness that he
    was in the path of duty. The thought of my wife & child, said he, causes my
    heart to bleed. After the meeting on Tuesday eve., a mob collected at his
    house before his return & demanded admittance. Mr. L. found his wife in the
    garret filled with terror." <br><br>On the day of the mob attack, 7
    November, Merrill wrote: "The fearful tale is told. Who, oh who, can
    describe the scene of last night? But I must hasten to give you some idea.
    Mr. Woods was requested to go to Mr. Gilman's warehouse, after supper, to
    assist in keeping the press fr. being destroyed. (It reached here Mon.). He
    went, & with others prepared to spend the night in the building. About 11,
    the mob collected around the doors, & demanded admittance. This was refused.
    Guns were fired by both parties & several wounded. The mob seemed for a time
    to disperse, but soon returned with a reinforcement & a ladder. They
    ascended the building, & set fire to the roof. What must have been the
    feelings of those on the inside at this juncture: the building on fire & the
    rioters ready to take their life as they left. I cannot describe the whole,
    suffice it to say that two were killed: Mr. Lovejoy, editor & one of the
    other party, & 7 wounded. Mr. Gilman gave up his building, requesting them
    to take the press & extinguish the fire. The press was thrown in the river.
    Mr. Woods returned a little past 1. You will suppose that Mrs. W. & myself
    had slept little. The bell was rung after Mr. L. was shot, & we knew that
    someone was dead. But this is not all. This dreadful spirit still prevails.
    Today these murderers have been exulting in their success & have uttered
    fearful threats against every abolitionist in the place. Mr. Graves has been
    particularly threatened. Oh, what will this come to! Who can tell the
    feelings of poor Mrs. Lovejoy?" <br><br>Merrill added one final addendum the
    day after the riot, writing crosswise on the first page to add: "As soon as
    the mob got possession of the press they extinguished the fire. Little
    damage was done to the building. Yesterday Dr. Bell was heard to say. 'I
    c'ld shoot down every abolitionist in town'. Oh, where will it
    end?"<br><br>Printed accounts of Lovejoy's murder swept across the country
    in the following months, but we have traced no manuscripts at auction
    relating to these fateful events, and certainly none with this high level of
    emotion and detail.

    Autograph Letter Signed from Austin F. Williams to wife Jennette Cowles
    Williams in Farmington, CT, on printed letterhead "Engraved by P. Reason, a

    plus address panel on final blank bearing New York postmark; mailing folds,

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This engraving was produced by Patrick Henry Reason (1816-1892) of New York,
    an early Black engraver. The image went on to be used frequently by the
    American Anti-Slavery Society, including in the 1836 book "The Fountain for
    Every Day in the Year," and sometimes appeared with the caption "Am I Not a
    Woman and a Sister." <br><br>This letterhead was used by Austin Franklin
    Williams (1805-1885), a leading white abolitionist from Farmington, CT who
    made his home a stop on the Underground Railroad, helped form the defense
    committee for the Amistad captives in 1839, and then built a house for the
    freed male captives where they resided until their return to Africa in 1841.
    <br><br>This letter was written before the Amistad case, but Williams was
    already deeply involved in the abolitionist cause. Around Reason's
    engraving, he has written "Remember those that are in bond, as bound with
    them." The letter contains mostly family news, and also discusses a legal
    case which may or may not be abolition-related: "You say the young men had a
    time of rejoicing. Who were acquitted? I heard by Ch. that 5, but have not
    seen the names. As for what the lawyers and our F[armingto]n friends! say
    about my testimony, I care not one straw about it. I am glad, however, that
    some of the good people saw as I did, but what I did see I know for a
    certain. One thing I have for my comfort, my conscience is quiet as I wish
    it to being on that subject."

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This letter was written from Denmark in the southeastern corner of Iowa,
    perhaps 25 miles from the Missouri line. The town was an active stop on the
    underground railroad; its cemetery was recently named to the National
    Underground Railroad Network to Freedom in recognition of the activists
    buried there. This letter by a Denmark resident acknowledges the regular
    presence of the fugitives in his town, although he seems to be a hostile
    witness: "If a nigger comes to this place he gets on to the under ground
    rail road mighty sudden, and the next thing he knows he is in Canada
    freezing to death, and I expect that is the only way to abolish slavery in
    the south: run them into Canada and freeze them to death." <br><br>The
    letter writer, George Clinton Hawkins (1835-1898), explained his politics
    earlier in the letter, viewing himself as a rare Buchanan supporter in a sea
    of abolitionists: "Everybody votes the Republican ticket but me and one
    other fellow. I went for old Buck and he for Filmere."

    Illustrated leaflet, 5 x 3 inches, plus integral blank; minor wear and

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This piece defies proper explanation--but it is rare and intriguing. The
    woodcut illustration seems to depict a fugitive slave being attacked by
    dogs. The text reads in full: "Black Status. William Tillman, Robert Small,
    Loyal-Hercules at the Capitol, taking care of 'live friends of the 'Fugitive
    Law of 1850.'" It seems to date from the time of the Civil War. Tillman and
    Small had similar stories, both of them being Black men who commandeered
    Confederate vessels (in 1861 and 1862 respectively), and led them to safety
    in the North. Tillman fell back into obscurity after his heroics, but Small
    played an important role in convincing Lincoln to create Black regiments for
    the war effort, served in the Union Navy, and after the war embarked on a
    successful career in politics. This piece seems to celebrate his escape from
    slavery to help defeat the old "friends of the Fugitive Slave Act."
    <br><br>The added pencil text reads "July 9, 1845/Peter M. Garner/Crayton
    Loraine/Mordecai Thomas/Jan 10, 1846." This relates to three Underground
    Railroad supporters who were arrested on the Ohio shore and extradited to
    Virginia, where they were charged with aiding slaves to escape. How this
    connects to the printed caption is unclear, as the case took place 16 years
    before Robert Small rose to prominence. In short, this piece is apparently
    unique, and something of a mystery to us. Some smart person out there will
    have an explanation--and we look forward to hearing it!

    One of the most iconic images of slavery. After repeated beating and
    whippings at a Louisiana plantation, Gordon escaped from slavery and made
    his way to a Union camp at Baton Rouge, where he joined the army as a
    private. A camp photographer took a series of photographs which graphically
    demonstrated the brutality he had endured. The present photograph was the
    best known. It was engraved for the 4 July 1863 issue of Harper's Weekly,
    where it ran over the caption "Gordon Under Medical Inspection." This
    example is on the original photographers' mount.

    Detailed inventory of almost 200 enslaved people on three Jamaica sugar

  TYPESET: >-
    8 manuscript pages, 13 x 8 inches, on 2 folding sheets; short separations at
    folds.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    An extremely detailed listing of enslaved people owned by the heirs of
    Jamaica sugar planter James Irving (1713-1775), as divided between three
    plantations and four of his grandchildren. Irving acquired the Ironshore and
    Hartfield plantations in 1755, and the Irving Tower plantation in 1759. By
    1832, he had been dead for several decades, but his descendants (scattered
    across the globe) were still enjoying the profits. Here are listed
    approximately 180 of the enslaved inhabitants of the plantations, with their
    "old names," "Christian names," occupations, "condition," age, value as of
    1831 and 1832, and yards of cloth allotted. <br><br>For example, Caesar at
    the Ironshore plantation was renamed William Green. He was aged 34, a
    "driver to grass cutter," and his value had depreciated from £80 to £60 over
    the past year. The occupations are wide-ranging: "1st gang," watchman,
    "exempt having 6 children," "3rd gang cook," "cattle boy," "head boiler,"
    etc. Most are "able" or "healthy," or "weakly," with one "idiot," one blind,
    one "venereal," and several small children "weaning." Most intriguing is
    Cassius of the 1st gang, aged 52, who is recorded as "absent during the
    rebellion & since." This likely refers to the recent Baptist War or
    Christmas Rebellion, in which several hundred enslaved people were killed or
    executed, and many others escaped to freedom in the island's interior.
    Within each plantation, the enslaved people are organized by the cousin who
    had inherited them: Jacob Aemilius Irving (1797-1858) of Ontario, Canada;
    Lucy Ann Irving (1806-1848) and her mother Susanna; James Irving III
    (1792-1857); and John Serocold Jackson (1777-1850) of Australia. Each
    grouping is given an appraisal; as the appraiser signatures are all in the
    same hand, this must be a contemporary transcript. It offers a vivid
    portrait of plantation life, rendered even more dramatic by the mention of a
    man who escaped during the recent revolt.

    Autograph Letter Signed to the president and board of the New Jersey

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Henry W. Johnson, Jr. (circa 1822-1884) of Canandaigua, NY rose in his
    working life from barber to lawyer. In June 1865, discouraged by his
    prospects in America, he emigrated to Liberia with the help of the New
    Jersey Colonization Society. This letter was sent as a report back to his
    sponsors. "All that has transpired since I left America, and all I have
    witnessed since my arrival here, have only confirmed me in the belief that
    Africa is the best home for the oppressed Black men of America! While in
    America, I was constantly weighed down with the thought that I was
    constantly in the presence of those who considered me inferior to them, for
    no other reason than because I wear the dark skin given me by my creator. .
    . . I have felt as free as the air we breathe, and the ponderous weight of
    human bondage has rolled off from my soul. My citizenship is acknowledged,
    my rights respected, my wrongs redressed, and my manhood fully recognized!
    This is what Liberia will do for every black man. . . . How lamentable it
    is, that so many thousands of intelligent colored men in America, possessing
    fine tallents and ample means, will continue to hug their chains, kiss the
    rod that smites them, finally die in despair . . . when they can obtain all
    they desire within the limits of the Republic of Liberia!" He also
    condescendingly describes the pre-colonization inhabitants of Liberia as
    "ignorant, degraded, superstitious, wild, and hostile tribes of natives" who
    have since been improved by "the seeds of a Christian civilization."
    <br><br>The bulk of this letter was published under the title "Views of an
    Intelligent Emigrant" in the journal African Repository, May 1866, pages
    149-152. Two substantial passages from the letter were left out from the
    published version, though--both of them being passages which reflected
    poorly on the situation in Liberia: "Upon our arrival, we found the people
    suffering some inconvenience from a scarcity of provisions caused by an
    interruption of trade, in consequence of the Annunciation. The arrival of
    the Thomas Pope was very opportune, and Capt. Alexander was hailed as a
    great deliverer!" Also left out of the published account was a postscript:
    "My family and myself are still under the influence of a fever. Therefore I
    have seen but little, and can say no more at present. In my next, I will
    speak of the government and people, and . . . endeavor to give such
    information as will be interesting, useful and instructive to the American
    people." Certainly, the editors did not want to create an impression that
    emigrants would be greeted by starvation and disease. Also notable is a
    one-word change which may be incidental, or may be somewhat disturbing.
    Johnson signed this original letter as "Your humble friend." It was set into
    type in the African Repository as "Your humble servant." <br>Johnson went on
    to serve as Attorney General of Liberia from 1869 to 1871, was ousted in a
    coup, and ran a coffee plantation there until his death in 1884. A two-part
    article on him by Preston E. Pierce, "Liberian Dreams, West African
    Nightmare: The Life of Henry W. Johnson," ran in the journal Rochester
    History in 2004 and 2005.

    kingdom in what is now the Republic of Congo. He later helped draw attention
    to atrocities in the colony committed by the Belgian king Leopold II. Over a

    consciousness of our masses moves ever faster. Military regimes are actually
    finished in Africa. . . . The masses now want only one thing, an honest
    leader. . . . This alone is a serious blow to neo-colonialism which . . .
    can only depend on sustained corruption. . . . The neglect of the immaterial
    force . . . among Africans who as a mass are very religious, caused
    hesitation in accepting Marxism-Leninism from my youth. This in fact is what
    led me to Nkrumatism-Tureism, showing that each people must have their own
    ideology. . . . Africa gave birth to Judaism, stabilized Christianity, saved
    Islam from destruction!" He closes with a wish for "One unified socialist

    artist Mrs. Emma Clary Webb Peoples (1878-1956) was the daughter of a
    Nashville grocer, and married the head of a Tennessee boarding school. They
    moved to Asheville, NC in the late 1920s, and remained there through at
    least 1943. She was generally known as Mrs. Clary Webb Peoples. She
    submitted photographs to the Nashville Banner as early as 1921, and her
    watercolors were exhibited in Asheville, NC in 1928 (Asheville Citizen, 3
    April 1928). She exhibited 16 of her "water color studies of negro types" in
    Meadville, PA in 1944; "The Campus of Allegheny College" newspaper of 2
    November 1944 noted "Sketching negroes has been a lifetime hobby of Mrs.
    Peoples, and she is still pursuing it." Her daughter Clary Webb Peoples
    Bowen (1913-1991) was a fine arts major at Duke, but married in June 1938;
    she was not the artist behind these watercolors. <br><br>Provenance:

    Ink and pencil on stiff paper, tinted with screentone overlays, and printed

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Thaddeus "Ted" Shearer (1919-1992) was born in Jamaica and raised in Harlem.
    After meeting the established artist E. Simms Campbell (see lot 239) in high
    school, he went on to a long career as an artist and art director. His
    one-panel "Next Door" comic launched in syndication to the Black press in
    1942, appearing in the Pittsburgh Courier and elsewhere. He is best known
    for his daily strip Quincy, featuring the adventures of a young Harlem boy
    and his friends, which had national syndication from 1970 to 1986.
    <br><br>Offered here are 4 of his "Next Door" panels, and 3 "Quincy" strips.
    The "Next Door" panels are each about 11 x 8 inches. They appear to date
    from the early 1960s, probably for publication in the New York Amsterdam
    News--they do not match the style of his most widely syndicated 1940s work,
    but look quite a bit like his Quincy strips from the 1970s. One strip makes
    a reference to "1962 pennies," and another is a fundraising appeal for the
    Amsterdam News Camp Fund which predates the 1963 introduction of zip codes.
    Two feature a hapless middle-aged character named Mr. Puddinhead, while
    another (the Camp Fund appeal) features the unmistakable future star "Lil'
    Quincy." <br><br>The three Quincy strips, each about 6 x 17 inches, are
    easier to place. They bear printed King Features Syndicate copyright slips
    and are dated in manuscript, 30 March 1971 (but with an inked stamp reading
    26 February 1971 on verso), 3 August 1972, and 30 June 1973. In the 1971
    strip, Quincy's young friend is bound for the planetarium and hopes that the
    stars on the ceiling will include Sidney Poitier and Flip Wilson. The 1972
    strip (illustrated) shows Quincy and his friends luxuriating in an open fire
    hydrant.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Banneker's scarce first almanac. It begins with an endorsement by James
    McHenry, one of the signers of the Constitution: "Benjamin Banneker, a free
    Negro, has calculated an Almanack, for the ensuing year. . . . His father
    was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. . . .
    Whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and
    peculiarly his own. . . . I consider this Negro as a fresh proof that the
    powers of the mind are disconnected with the colour of the skin. . . . I
    cannot but wish, on this occasion, to see the Public patronage keep pace
    with my black friend's merit." The editors add an additional note of support
    to introduce "an extraordinary Effort of Genius . . . calculated by a sable
    Descendant of Africa . . . controverting the long-established illiberal
    Prejudice against the Blacks." <br><br>Among the important dates noted in
    Banneker's almanac are Washington's birthday. Among the bits of information
    and wisdom which precede and follow the calendar portion, a note on page 5
    reads "Needles first made in London, by a Negro, from Spain, in the reign of
    Q. Mary." Banneker sent the manuscript of this first almanac to Secretary of
    State Thomas Jefferson, which began a famous correspondence. <br><br>The
    title page appears in two states; this is apparently the second state with
    the author's name corrected from "Banniker." No others traced at auction

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    African-American scientist Benjamin Banneker (1731-1806) is best known today
    for the annual almanacs he published in Baltimore. In an effort to promote
    his first almanac, he sent a draft to Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson,
    also a man of science, and received a thoughtful response. Their exchange
    was published in the Virginia Gazette, and is here reprinted on pages
    222-224. Banneker starts by noting "the almost general prejudice and
    prepossession which is so prevalent in the world against those of my
    complexion. . . . We are a race of beings who have long labored under the
    abuse and censure of the world." He compares his race's quest for freedom to
    the efforts Jefferson and other patriots made during the recent Revolution,
    and concludes by sending a manuscript of his astronomical calculations "that
    you might also view it in my own hand-writing." <br><br>Jefferson's response
    is short but at least somewhat sincere: "Nobody wishes more than I do, to
    see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren,
    talents equal to those of the other colours of men; and that the appearance
    of the want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their
    existence, both in Africa and America." He hopes for the means to educate
    African-Americans "as fast as the imbecility of their present existence, and
    other circumstances which cannot be neglected, will admit." He calls
    Banneker's almanac "a document to which your whole colour had a right, for
    their justification against the sentiments which have been entertained of
    them." Later in the magazine are Jefferson's "Remarks on the Constitution of
    the United States."

    The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was formed in Oakland, CA in
    October 1966, and gained local attention for its armed police-monitoring
    patrols. The California legislature, spooked by this activity, drafted
    legislation to forbid carrying loaded weapons in public. On 2 May 1967, a
    large group of armed Black Panthers arrived at the State Capitol in
    Sacramento to protest the restriction of their rights. This, more than any
    other single event, brought the Panthers national attention. These three
    photographs helped tell the story. <br><br>Original photograph, 7 x 9

    These photographs were taken at the scene just eight days after the killing
    of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark by the Chicago police and FBI. Most show
    bullet-pocked doors and walls of the Panther headquarters. One shows several
    copies of a Black Panther "Statement to the Black Community" scattered on
    the floor, and in another, a stack of Black Panther Community News Service
    issues is stacked atop a folded mattress. One wall is covered with newspaper
    clippings about the Panthers' earlier gun battle with the police. One photo
    shows a scale model of the apartment set up in the state attorney's office,
    and another shows the apartment's exterior rear exit. <br><br>These images
    were taken by Chicago Tribune photographers, mostly longtime staffer James
    O'Leary, and apparently come from that paper's morgue. 4 of them have
    Tribune clippings affixed on verso to show where the photographs were

    On 13 January 1970, three Black inmates at Soledad Prison were shot by a
    prison guard for engaging in a fist-fight. The ensuing investigation
    exonerated the guard; within an hour, another white prison guard was killed
    in retaliation. Prisoners George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo and John Clutchette
    were charged with the murder. Their defense quickly became a popular cause
    in activist circles; this poster featured a quote from Ho Chi Minh's prison
    diary. Jackson was killed in a breakout attempt on 21 August 1971, shortly
    before his trial; he left his modest estate to the Black Panther Party.
    Drumgo and Clutchette were acquitted the following year.

    The Black Liberation Army was an underground revolutionary organization with

    at least 1970 to 1981. As described in these police bulletins, "subjects are
    followers of Eldridge Cleaver and are . . . dedicated to killing police
    officers, attacking police stations, and the armed robberies of lending
    institutions." 64 members are listed, of whom 15 had active arrest warrants
    and 6 were already in custody. Photographs of each (mostly mug shots) follow
    the lists. Joanne Chesimard (Assata Shakur) is listed as "wanted" in the

    An organizational chart of the newly formed Black nationalist group Republic
    of New Africa, prepared by the F.B.I. as part of a federal report on riots
    and civil disorders. The group asserted that Louisiana, Mississippi,
    Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina were subjugated territory to be
    liberated. The group's founding president Robert F. Williams is shown, and
    his eventual successor Richard Henry (Imari Obadele) is named as head of the
    midwest region. Betty Shabazz, widow of Malcolm X, is shown as a former vice
    president. Two major figures not commonly associated with the group are
    named as Ministers of Culture: Leroi Jones (Amiri Baraka), and Maulana
    Karenga (the creator of Kwanzaa and head of US Organization). Minister of
    Health & Welfare Audley Moore (Queen Mother Moore) was born in 1898 and
    provided a link to the earlier work of Marcus Garvey.

    Circular letter signed by Rella Brown of the Harriet Tubman Prison Movement,
    addressed to "Comrades," explaining her split with the Black Workers
    Congress, discussing "their class nature and outlook being very
    petty-bourgeois. . . . We have seen a split between Malcolm X and the
    Muslims, Eldridge from Huey and Mao-Tse-Tung from Lin Pio, and the same
    phenomenon applies to revolutionary organizations . . . but my revolutionary
    commitment will never resign. I will continue speaking engagements, studying
    intensely and will develop a strong base for the defeat of the Bourgeois."

    Redbird, OK was one of dozens of all-Black towns which sprung up in Oklahoma
    in the wake of the 1889 land rush. It is one of a handful which survives
    today. An agricultural community, its population peaked at 336 in 1920.
    <br><br>Iverson W. Lane (circa 1867-1952) came to Redbird in 1908, but in
    1934 was denied the right to vote. His case went all the way to the Supreme
    Court, which struck down Oklahoma's discriminatory voting law in Lane v.
    Wilson. He and Solomon B. "Saub" Bradley were partners in two cotton gins, a
    grain elevator, and a general store. Here we see about a dozen workers and
    customers at the gin, most or all of them apparently Black, with bales of
    cotton awaiting processing.

    give to their customers with each purchase. The loyal customers were then
    able to redeem a full album of 1200 stamps for a $3.00 discount. The blank

    they cannot move America only by praying, demonstrating, sitting-in, and in
    the courts. Therefore, they are now focusing their attention on economics
    and politics." According to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, head of Operation

    Eleanor Roosevelt pressed for anti-lynching legislation during the

    member of the NAACP, and joined its board of directors in 1945. In that
    capacity, she came to know the head of its Legal Defense Fund, Thurgood
    Marshall. This letter was written in response to his birthday greeting:
    "Thanks so much for your very thoughtful message which I received on the
    occasion of my seventieth birthday. Your good wishes added greatly to the
    event, and I was happy to hear from you." Provenance: William Cole, stepson

    Letter Signed as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to Thurgood
    Marshall. 3 typed pages, 10½ x 7¾ inches; mailing folds, two punch holes in

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This letter was written in the context of the Emmett Till lynching, which
    had just taken place on 28 August. On 25 September, civil rights leader
    Theodore Roosevelt Mason Howard addressed a meeting of the Baltimore NAACP
    regarding the lynching and other recent killings, wondering why "Southern
    investigators of the FBI can't seem to solve a crime where a Negro is
    involved," and demanding that national leaders including "J. Edgar Hoover
    himself" be called to account for these failings in a public forum.
    <br><br>This inspired Hoover to write to Thurgood Marshall, who was then the
    head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, "to set the record
    straight." Hoover and Marshall had a well-known working relationship which
    approached something like a friendship. <br><br>Hoover's reputation for
    intimidation and anti-Communist paranoia is not on display in this letter.
    Instead, Hoover explains the chain of command between his FBI and the
    Department of Justice, notes that he had no jurisdiction in the Till case,
    and describes at length two recent cases where the FBI succeeded in bringing
    Ku Klux Klan chapters to trial. He also implies credit for a dramatic
    reduction in lynchings over the past decade from 65 to 16, and notes that
    the nation had seen no lynchings in 1952, 1953, or 1954. He asks Marshall,
    given his greater understanding of the FBI's role in these investigations,
    to issue a public correction on behalf of the NAACP to Howard's anti-FBI
    charges. <br><br>Accompanying this letter is a 24 September 2004 letter by
    Jack Greenberg, who worked under Marshall with the Legal Defense Fund, and
    later succeeded him as its head. In Greenberg's analysis of Hoover's letter,
    he recounts several of the prominent cases of that period including the Till
    case, and adds that "the civil rights community . . . believed that the U.S.
    Department of Justice, as well as the FBI, was doing hardly anything to put
    an end to that violence." Greenberg appended photocopies of 3 related Hoover
    letters at the Library of Congress dated 6 September, 13 September, and 11
    October 1955. Writing to a White House official, Hoover dropped his veneer
    of gentle persuasion and reported his findings that the Emmett Till protests
    were a Communist plot to create unrest. Greenberg points out Hoover's
    "unintentionally comic references to the Marcus Garvey 'Back-to-Africa'
    movement that could have no conceivable relevance to any of the events and
    issues of the mid-twentieth century." Provenance: Greenberg's adopted son
    William Cole, who discusses it in his book "A Jack Greenberg Lexicon," pages
    108-9.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Thurgood Marshall first came to national prominence in 1940 as the founder
    and executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. In
    this role, he litigated Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, with fellow
    NAACP lawyer Jack Greenberg (1924-2016) as his co-counsel. In 1961, Marshall
    stepped down from the Legal Defense Fund to accept a position as a federal
    judge, and Greenberg followed in his footsteps as the new executive
    director. Marshall inscribed this portrait to Greenberg at the time he
    stepped down. Although the two had worked very closely together, they had
    minimal contact after 1961, as Marshall avoided socializing with any of his
    old legal colleagues to avoid any perception of a conflict of interest. This
    photograph hung in Greenberg's Legal Defense Fund office for 23 years, and
    then at his Columbia office until his retirement. It was said to be "perhaps
    the only material object he valued for sentimental reasons." It is described
    in William Cole's "A Jack Greenberg Lexicon," page 132. Provenance:

    the principles of freedom and justice, Martin." <br><br>Jack Greenberg
    (1924-2016) was the longtime head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational
    Fund, which provided legal assistance to Dr. King on a regular basis,
    including on the Birmingham campaign. As King recounts in Why We Can't Wait,
    after Birmingham's school system had suspended more than a thousand
    demonstrators from their schools, on 22 May 1963, "we decided to take the
    issue into the courts and did so, through the auspices of the N.A.A.C.P.
    Legal Defense and Educational Fund. . . . The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals
    . . . strongly condemned the Board of Education for its action. . . . It was
    a jubilant moment, another victory in the titanic struggle. The following
    day, in an appropriate postscript, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled Eugene
    'Bull' Connor and his fellow commissioners out of office, once and for all"
    (pages 115-116). Greenberg and the Legal Defense Fund represented King while
    he was in the Birmingham Jail and helped secure his release. A year after
    Why We Can't Wait was published, Greenberg and three Legal Defense Fund
    colleagues drafted the route for the famed march from Selma to Montgomery
    and filed the plan with the State of Alabama. <br><br>Provenance: consigned

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The Civil Rights Law Institutes were held by the NAACP Legal Defense and
    Educational Fund from at least 1964 to 1968 as weekend training conferences
    for civil rights lawyers. These binders codified effective legal strategies
    for moving civil rights cases through the courts, and were perhaps the first
    systematic effort toward a methodology of civil rights litigation. They have
    introductions by Legal Defense Fund head Jack Greenberg. <br><br>The first
    two binders are titled "Civil Rights Law Institutes: Cases and Materials."
    Greenberg credits their preparation to a team of distinguished law
    professors such as Marvin Frankel, Louis Henkin, Louis Pollak, Anthony
    Amsterdam, and more. The third binder is credited solely to Anthony G.
    Amsterdam, titled "The Defensive Transfer of Civil Rights Litigation from
    State to Federal Courts." It is complete with "Volume I" and "Volume II" in
    one binder. The binder is undated, but this institute was discussed in the
    16 December 1964 issue of the Lake Charles (LA) American-Press. It traces
    strategies for getting cases into federal courts where they would receive a
    fairer hearing and have broader impact. While some copies of these binders
    have been preserved in libraries, we trace none at auction. Provenance: the

    A transcript of a series of interviews with Jack Greenberg (1924-2016) in

    and Educational Fund. The interviews were done in 1974 and 1975 by Kitty
    Gellhorn of the Oral History Research Office of Greenberg's alma mater,
    Columbia University. His early life is discussed through page 37, his time
    at Columbia (undergraduate and law school) and World War Two through page
    86, and the bulk of the remainder is dedicated to his work with the Legal
    Defense Fund. A personal name index at the end notes multiple references to
    Angela Davis, Martin Luther King, James Meredith, Lyndon B. Johnson, and
    especially his mentor Thurgood Marshall. For example, on page 280 he recalls
    asking President Johnson in person to appoint better judges to federal
    courts in the South. Johnson promised to do so, and then actually followed
    through, vetting his appointments with civil rights leadership. This
    typescript was one of only 4 copies, with the other 3 being filed at

    Supreme Court, including the historic Brown v. Board of Education, he helped
    break down the legal underpinnings of desegregation in America, and . . .
    has helped shape a more just society." <br><br>You may note an amusing error
    in the text. Greenberg devoted his career to fighting segregation, not
    desegregation. Greenberg requested a corrected certificate from Clinton's

    Booker T. Washington dined at the White House with President Theodore
    Roosevelt on 17 October 1901. This print was produced to celebrate the
    historic occasion. This was apparently the only project of the Royal Picture
    Gallery of Chicago. They took out classified ads in several newspapers
    across the country, such as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on 24 January 1904,
    seeking sales agents for "our copyrighted equality picture . . . quick
    sellers; big profits; can be sold at sight in every colored household."
    <br><br>You might think this print is non-controversial, but then you would
    be wrong. One of the print's salesmen in Mississippi was the subject of an
    outraged letter printed in the Jackson Daily News on 11 March 1904: "To the
    Royal Picture Gallery Company: I say that, if you be the real authors of
    this work, if we came to your places, hung every one of you as high as Haman
    and guarded your hanging carcasses until the carrion birds had eaten them,
    we would still be in debt to you for rougher usage. To Booker Washington,
    because of this example, the world and the negro would have been better off
    if you had never been born. It offsets all your other work." The police in
    Vicksburg, MS were on the hunt to arrest salesmen of this image because it
    "appealed to race prejudice," according to the Vicksburg Herald of 8 April
    1904. The active censorship apparently had a strong effect. Today, none of
    these widely distributed prints are traced in the international library

    anti-Catholic? Are you going to allow Ku Klux Klan propaganda to be
    displayed in the movies in New York City?"<br><br>At the protest, 5 NAACP

    World War One veteran (and future noted sociologist) Edward Franklin
    Frazier; veteran sailor Llewelyn Rollock (in uniform); and his sister-in-law

    The journalist Henry Lee Moon (1901-1985) was a Howard University graduate
    who began writing for the Amsterdam News in 1931. This essay was, as far as
    we know, never published. It was written in the wake of the 1933 split
    between the NAACP and W.E.B. Du Bois, and traces the recent history of Black
    leadership, from the frictions between Du Bois and Booker T. Washington, to
    the fading influence of Marcus Garvey, to the failure of socialism and
    communism to make substantial inroads into the Black community. His
    conclusions are sympathetic toward socialism: "The Negro's way out is the
    way of all labor--the socialization of industry and the resulting abolition
    of the competitive system upon which race hatreds flourish."

    A detailed account of the creation of the Hall of Negro Life at the 1936
    Texas Centennial Exposition, as told by its general manager Jesse Thomas of
    the National Urban League. It features photographs of several exhibits,
    including a mural by Aaron Douglas (discussed on pages 25-27). The exhibit
    was dedicated on 19 June 1936 in commemoration of Juneteenth, and received
    rave reviews from attendees and the press, to the extent that it
    substantially improved race relations in Dallas. The appointment of the
    first Black policemen to the city's force is attributed to the policemen's
    convention held at the Hall (pages 89-90). Not in Blockson or

    deLesseps Story "Chep" Morrison (1912-1964) served as a white Democratic
    mayor of New Orleans from 1946 to 1961. This poster was produced from a
    segregationist perspective in reaction to his 1950 re-election campaign,
    warning that he had integrated the city's auditorium and was allowing Black
    residents to register to vote. <br><br>This poster was probably not very
    effective for white supremacist purposes, as it inevitably circulated in the
    Black press; the Pittsburgh Courier reproduced it on 28 January 1950. The
    sub-headlines would have all played well in the Black community: "Mayor of
    New Orleans Gives Negroes Equal Political and Social Rights"; "Negroes to be
    Placed on Police Force"; "Auditorium to become Negro Pleasure Set";
    "National Negro Paper Hails Morrison." The large reproduction of the state's
    Reconstruction-era legislature would certainly evoke nostalgia among Black
    voters as well. Morrison did indeed win re-election, and did indeed
    integrate the police force that year. This poster might make you think he
    was a visionary crusader for civil rights, but he later spoke in favor of
    segregation in 1959. None in OCLC, none traced at auction.

    These posters were issued in support of the desegregation of Boston public

    Soiling of Old Glory," in which a protester swings an American flag at a
    Black lawyer who happened to be walking by. The photograph was the subject
    of a 2008 book by Louis Masur. The other two posters are titled "Desegregate
    the Schools!" and "Join the Fight against Racism!" (featuring a photograph
    of anti-segregation protesters). Each poster also features a pitch for the

    On 4 February 1999, Guinean immigrant Amadou Diallo was mistaken for a rape
    suspect by New York City police officers. When he reached for his wallet to
    show identification, the unarmed man was shot 41 times. The officers were
    acquitted of all charges. After Diallo's funeral at a New York mosque, the
    procession headed to the airport to return his body to Guinea. An

    In the course of this lengthy testimony, a Black man confesses to the
    killing of a drunk during a botched robbery, and explains the sordid life of
    crime in Schoharie, NY which led him to that point. Several murders are
    described beyond the one he was convicted for, including two of his officers
    in the 20th United States Colored Troops during the Civil War. While
    Steenburgh's story is not uplifting in any way, the rich background detail
    on Black life in small upstate New York towns makes for interesting reading.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Third edition, second state--bound and issued by Douglass at his press--and
    one of the few instances of a book's later edition being more important than
    the first. Late in 1847, not long after returning from his period of English
    exile, Frederick Douglass moved from Boston to upstate New York and began
    publishing his own newspaper, to be called the "North Star." He brought with
    him some loose printed sheets of the Boston Anti-Slavery Society's 1847
    third edition of his Narrative. Once established in Rochester, he had them
    bound up as they are here, with the North Star imprint. We have traced no
    copies of the North Star binding with the frontispiece plate found in the
    Boston first issue; Douglass apparently did not bring the engravings along
    with the text sheets. <br><br>The original owner of this copy, Daniel
    McWilliams of Rochester, signed and inscribed it in 1850. This appears to be
    the Daniel McWilliams (1820-1883), born in Scotland, who was listed as a
    tinman in the 1851 Rochester directory, was in the 1860 census in nearby
    Albion as a tinsmith, and wrote a serialized memoir for the Neighbor's Home
    Mail in 1874, "An Autobiography: How I Became a Drunkard." In the June 1874
    installment (page 107), he discusses his time in Rochester and working in a
    tin shop, although he does not mention any connection to the abolitionist
    movement. Nor can we guess why he decorated both pastedowns with crude
    sketches of hands. He died in East Bloomfield, NY. <br><br>This Rochester
    issue is believed to be the only book Douglass ever issued from his own
    press, and this is by far the finest of the six examples we have traced at
    auction.

    This photograph was likely taken of Douglass on 10 March 1873. He was then
    publishing his final newspaper, the New National Era, and had recently
    relocated to Washington. That day he was in Philadelphia to lecture at the
    Academy of Music. Four blocks away was the studio of photographer John White
    Hurn (1823-1887), who had fully earned the confidence of Douglass over a
    period of years. <br><br>Back in 1859, Hurn had been working as a
    Philadelphia telegraph operator when news of John Brown's capture came
    through the wires--along with an order for the local sheriff to arrest
    Frederick Douglass as a conspirator. Hurn was an ardent abolitionist and
    Douglass supporter. He stepped away from the telegraph office, got the word
    out that Douglass was in danger, and promised to delay the delivery of the
    message for three hours so Douglass could get out of town. This allowed
    Douglass to safely reach Canada just ahead of the authorities. When Hurn
    later became a photographer, Douglass sat for him three times in a total of
    nine extant poses--the most by any photographer. Here we see Douglass posed
    comfortably in the studio of an old ally. <br><br>Only two other examples of
    this pose have been traced in institutions, at the Library of Congress and
    the George Eastman House. See "Picturing Frederick Douglass," #71 and pages

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Douglass makes arrangements for a lecture on his old friend John Brown,
    whose raid on Harper's Ferry he had supported but refused to join back in
    1859. Here he writes: "You may depend upon me for a lecture on 'John Brown'
    in Vineland Tuesday evening December 12th on the conditions already agreed
    to. I hope you will give me a good audience on the occasion. My health is
    quite equal to the work before me. Please tell me at what time it will be
    necessary to leave Philadelphia in order to reach you in time? I can be in
    Philadelphia about half past one on the afternoon of Tuesday. Will this be
    early enough to connect for Vineland?" <br><br>Vineland, NJ was founded as a
    progressive utopian community in 1862; Douglass was recruited as an early
    member but never moved there. Douglass revealed many of the details of his
    relationship with John Brown for the first time in an 1881 lecture at Storer
    College, and elaborated on them in his 1881 autobiography, "Life and Times."
    He lectured frequently on Brown over the next few years. His first wife Anna
    died in August 1882, and Douglass was widely reported to be in ill health in
    late November and December 1882. December 12th fell on a Tuesday in 1876,
    1882, and 1893, but the 1882 date seems most likely, although he was still
    on the lecture circuit in 1893. <br><br>WITH--a period photograph of an

    Contains an important speech by Douglass. On 15 October 1883, the Supreme
    Court delivered a decision on what are known as "the Civil Rights Cases,"
    ruling that the 13th and 14th Amendments did not forbid racial
    discrimination by private individuals or companies, which nullified the
    Civil Rights Act of 1875. This devastating decision essentially provided
    legal sanction to Jim Crow practices for decades to come.<br><br>A week
    after the decision, before the opinions were even published, a protest
    meeting was held in Washington. This pamphlet records the minutes of the
    meeting, as well as keynote speeches by Frederick Douglass (pages 4-14) and
    white liberal orator Robert Ingersoll (15-53). The Douglass speech ranks as
    one of his most stirring. He argues that the Civil Rights Bill did not
    establish social equality between the races, it merely confirmed what was
    already clear from the Declaration of Independence, the Sermon on the Mount,
    and the Golden Rule. In conclusion, he notes that "no where, outside of the
    United States, is any man denied civil rights on account of his color."

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    John Brown Russwurm (1799-1851) was born in Jamaica, the son of an unknown
    enslaved woman and her owner. He moved to Portland, ME in 1812 with his
    father, and graduated from Bowdoin College in 1826 as just the third Black
    college graduate in the United States. He later founded the abolitionist
    Freedom's Journal in 1827--the first Black-owned and operated newspaper in
    the country, which he published for two years before emigrating to Liberia.
    <br><br>Offered here is a letter written when Russwurm was only 19 years
    old, before he began college. He begins by addressing his secondary
    education: "Well, what think you, friend Otis, Hebron Academy burnt down?
    Astonishing, you would reply. Not all so, I consider it as the judgment of
    heaven for their treatment of the few independent souls who resided with
    them during the past year. True is the saying 'all for the best,' for we see
    it plainly proved in the visitations of heaven on the Hebronites. . . . You
    inquired the reason of not appearing in Hebron the last quarter. I mentioned
    when I came away to Shubael Tripp that if I studied all winter I should not
    be in Hebron any more (to school); and another, is that I did want to come,
    for I might have been there all the time that school kept, as such was the
    desire of my guardian. I shall attend the two ensuing months at Gorham
    Academy, I expect as soon as my guardian returns from Boston, and I can get
    ready." He concludes by wishing Otis well in his studies, and sending
    greetings to mutual friends. <br><br>Provenance: formerly on deposit at

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This letter was written by Shaler Granby Hillyer (1809-1900), a white man
    who was at that time a self-described "school-master" in Athens, Georgia.
    His letter contains one intriguing passage: "Our coloured school has
    adjourned till the 1st Sabbath in Jan. We were compelled to do this from
    total want of teachers. Miss J. Cosby & myself were all we could procure for
    a constancy. Dr. Linton is married, Miss Calloway has gone to Salem N.C,
    Sarah N. has gone to Milledgeville, and Miss J. is all that is left for me
    to confide my troubles, and she is at present unwell." <br><br>We can find
    no record of any educational institution for Black students in Athens before
    emancipation, and there must have been few if any throughout the South. As
    this school was held on the Sabbath, we suspect it was a Bible study class,
    which would be unusual enough. Hillyer was a southerner from a Yankee family
    (his middle name was taken from a town in Connecticut); he became a Baptist
    preacher in 1832 and continued for a remarkable 68 years.

    In 1831, Prudence Crandall (1803-1890) established the Canterbury Female
    Boarding School for the education of aristocratic girls from Connecticut and
    beyond. In the fall of 1832, a Black girl applied for admission to the
    school. Crandall consulted her Bible and decided to admit the girl, thus
    establishing the first integrated school in the United States. This did not
    last for very long, as all of the white parents quickly withdrew their
    daughters from the school. In April 1833, Crandall reopened for "young
    Ladies and little Misses of color," enrolling girls from across the
    northeast. The next month, Connecticut passed a law in reaction forbidding
    the education of Black children from out of state, and in July Crandall was
    arrested. No examples of this trial report have been traced at auction since
    1940; not in Blockson or Afro-Americana.

    Storer College grew out of a humble school for freedmen in Harpers Ferry
    which was established in 1865. It was chartered in 1868, and became an
    important locus of the early civil rights movement, in part because of its
    proximity to the site of John Brown's raid. Frederick Douglass delivered an
    important speech on John Brown there in 1881, the NAACP was born there in

    First printing of the famous map depicting the height of the Harlem

    ("one of the fastest stepping revues in N.Y."), Gladys's Clam House (a gay
    speakeasy featuring drag artists: "Gladys Bentley wears a tuxedo and high
    hat and tickles the ivories"), Tillie's Chicken Shack, and many others are
    shown, with little vignettes throughout of Harlem characters, such as Jeff
    Blount of the Radium Club, Snakehips Earl Tucker, the "Reefer Man," the
    "Crab Man," Don Redman, and Bill "Bojangles" Robinson ("The world's greatest
    tapdancer"). The caption recommends "a dozen Marahuana cigarettes guaranteed
    to give a three-day jag," and explains the numbers racket: "Most of the
    gamblers pick their numbers from dream books." <br>The artist Simms Campbell
    (1906-1971) was best known as an Esquire artist from 1933 until the late

  CROSSHEAD: Scrapbook of actor-pianist Reginald Beane.
  at-a-glance: 'Various places, 1939-1944'
  TYPESET: >-
    3 photographs, 28 partial telegraph messages, 4 letters, 5 tickets, a typed
    CV, and many dozens of newspaper and program clippings mounted on 28
    scrapbook leaves. Folio, original string-bound boards, front board detached;
    leaves worn and most edges reinforced with tape, several items detached or
    missing.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Reginald "Sonny" Beane (1918-1985) was born in Bermuda and came to New York
    with his mother soon after his birth. He went on to a distinguished career
    as an actor and pianist, with the early years well-documented in this album.
    Beane was cast in the Pulitzer Prize-winning first play by distinguished
    author William Saroyan, "The Time of Your Life," in 1939. Beane had a key
    supporting role as a "colored boy who plays a mean and melancholy
    Boogie-Woogie piano," and performed 4 of his original compositions as part
    of the show. Included here are numerous clippings of reviews and programs,
    as well as two pages of clipped congratulatory telegrams from Ethel Waters,
    Frances Williams, and the playwright, who cabled "Your work enhances the
    values in my play very much and I am deeply grateful." Also included are a
    Letter Signed by Saroyan dated 8 February 1940, praising Beane at greater
    length and adding "I'm sure some day there will be an even better part in
    one of my plays for you to play, and if you are free we'll hope the play
    won't flop." A postcard from Saroyan repeats the sentiment. A photograph
    shows Beane at his piano in a 1940 Chicago performance of the play.
    <br><br>A 1939 photograph shows Beane with the pioneering Black conductor
    Eva Jessye, and another depicts a July 1941 banquet in honor of Jessye,
    where they are joined by singers Georgette Harvey and Abbie Mitchell, and
    more. Three later 1941 and 1942 telegrams from Ethel Waters invite him to
    Los Angeles for "a vaudeville engagement"--the play "Mamba's Daughters" in
    which she starred. His typed list of credits runs from 1934 to 1941, with
    other highlights including a stint as assistant choral director and
    accompanist in "Porgy and Bess." A 1943 letter from the principal of an
    Oakland, CA junior high school thanks Beane for his visit, which inspired
    "our nearly 500 Negro students." A 1944 promotional card shows Beane on the
    bill with actor Canada Lee and trumpeter Erskine Hawkins at a benefit
    concert in Atlanta. This album is a remarkable slice of show-biz life from a
    talented performer who crossed paths with many of the biggest names of his
    era.

    became longtime friends; Davis became the first Black man to stay at the
    White House as an invited guest in 1973. Both are captioned on verso with
    inked credit stamps of Jess Rand, press agent of Davis, who is believed to

    career safely, he paid Loray White a large sum to participate in a sham
    marriage, under the agreement that it would be soon dissolved. Davis's press
    agent Jess Rand has appended a later note on the circumstances of this

    wedding). He took her out once. They never talked to each other or lived

    Thomas J. Martin was a free Black composer and music teacher active in New
    Orleans from 1854 to 1860 who published several songs. He was arrested on
    charges of seducing some of his students in 1860, and nearly lynched. The

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    An ambitious and long-forgotten composition by one of America's first great
    Black composers. An opera set on a post-Reconstruction Arkansas plantation,
    it incorporates ballet, arias, and other classical forms in addition to the
    ragtime which Joplin was best known for. It tells the story of a young woman
    struggling to free her community from ignorance and superstition.
    <br><br>Joplin self-published this score in 1911, but was never able to
    mount a full production, just a disastrous 1915 read-through, and a
    performance of one ballet by a school group. With his death in 1917, the
    work fell into near-total obscurity. During a ragtime revival in the 1970s,
    the score was rediscovered. The first full performance was not until 1972,
    long after Joplin's death; modern dance master Katherine Dunham was the
    director. It has been staged several times since, to glowing reviews.
    <br><br>This copy was a personal gift from Joplin's widow Lottie Stokes
    Joplin (circa 1875-1953), who remained in New York after his death. It was
    given to Etta Moten Barnett (1901-2004), an established singer and actress
    who had performed at the White House. <br><br>Only one other copy of this
    original score has been traced at auction, which sold at Swann on 15

    Substantial archive of Louis Armstrong, including memoirs, signed contract,
    travel itineraries, and more.
  at-a-glance: 'Various places, 1950-1970 and undated'
  TYPESET: >-
    Approximately 145 items (0.3 linear feet) in one box; condition generally
    strong.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This archive helps tell the story of the great jazz trumpeter and vocalist
    Louis Armstrong (1901-1971). It was collected by his longtime personal
    physician and close associate Dr. Alexander Schiff (1899-1990), who
    accompanied Armstrong on tour through most of the 1960s. <br><br>Most
    notable in this lot are a group of Armstrong's typescript memoirs. "Satchmo
    in Hawaii" is an original typescript in 22 single-spaced pages, signed by
    Armstrong at the end, with his initials on every page. The first 8 pages are
    on yellow "Satchmo" letterhead, and the remainder on mismatched plain
    sheets, the whole bound in one corner with a tied rubber band. It was
    written on 5 March 1952, and begins with a gig in Sacramento's Clayton Club
    [24 February 1952]. It recounts every detail of the ensuing week-long tour
    of Hawaii, commenting on other jazz players he hears there, every enormous
    meal he eats, every radio interview. His process is explained on page 16: "I
    sit here listening to my tape recorder, which I usually keep going
    constantly while I'm writing." He signs it "Am red beans and ricely yours,
    Louis Armstrong." <br><br>Two shorter memoirs appear to be carbon copies,
    and are not signed. "The Roaring Twenties, Chicago, Ill." is 9 pages, with
    several inked notes and corrections, covering events from his early career
    in 1922. "The Satchmo Story" is 10 pages, also with numerous corrections,
    covering his time in Chicago in 1931, ranging from his fondness for
    marijuana to the health problems which afflicted trombonist Jimmy Harrison.
    This one is accompanied by a torn and stained 10 December 1954 letter signed
    by Armstrong to agent Joe Glaser: "I am sending this part of the story in
    now as I think it is important." Finally, a pair of "Recordio-Disc"
    home-recorded 45-rpm phonograph records has "Armstrong's Story as read by
    Lucille Armstrong," recorded in Washington on 31 October 1950 and sent to
    agent Glaser. The memoirs appear to be unpublished, and we trace no other
    examples of the "Roaring Twenties." <br><br>One other item is signed by
    Armstrong, a contract arranged by Associated Booking Corporation for a
    4-week tour in Germany and Czechoslovakia in 1965. Armstrong signed both the
    one-page contract and the final page of the 3-page typed rider.
    <br><br>Photographs include a packet of 23 snapshots from a Japanese tour,
    most 6½ x 4¾ inches and most depicting Armstrong; an 8 x 10-inch shot of
    Armstrong and his entourage dining at the Empire Room in Chicago; 14 8 x
    10-inch publicity photographs (some duplicates); and an 8 x 10 shot of
    Armstrong and friends at the Mr. President Hotel in Grand Rapids, MI.
    <br><br>A folder of correspondence and memoranda, 1951-1969 (29 items) is
    mostly directed to Armstrong's physician Alexander Schiff, and largely
    relates to Armstrong tour arrangements and medical treatment, but sometimes
    extends into creative territory. Highlights include a 1951 film pitch for
    "The Louis Armstrong Story"; 1959 cameraman's report on filming "Louis
    Armstrong in the Holy Land"; and letters arranging a 1960 African tour.
    Agent Joe Glaser, a frequent correspondent, wrote to the doctor on 2 January
    1968: "See that Louis rehearses a couple of those new songs and gets ready
    to do them on the Hollywood Place show, because I don't want him to repeat
    anything." Another thick folder of tour calendars and itineraries (40 items)
    in a variety of formats is dated 1959-1970. <br><br>Printed ephemera
    includes 9 programs from Armstrong events, 1965-1970; Down Beat Magazine's
    "Salute to Satch" from 1965; and postcards from resort appearances
    (including some duplicates). More unusual is a German medical article
    offprint from 1961 describing dental treatment for horn players.
    <br><br>Provenance: collected by Dr. Alexander Schiff, and then by gift to
    the consignor.

  CROSSHEAD: Archive of Dizzy Gillespie's personal music and arrangements.
  at-a-glance: 'Various places, 1970s-1980s'
  TYPESET: >-
    Several hundred pages of manuscript music in various hands plus other
    papers  (0.6 linear feet); plus 9 books in a separate box; a bit musty, some
    items with moderate to heavy wear or dampstaining.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This large cache of music was purchased at auction from the estate of the
    great trumpet player and Ambassador of Jazz, John Birks "Dizzy" Gillespie
    (1917-1993). It includes more than 70 pieces of manuscript sheet music from
    Gillespie's collection. By volume, the bulk are arrangements for songs
    performed by his band, as copied out for him by professional
    transcriptionists, with parts for several instruments, or sometimes just
    trumpet. They include one of his most popular co-compositions, the Cuban
    jazz classic "Manteca" from 1947, as written out by arranger-copyist Jewell
    Grant, with the parts for the second alto sax, and a trumpet part stamped
    simply "Dizzy" (illustrated). Many others are by notable arrangers.
    Highlights include: the national anthems of Iran, Pakistan, and Yugoslavia
    as arranged by Quincy Jones for trumpet, presumably in preparation for a
    world tour; 4 pieces arranged by regular Gillespie composer Benny Golson
    including "Blues After Dark," "Just by Myself," "Out of the Past," and
    "Seabreeze"; 3 pieces arranged by Gillespie associate Gigi Gryce, "A Nite at
    Tony's," "Shabozz," and "Smoke Signal"; a piece titled "C.W.3" with the tune
    credited to Bill Cosby and Dizzy Gillespie and the arrangement by
    Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson; and an arrangement of W.C. Handy's "St. Louis
    Blues." Other pieces range widely on a spectrum from compositions sent by
    admirers, to formal arrangements created for band use. Compositions sent to
    Gillespie include works by Niagara Falls jazzman Spider Martin, with 1982
    cover letter; "Nigerian Waterfalls" by actor-musician Santiago Gonzalez;
    pieces by Steve Turre and T.J. Anderson of Tufts University; 3
    transcriptions of Gillespie's recorded performances by Don Erjavec; and
    more. A list of the compositions in this lot is available upon request. Also
    included in this archive are: <br><br>Gillespie's memoir "To Be or Not to
    Bop," 1984 German edition, signed on the front free endpaper "Dizzy
    Gillespie '88," plus 4 unsigned copies of the 1981 French edition, and 3
    unsigned copies of the 1980 Finnish edition.<br><br>Ralph Berton's 1974

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    These tapes were purchased from the estate of the great trumpet player John
    Birks "Dizzy" Gillespie. We have not listened to them, so we can't guarantee
    what's on them, or their playability--we can only testify to what's written
    on the labels, which are enough to be quite intriguing. The lot includes 21
    labelled 7-inch reel-to-reel audio tapes, with labels such as "Part 2,
    Gillespie & Lombardo," "Rehearsal (Woody, Chris, Rudy, Kenny) Begin the
    Beguine"; "April 21 1963, Dizzy Gillespie, A Negro Looks at Patriotism";
    "Sonny Stitt"; ten songs by the Trinidad calypso player Lord Melody; "To
    Dizzy & Lorraine from Lucille & Satch"; "Woody Rehearsal"; "Talking with
    Bobby Hackett"; "J.P., Wes, John, Russell (baseball)"; "Dizzy Movie Themes";
    "Sao Paulo 8-20-56"; "Aircheck--Penthouse 6-13-62"; and "Lalu, Chuck, Leo,
    Art." Two with water-damaged cases might still be worth a try: "McIntosh"
    (likely his 1963 collaborator, trombonist Tom McIntosh), and "Bird."
    <br><br>Also included are 3 VHS video cassettes: "Do I Do, featured guest
    artist John Gillespie"; "Olympic gala, Dizzy Gillespie Segment with into"
    dated 4 August 1984; and a later recording of the 1967 Monterey Jazz
    Festival. A 3-inch tape is labeled "Jack Paar, 13 March 1961," and another
    reads "Dizzy Gillespie sound tape (audio)." A 9½-inch tape is from
    Radiotelevisione Italiana and features 5 tracks by Italian trumpeter Nunzio
    Rotondo. An additional 23 reel-to-reels in various formats are unlabeled,
    and might contain anything from blank static to the Dead Sea Scrolls.

    Kingdom, often billing himself as a native of Africa, and went on to a long

    This production at New York's Grand Opera House featured Mr. and Mrs. George
    C. Howard, who were behind the original 1852 stage adaptation, and continued
    in their original roles as St. Clair and Topsy. <br><br>This program was
    printed as an issue of "Pleasure Season: Music, Literature and the Fine
    Arts," published by J.C. Foreman. It was nominally an independent
    publication, and boasted of circulation at "all the principal hotels and
    reading rooms" in the New York area. This issue includes a bit of general
    theatrical gossip, and two short articles--one of them discussing the
    present Uncle Tom's production. Pleasure Season apparently existed to
    publish Grand Opera House programs and take in advertising revenue, similar
    to the modern Playbill publication. See Engle and Miller, The American
    Stage, page 108. This program was annotated by Cort family, who attended the
    performance: siblings Arthur and Jessie Cort (aged about 15 and 10) and
    their mother.

    The Hyers family were groundbreaking figures who brought Black musical

    Bondage" was their best-known production, a story of slavery and
    emancipation with a Black cast--here including the important actor Sam
    Lucas. This independently produced playbill offers an act-by-act synopsis of
    the plot for Out of Bondage and a full cast list, with numerous local
    advertisements, and the bill for an unrelated play on verso. Out of Bondage
    debuted in 1875 or 1876, and was performed in St. Joseph, Missouri on
    Monday, 8 November 1886.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    A typescript of the groundbreaking play, the first by a Black woman on
    Broadway, and the first with a Black director. This copy apparently belonged
    to the Academy Award-nominated American actress Juanita Moore (1914-2014),
    who played the role of Mama Lena Younger in the Adelphi Theatre staging of
    the play in London. It opened in August 1959, a few months after the
    Broadway debut. Her signature appears above the title, along with more than
    a dozen other memoranda, some apparently relating to her efforts to find
    lodging in London. Elwood Smith, who was an understudy in the Broadway
    production and later played the lead as Walter Younger in the 1960 Boston
    production, has added his New Orleans address as well. The script is loaded
    with manuscript notes, some of them apparently in Moore's hand, and many of
    them relating to the character of Mama--both elaborations on the stage
    instructions, and character motivations. <br><br>WITH--3 photographs from

    Family papers of Littleton L. Page of Charles Town, WV, including sons in
    the Spanish-American War and World War One.
  at-a-glance: 'Various places, 1875-1919'
  TYPESET: 32 items (0.4 linear feet) in one box; various sizes and conditions.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Littleton Lorton Page (1850-1914) was born into slavery, and made his way to
    the Union lines to serve in a Colored Troops unit, taking his name from an
    officer named Littleton Lorton. After the war, he founded the first school
    for Black students in Charles Town, WV, and served as a trustee of Storer
    College in nearby Harpers Ferry; the local high school is named in his
    honor. Offered here is a lively grouping of his family papers, most of them
    relating to the military service of his two sons. The collection begins with
    4 charming letters from Page to his future wife Georgianna Smith, Charles
    Town, WV, 1875-1877. One apparently alludes to his initiation into a Masonic
    group: "I have just returned from the lodge, but have not been hauled over
    the coals yet. . . . There is not much fun in it for me, but I must stop as
    I am to tell no secrets." <br><br>Oldest son Henry Littleton "Harry" Page
    (1880-1954) sends 4 letters while in service during the Spanish-American War
    while in training camp in Kentucky and Georgia (plus one enclosed letter
    from a friend). He served in the 8th Immune regiment, raised among Black
    recruits from Kentucky, eastern Tennessee, and West Virginia in hopes that
    they might be malaria-resistant. 3 are on patriotic letterhead featuring
    Admiral George Dewey. After his first payday, Harry wrote on 22 September
    "As soon as I got my money, I gave it to Lieut. Hill because the boys steal
    so." He was appointed regimental orderly, and they were reviewed by
    Secretary of War Alger, who pronounced them "the best regiment in the
    state." In an undated letter, he wrote "I just came off guard last night at
    the hospital. There are over 350 patients in there with different kinds of
    diseases. Some are from Santiago de Cuba, shot in different places." An
    uncaptioned photograph of a military band appears to date from this period
    and may include Harry. Also included are 3 postcards addressed to Harry from
    sister Cerelle and a friend in 1908 while he was traveling with Stetson's
    Uncle Tom's Cabin theatrical troupe. <br><br>Second son Gouverneur Morris
    "G.M." Page (1890-1958) wrote several letters home. 3 were written while a
    student at Storer College, WV, 1905-1906. The big excitement on 1 March 1906
    was a fellow student in the mail room "rifling the letters and they caught
    him. He took in about forty dollars." G.M. enlisted in for service in World
    War One with the 803rd Infantry. 10 letters and postcards were written from
    training camp at Camp Custer, MI; Camp Upton, NY; and "somewhere in Canada."
    On 12 August 1918 he wrote "I don't find anything so hard about it. The main
    thing is to be punctual, obey orders and whatever you do, do it with a snap.
    Tomorrow I think we begin bayonet drill. . . . This is certainly some bunch
    of colored folks in this company. . . . I have one fellow whose name is
    Peter Lukey and he is a young giant from the mountains of W. Va, 20 yrs old,
    can't read and write, and guesses at his age from what somebody told him.
    There are some fellows here who don't know what their mother's name is, and
    don't know one letter from another." On 20 August he writes "I was selected
    as a candidate for officers training camp, but my heart was slightly
    irregular Sunday when I was examined and don't expect to pass; the physical
    examination for the officers camp was about five times more rigid than the
    one we took when we first came here." <br><br>These camp letters are
    followed by 8 letters and 2 postcards which G.M. wrote from France, 30
    October 1918 to 12 February 1919. In his first, he jabs at his brother:
    "Tell Harry I expect I will have a few things to tell him about soldiering
    when I get back. He used to talk about the Spanish American War, well that
    was a scrimmage compared to this." On 18 November he writes his mother with
    alarm: "Cerelle told me you were trying to catch the influenza, but I hope
    you have not succeeded. . . . I am sorry so many deaths have occurred from
    the influenza." On 2 December he described a "place today that at one time
    had been a woods, but now not a tree is left, and not an inch of ground
    which has not been rooted up by shells." On 12 February 1919, after the
    censors had lightened up, he offered more details on his service: "Yes, we
    were up in the Toul sector and the St. Mihiel sector, up near Verdun and the
    Argonne. . . . Seen German planes brought down, balloons on fire . . . It
    was a terrible one and I hope there will be no more like it in my time at
    least." Also included are G.M.'s certificate to practice law in the District
    of Columbia, 1922; and his baptismal certificate from 1945. <br><br>Finally,
    the collection contains a photo album presented by Littleton Page to his
    sweetheart Georgia in 1877. It begins with two small penny photos from
    Charles Town, very likely depicting Littleton and Georgia. They are followed
    by 16 unidentified tintypes and cartes-de-visite of Black sitters, followed
    by 10 others of white sitters. Most of the latter portraits are quite
    defaced.

    The Menelek Club, named after an emperor of Ethiopia, had a short window as
    the center of Louisville's high society. Its formal opening was on 1 July
    1926, and it was frequently discussed in the "Louisville's Elite" column of
    the Pittsburgh Courier for the next three years. On 22 January 1927, they
    announced that "the Menelek Club is rapidly becoming the social center of
    many of the prominent young men of Louisville." On 7 September 1929, they
    held a "grand reception and ball" and "the name Menelek Club like a magnet
    attracted the elite from far and near." We find only one mention of the
    club's activities after the Great Depression hit in October 1929, when they
    hosted a dinner for the Kentucky Negro Education Association in 1932.

    7 photographs (including one duplicate), each 8 x 10 inches, with inked

    crop marks on one print, otherwise minor wear.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    These photographs were taken just before the climax of the Albany Movement,
    Dr. King's campaign to bring racial justice to the town of Albany, GA.
    Dozens of Jewish and Protestant clergymen from across the country gathered
    to hear King speak, After this gathering, they held a prayer vigil at
    Albany's city hall, which led to their arrest. <br><br>One of these
    photographs (marked with crop marks for use by the Village Voice of New
    York) shows King alone at the pulpit. Another (also present in duplicate)
    shows King at the pulpit with others as the clergymen bow their heads in
    prayer. Another shows the movement's local leader, Dr. William Gilchrist
    Anderson, seated alone by the church organ. One shows a group of 4 singers,
    and one pans over the solemn congregation. Finally, one shows a police car
    parked in front of the city hall where the vigil and arrests would soon take
    place. <br><br>These photographs were taken at Albany's Bethel A.M.E. Church
    by A. Bruce Goldman (1935-2020), a rabbi and accomplished amateur
    photographer from Paramus, NJ who went to Albany on 26 August and was one of
    69 clergymen arrested on 28 August, spending 3 days in jail. Three of his
    photographs from his trip (although none of the present group) appeared in
    the Hackensack (NJ) Record of 5 September 1962. One of them showing King at
    Shiloh in the same white tie is captioned "King addresses clergymen before
    they marched to City Hall where they were arrested." Goldman's account of
    these events was published as "Quest for Freedom in Albany's Jails" in the 4
    October 1962 Village Voice, and later gathered in the Village Voice
    Anthology (1982), pages 21-24.

    A group portrait of an early all-Black fire company. 24 firemen and 4

    facade is easily recognizable, as it remains the home of the

    department concentrated their growing number of Black personnel at this
    location in 1924, an occasion which we suspect this portrait commemorates.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Wentworth Cheswell (1746-1817) was the grandson of an African-American who
    had been freed from slavery, in addition to his three-quarters European
    ancestry. He went on to a successful career in Newmarket, NH as a teacher,
    farmer, and clerk. At the outbreak of the Revolution, he rode to the
    colonial capital to convey Paul Revere's warning, and then served for two
    years in a New Hampshire regiment. In his lifetime, he was variously
    described as white, yellow, or mulatto; he is now generally regarded as the
    first African-American to hold elected office. He was regularly elected by
    his townsmen to the offices of constable, selectman, auditor, and other
    positions from 1768 until his death. Cheswell was elected as a Justice of
    the Peace for Rockingham County, NH in 1805. <br><br>This document is a writ
    issued by Cheswell for the sheriff to collect a debt owed by Richard Hilton
    of Newmarket, NH. If Hilton failed to cover the debt, Cheswell authorized
    the sheriff "to take the body of the said Hilton and him commit unto our
    Jail." The debt was settled two months later. Cheswell was probably the only
    man of acknowledged African ancestry to routinely wield this level of legal
    authority in America during this period. Macon Bolling Allen, often
    mistakenly called the first Black justice of the peace, was not elected
    until 1844.

  CROSSHEAD: Manuscript draft of a passage from his My Southern Home.
  at-a-glance: 'No place, circa late 1870s'
  TYPESET: >-
    4 manuscript pages on 2 leaves, 7x 4¼ inches and a 4¾ x 4½-inch fragment;
    both apparently torn from a notebook, with ink blots and corrections but
    otherwise no apparent wear.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Born into slavery in Kentucky, William Wells Brown (circa 1814-1884) escaped
    at the age of 19 and became a prominent author and abolitionist. His Clotel
    is regarded as the first novel by an African American. In his later years in
    Boston, his second wife Annie Elizabeth Gray Brown (1835-1902) managed the
    family publishing company, while Brown practiced homeopathic medicine. His
    final book, My Southern Home, was a fictionalized memoir. <br><br>The
    present manuscript is a rough draft of one comic passage in the book, in
    which the master Dr. Gaines deputizes his slave Cato to serve as physician
    in his absence. Cato attempts to pull the tooth of another enslaved man, but
    pulls the wrong one. Brown had published at least three variants of this
    "Negro Dentist" story before, but this manuscript contains elements unique
    to the version in My Southern Home, pages 30-31. On the verso of the second
    page are a few completely unrelated lines on the Napoleonic Wars in the same
    hand. <br><br>The manuscript is discussed at length in Ezra Greenspan's
    recent biography of Brown (see below): "The scene of Sam as the Black Doctor
    is the nearly unique instance in which a manuscript documenting Brown's
    compositional practice survives . . . written in an unidentified hand
    (perhaps Annie's). The manuscript is undated, but it was very likely written
    in the late 1870s as a trial draft for a scene in chapter 3 of My Southern
    Home. Although the entire scene derives from Act 1, Scene 2, of The Escape,
    it introduces new details and language that exactly match the text of My
    Southern Home, as when Dr. Gaines is described sarcastically as 'saluting
    [Cato] in his usual kind and indulgent manner' before tasking him" (page
    497). Greenspan saw the manuscript in the private collection of the
    consignor, who is named in the footnotes on page 573. The first page is
    reproduced in Greenspan's book in a plate facing page 281.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    First and only edition, one of only fifty copies printed on Italian
    hand-made paper. Lewis Howard Latimer (1848-1928) was born near Boston; his
    parents had recently escaped from slavery and gained fame in abolitionist
    circles. Lewis joined the Navy during the Civil War and became a draftsman,
    then went on to a notable career as an inventor. Working for Alexander
    Graham Bell, he drafted the patent drawings for the telephone; he went to
    work for Thomas Edison in 1884. He was responsible for numerous patents in
    lighting, refrigeration, and more; in 1890 he wrote the first book on
    electric lighting. He is a member of the National Inventors Hall of Fame,
    and his house in Queens, NY is a designated city landmark.<br><br>In
    addition to his impressive career as an inventor, Latimer was a well-rounded
    renaissance man: he taught English classes to immigrants, played violin, and
    wrote plays and poems. The present volume contains 22 of his poems which
    were collected by his friends and published on the occasion of his 77th
    birthday. The first 11 pieces, "Poems of Love," were dedicated to his late
    wife Mary, such as "The Ebon Venus." The other 11,"Poems of Life," are
    prefaced with a plate showing Latimer's two daughters as infants and adults.
    <br><br>Provenance: inscribed to the Hest family on the limitation page. A
    New York Age article on the Latimers' golden wedding anniversary party (1
    December 1923) lists among the guests "Mrs. Hest and Miss R. Hest."
    According to the 1920 census, Ida Hest (born circa 1867) was a Russian
    immigrant who lived in the Bronx with her New York-born daughter Rose (born
    circa 1900), who worked as a messenger for a stockbroker. <br><br>3 in OCLC,

    <br><br>The inscription reads "To the National Union of Marine Cooks and
    Stewards San Francisco Office, these poems of the Freedom Train, sincerely,
    Langston Hughes, New York, May 1, 1951." <br><br>The National Union of
    Marine Cooks and Stewards represented workers on the west coast and in
    Hawaii. They were noteworthy on several fronts, and in 1951 had been
    recently in the news. An integrated union, its membership was thought to be
    about 50% Black and 25% Asian. They have also gained recognition for their
    involvement in the early LGBTQ movement, with many openly gay members and a
    sign in their union hall reading "No Race Baiting, Red-Baiting, or Queer
    Baiting." Their leadership and many of their members were leftists, and were
    expelled from the Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1950 for their
    Communist ties. During a difficult time for this progressive union, Hughes
    apparently sent his new book as a message of support from across the
    country--making it a fascinating association copy.

    Joseph Clifton Brown (1908-1993) was an author, educator, and artist who was
    usually known as Joe C. Brown. Born and raised in Mississippi, he was an
    instructor and principal at three Mississippi schools before heading north
    to Chicago in 1948 with his wife and children. There he did data processing
    for the Department of Labor, wrote a column for the Chicago World, stayed
    active in the civil rights movement, and pursued his creative endeavors on
    the side, retiring in 1976. <br><br>Brown is best known to history as a
    close lifelong friend of the author Richard Wright; he also knew the author
    William Faulkner, who became a literary mentor. Kent State University
    Library published Wright's letters to him in 1968 as "Letters to Joe C.
    Brown." This large and wide-ranging archive does not include Wright's
    original letters, but it includes much more. <br><br>The bulk of this
    collection consists of drafts and fragments of Brown's poetry, fiction, and
    essays, including a long series of aphorisms and anecdotes under the title
    "Homeboy Says." One highlight is a fragment of his memoir of Richard Wright,
    sharing his memories of "Dick's" mother and Aunt Maggie. A notebook kept at
    Rust College in 1941 includes a draft of a letter from Brown to Wright dated
    19 June 1941: "Say, Dick, we have a course here in American Negro Literature
    and Dick Wright's Native Son is the class discussion." <br><br>Brown's
    memories of William Faulkner are recorded in 3 drafts of his essay "The
    Faulkner I Met in the Red Hills." Records on the sale of two letters from
    Faulkner are also included.<br><br>The collection includes little from his
    Mississippi days, other than several worn leaves from a scrapbook dating
    from 1933 to 1940, including a typed letter from Claude A. Barnett of the
    Associated Negro Press recruiting him as a Mississippi correspondent, and
    other letters relating to his work as a school principal. After moving to
    Chicago, Brown remained involved in education, including extensive work with

    file contains letters from Wright's biographer Constance Webb, editor Horace
    Cayton, poet Dudley Randall, Sun Ra trumpeter Philip Cohran, and more.
    <br><br>Brown was not known as an artist, but was a prolific amateur with
    some talent. This lot includes 65 pieces of his work, some of it worn or
    dampstained, most of it boldly colored and somewhat abstract, 1975 to 1983
    and undated. <br><br>Ephemera in the collection includes a worn flier for an
    "All-Day Vote Caravan" in Chicago featuring Martin Luther King and John
    Lewis, 29 October 1964; a pamphlet titled "Mississippi's Rural Negro
    Schools" from 1939; a flier for the Frank London Brown Negro History Club,
    18 March 1967; and an Operation Breadbasket program featuring Jesse Jackson,
    28 August 1971. Finally, two of his printed poems issued by the Broadside
    Press of Detroit are included: "Ghetto Manchild" (1966) and "But Not Like
    Yesterday" (1968). The well-known journalist Horace R. Cayton has inscribed
    a copy of the latter: "The moving lines of Joe Brown's tribute to Martin
    Luther King at the time of his death revitalized in me my own feelings of
    anguish, shock, hope, and a new steeled dedication."

    Brister or Bristol Warner was manumitted by his master Daniel Warner
    (1717-1801) in East Haddam, CT, and immediately enlisted in the 7th
    Connecticut Regiment in June 1777. The regiment fought in the Battles of
    Brandywine and Germantown that summer, contesting with the British over the
    possession of Philadelphia. Brister died in the service on 11 January 1778.
    Three years later, his former master successfully asked to receive the dead
    soldier's back pay--as seen in these documents. <br><br>These documents
    begin with testimony from the selectmen of the town of East Haddam, CT on 19
    April 1781: "Daniel Warner's Negro man named Brister of East Haddam served
    in the Seventh Battalion in the Connecticutt Line of Continental Troops
    untill his death, being inlisted for three years. The said Brister had his
    freedom from his said master, but was not made free by any law of this
    state, but his said master stood accountable for his maintenance in case he
    had ever come to want." On the back, on 14 June 1781, Warner asks the
    selectmen to submit an order to the state "for the sum that shall be found
    to be due for the within named Brister's service as a soldier." <br><br>The
    second document is a receipt signed the next day by Warner's agent Robert
    Hungerford to the Pay Table Committee for "the payment of eight pounds,
    three shillings, & two pence [to] Daniel Warner, master & owner of a Negro
    man named Bristol."

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    In the late 18th century, a British trading company established a trading
    post in a remote location in Spanish-held western Florida, which attracted a
    small community of refugees from slavery, as well as Seminoles and Choctaws.
    During the War of 1812, the British army took control of the post from
    trader John Forbes in 1814, hoping to use it as a base for an attack on the
    American South. They formed many of the refugees into a Corps of Colonial
    Marines. A British fort offering a destination for escaped slaves, and
    arming them--this made Southern planters rather nervous. <br><br>Offered
    here is a written summary of a verbal report by a member of the Apalachicola
    tribe named Micco, who was sent by Americans as a "confidential man" to spy
    on British activities along the Apalachicola River in Florida. He began his
    journey by land along the west bank of the Chattahoochee River in what is
    now Alabama. Moving into ostensibly neutral Spanish-held Florida, about two
    miles below the confluence with the Flint River where it becomes the
    Apalachicola River, he discovered a small outpost: "20 white and 40 black
    soldiers . . . at the little old field where the commissioners of limits
    encamped. One officer commanded in British uniform. The Blacks were in blue.
    They had no fort or ditch. The Oheteyoconulges built them one house, and
    were to build another." <br><br>Mecco continued down the west bank, crossing
    about 25 miles below the fork at the property of Jack Mealey's and then
    another 50 miles along the east bank to the former Forbes & Company flour
    mill or trading post, which the British were developing into Fort Gadsden.
    There he saw "about 30 white soldiers at Forbes's stores and 60 black
    soldiers . . . they have four cannon and mortars about 7 inch, two feet
    long, fixed on carriage with two low wheels, the store surrounded with a
    ditch. About 200 hostile Indians. He saw a number of black women and
    children at the stores, the men were all soldiers." At the store he learned
    that "the Miccosookee people brought 3 skalps the day before he got to the
    store. Tuckwikee commanded the party and got the scalps near St. Illos. They
    were men's scalps and killed on horse back. He saw a large supply of goods,
    arms and ammunition of good quality for the Indians." <br><br>At the end of
    the War of 1812, soon after this report, the British abandoned the fort.
    However, as a sort of parting gift to the Americans, they left behind a
    large store of arms and ammunition, and encouraged the all-Black Corps of
    Colonial Marines to remain and defend the site. It then became more widely
    known as Negro Fort, and its existence helped spark the Seminole War to
    subdue Florida. In the 1816 Battle of Negro Fort, General Andrew Jackson
    managed to destroy the fort by lobbing a heated cannon ball into the powder
    magazine, killing hundreds.

  at-a-glance: 'Pottsville, PA, [1863]'
  TYPESET: >-
    Albumen photograph, 3½ x 2 inches, on original photographer's mount with
    caption "Nick Biddle of Pottsville, Pa., the first man wounded in the Great
    American Rebellion, Baltimore, April 18, 1861"; corners and top edge cropped
    with minimal loss to photograph.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Nick Biddle (1796-1876) was born into slavery in Delaware, and after
    obtaining his freedom lived for many years in Pottsville, PA. There he
    became an unofficial member of the local militia company, as the personal
    servant of Captain James Wren (1825-1901). After the fall of Fort Sumter,
    the Pottsville men were one of one of 5 Pennsylvania militia companies
    summoned to provide emergency protection to the nation's capital, including
    the 65-year-old Biddle. Although not allowed to formally join the army
    because of his race, Biddle wore the company's uniform. <br><br>Passing
    through Baltimore on the way to Washington on 18 April, the 475 "First
    Defenders" were met by an angry mob of secessionists. Biddle, as a Black man
    in uniform, was the particular target of hostilities. A brick hit him in the
    head, sharply enough to expose the bone. The Baltimore police were barely
    able to protect the soldiers from the insurrectionists and get them on the
    train. In Washington, they were personally greeted by President Lincoln, who
    noticed Biddle's blood-soaked head bandage and encouraged him to get medical
    attention. Biddle instead stayed with his unit. <br><br>With the war
    underway, Biddle soon returned to Pottsville to recuperate, ineligible to
    serve formally in the Army because of both his age and race. This portrait
    was taken in November 1863 by Pottsville photographer W.R. Mortimer to raise
    funds for Biddle's support. The Lancaster Express on 23 November 1863
    announced that a copy was sent to President Lincoln. <br><br>Biddle's claim
    to be the first man wounded in the war is dependent on whether you include
    the evacuation of Fort Sumter the previous week, when six men were badly
    wounded by a powder explosion during a final salute to the American
    flag--technically friendly fire. Several other Pennsylvania "First
    Defenders" were wounded alongside Biddle on 18 April, but he is generally
    given precedence as the first. The more famous death of Colonel Elmer
    Ellsworth in Alexandria, VA was more than a month later. Biddle was almost
    certainly the first Black man in uniform with the Union Army during the
    Civil War.

    As shown in these documents, William Howard (circa 1835-1864) was an
    enslaved laborer owned by the recently widowed Priscilla Ann (Jessup)
    Daugherty (1825-1906) of Baltimore. She manumitted him on 1 April 1864
    directly into the service of the 30th United States Colored Infantry,
    Company I. The Emancipation Proclamation did not cover the enslaved of the
    northern states, although Maryland slaveowners like Daugherty could probably
    see the writing on the wall for the institution's future prospects. She
    apparently received compensation for Howard's enlistment, which is more than
    she would have received under emancipation. This lot includes:
    <br><br>"Volunteer Descriptive List" form documenting Howard's enlistment,

    that Daugherty acquired Howard as her "slave for life" by inheritance in
    1858, with supporting statements by two witnesses, 4 pages including docket.
    <br><br>3 conjoined forms signed by Dougherty: a "Claimant's Certificate"
    claiming her right to compensation for Howard's enlistment; her "Oath of
    Allegiance" to the United States signed by Daugherty, to demonstrate her
    eligibility to receive compensation; and her pledge to file a Deed of
    Manumission, all dated 1 April 1864, 3 pages on one folding sheet.
    <br><br>"Deed of Manumission and Release of Service" (true copy of original

    Howard enjoyed almost 8 months of freedom in 1864, all of it spent in the
    Army. Records show that on 24 November, while his regiment served in the
    Siege of Petersburg, he died in his tent--perhaps by an artillery shell.

    Correspondence of an officer of the 14th R.I. Heavy Artillery Regiment
    (Colored).
  at-a-glance: 'Louisiana, January to June 1864 (letters)'
  TYPESET: >-
    17 Autograph Letters Signed to sister Julia Ann Barney (1846-1912) of
    Leonard's Corner [East Providence], RI, and 2 pieces of ephemera sleeved in
    one binder; minor wear; all but one of the letters with original stamped
    envelopes bearing New Orleans postmark.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    These letters were written by an officer in the 14th Rhode Island Heavy
    Artillery, later known as the 11th United States Colored Heavy Artillery,
    which spent the war in Louisiana. Caleb Henry Barney (1844-1904) of East
    Providence, RI served as a first lieutenant and adjutant with the regiment's
    second battalion from December 1863 to October 1865, which was mainly
    stationed at Plaquemine on the Mississippi northwest of New Orleans, just
    south of Baton Rouge. His letters include interesting commentary on the
    regiment's Black troops, and on the newly freed men and women of Louisiana.
    <br><br>On arriving in Louisiana on 21 February 1864, he boasts that "we
    can't be beat much, by any body of troops with the same experience. Our
    dress parades, particularly, are very fine." By 31 March, he notes that "The
    people of this place are altering their opinion of colored soldiers very
    much since they have had an opportunity to see that they know how to behave
    themselves as well as white men." The battalion saw the passenger steamer
    J.H. Russell burning on the river, and made themselves useful in the
    community: "We turned out a large detail immediately and they went to work
    saving the cattle, hogs, and mules which were aboard." On 25 April, waiting
    for a rebel attack, he hopes "we shall have a little brush, just to show the
    people of this secesh town that 'niggers' will fight." He also comments on
    the scandalous mistreatment of his troops, who were (like all of the Colored
    Troops) receiving unequal pay: "The paymaster was here last week to pay the
    men, but they declined, preferring to wait until Congress shall pass the
    bill making their pay the same as that of white troops. This is what they
    were promised when they enlisted." <br><br>On the local freedmen, he notes
    on 21 February that "slavery is dead anyhow, and a system of compensated
    labor is being established, the planters being required to pay so much per
    month to every hand employed by them, & the negroes are allowed to choose
    their own masters." An important order by the military government was noted
    on 4 June: "There is an order from Gen. Banks that all negroes who have been
    living together as man and wife, but who were only married by jumping over
    the broomstick, etc., must now be legally married by the provost marshals of
    the several parishes, and are to have a certificate of their marriage, same
    as white folks. There will consequently be a large number of marriage
    ceremonies during the ensuing summer." The letters end in June 1864,
    although Barney remained with the regiment until they were mustered out in
    October 1865. A more detailed summary of his letters is available upon
    request. <br><br>Included with the letters are two other items. One is a
    manuscript mock newspaper titled "Roanoke Press," written by Barney for his
    family on 22 February 1862 while he was with the 5th Rhode Island Infantry.
    He describes a scouting party which discovered a "negro woman with a huge
    whiskey bottle in her hand" who fled from them "as fast as her legs could
    carry her." Also included is a 27 September 1864 broadside playbill for
    "Grand Vocal and Instrumental Concert on Board the U.S.S. Argosy," a patrol
    boat which was based on the Mississippi south of Plaquemines. It was
    apparently a minstrel show given by 9 performers including "Master Lon, the
    Young American Excelsior Jig Dancer."

    3 Autograph Letters Signed to Ellen Gamble Paul, each 4 pages, 9¾ x 7½

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    "They are by far the best workmen."<br><br>While fighting regiments like the
    54th Massachusetts got all the glory, most regiments of Colored Troops
    worked on essential but thoroughly unglamorous engineering projects. These 3
    letters offer a bit of insight into life in these regiments. Robert Spencer
    Paul writes from Cincinnati on 14 September 1862 about his brother Harrison
    Daniel Paul (1835-1906), a white civilian engineer supervising the
    construction of forts near Cincinnati: "Harry has the Black brigade under
    him now. Tom Peters has one half and Harry the other, giving each 600
    Negroes. They are by far the best workmen. Harry and Tom Peters' works are
    by far the best constructed of any along the whole line. . . . Harry has had
    2 forts to construct, while none of the others have more than one. Harry
    eats with the Black brigade, and the cooks of the Negro co that he messes
    with were getting $100 a month a piece as cooks before they went to the
    fortifications. They do get things up in good style. The white cooks in the
    camp around are too dirty to eat after. In Harry's division there are 300 to
    500 Negroes chopping all the time, and they will chop more than 3 city white
    men. They are a good-natured jolly set, more than half mulattoes, pretty
    smart fellows." <br><br>Also included are two letters from their father
    Hosea Paul (1809-1870), a surveyor who supervised military road-building
    projects. On 2 January 1864 he wrote from Big Hill in Madison County in
    central Kentucky: "I suppose we shall have something over 100 impressed
    Negroes the first of next week." On 29 January he was 10 miles further south
    in Rockcastle County: "When I came here the military supt . . . promised the
    Negroes of Fayette, Montgomery, Madison & Nicholas Counties, probably 150
    from each co., instead of which only 70 have come from Madison & none from
    any other county. The overseers . . . are undoubtedly selected because they
    are the most ignorant men on the subject of road making in the county. . . .
    I start in the morning & ride 1½ miles to the first gang & then 2½ miles
    further to the 2nd, where I get my dinner & return in season for supper."

    4 Autograph Letters Signed by Lieutenant Theodore Vaill to various family
    members. 9 pages in total, various sizes; folds and minimal wear. One letter
    with original stamped envelope bearing Alexandria postmark.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The author of these letters, Theodore Frelinghuysen Vaill (1832-1875), was a
    white lieutenant in the 2nd Connecticut Heavy Artillery from an affluent
    family. He served in various Virginia campaigns through the course of the
    war. He came into frequent contact with refugee "contrabands" who had
    escaped from slavery, and like many officers, hired one as his personal
    servant. These four letters all discuss his efforts to bring some of these
    refugees back north to Litchfield, CT, where they could find employment at
    his family's estate or with trusted neighbors. <br><br>The earliest letter
    offered here is dated 23 October 1863, where he writes: "Willie is doing
    very well. If you wanted a colored boy to raise, I could send you one, who
    would be worth 40 Irvings." The other three letters are from after the
    conclusion of fighting, while Vaill awaited discharge at Fort Ethan Allen
    near Arlington, VA. In 28 June 1865 letter to his brother Joe, he adds in a
    postscript "Has my colored boy arrived?" He wrote at greater length to his
    brother Charles on 8 July 1865: "To the folks at Litchfield, I have a first
    rate colored boy named Leander. He has been with me ever since I returned to
    the reg't & I know him to be a good boy, faithful & likely, about 16 or 17
    yrs old. He wants me to take him home. Shall I do so, for you or some
    neighbor? Please write and let me know." Finally, on 27 July 1865, he wrote
    to his father: "I cannot send a boy to Mr. Dudley. . . . I don't want to
    promise to let him have my boy Leander, because I think he will be very
    valuable to keep at the manse. He is the embodiment of faithfulness, and he
    and Jack will be none too much help. Leander can wash & do any kind of
    indoor work, such as generally allotted to the women folks in New England,
    and which breaks them down & kills them. He can make his own bed, do his own
    (& other peoples') washing, &c &c. . . . I shan't look up any colored folks
    for Lewis Kilbourn & Amos Bissell unless they write me & let me know what
    they want." We do not know if Leander ever made it to Connecticut, but we
    can find no record of him in Connecticut in the 1870 census.

    man named Robert Young, who wrote six of his addresses in the book, adding
    "Please don't forget to return this book" and "Please return this book,
    thanx." He can be traced through draft registration records, the 1940 census
    for Los Angeles, and the city directories for Santa Barbara, California at
    these addresses from 1949 to 1978. His full name was Robert Bruce Young
    (1894-circa 1980), and he worked as a chauffeur, shipping clerk, porter, and
    custodian. We can safely infer that this rare book was one of his most
    treasured possessions, but that he occasionally shared Lieutenant Flipper's
    remarkable story with trusted friends.

    In the segregated navy of the 1940s, Blacks were almost entirely restricted
    to service as mess attendants. When Pearl Harbor was attacked on 7 December
    1941, one of the messmen on the USS West Virginia was Doris "Dorie" Miller.
    While the ship was under fire from the surprise attack, Miller carried a
    wounded officer from the deck, and then without any training took a position
    behind one of the ship's anti-aircraft guns. As he described it later, "It
    wasn't hard. I just pulled the trigger and she worked fine. I had watched
    the others with these guns. I guess I fired her for about fifteen minutes. I
    think I got one of those Jap planes. They were diving pretty close to us."
    <br><br>Once his identity became known, Miller received a Distinguished
    Service Cross, but after lobbying by the nation's Black press, he was
    awarded the yet more prestigious Navy Cross in May 1942. He died in the line
    of duty in November 1943. <br><br>The artist was David Stone Martin, who was

    The 92nd Infantry Division was formed in 1917, and reactivated as a

    the division followed them to Italy on 22 September, just 3 weeks after this
    newspaper was published. They were the only Black infantry division to see
    combat in the European theater. <br><br>This newspaper issue reports proudly
    on the combat team's first engagement, with a headline reading "C.T. Battles
    Nazis at Arno," and a page 2 editorial: "Since the announcement from Italy
    and General Clark's speech accepting the 92d Combat Team as a battle unit,
    all of us have been busting brass buttons with pride." Also included are a

    The "Yale Sweeps" were Yale University's all-Black custodial force in the
    19th century, with a place in college lore, and often occupying a
    substantial position in the local community due to their connection with the
    school. Of the men shown here, Carter Wright was the son of an A.M.E.
    minister who had served as a chaplain in the Civil War. George T. Livingston
    had served in the 29th Connecticut Infantry during the war, was active in
    Republican politics, and served as a deacon of his church. See Charles E.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    A collection of short biographies of formerly enslaved people, compiled by a
    white woman from Columbus, OH with strong Southern sympathies. The book is
    "illustrated from photographs made by the author in the cabins and on the
    plantations." The foreword summarizes her editorial viewpoint: "Thousands of
    negroes, though slaves no longer, lingered with their former masters,
    working for them and sharing their misfortunes. The freedom the war had
    brought to them was not of their seeking. . . . They chose to stay with
    those whom they had come to know as friends and protectors. They stayed and
    served with fidelity . . . and in turn were treated with the kindness,
    affection and justice that are characteristic of the Southern people."
    Although the book is essentially Confederate Lost Cause propaganda, and the
    narrative is heavily skewed toward nostalgia, the portraits and biographies
    may still have some historical value. None at auction since 2005.

    On the 4th of July, the Black community of Raleigh, NC celebrated their
    first Independence Day as freedmen (just weeks after the original Juneteenth
    in Texas). About 3,000 marched with banners. As the New York Times reported
    on 14 July 1865, "the disenthralled slaves enjoyed a celebration of this
    glorious day, following a programme of their own making, and listening to
    speakers of their own selection." The Union soldiers who had remained to
    enforce the peace were asked to stay in camp, to avoid disturbing the
    celebration. The idea of free Blacks enjoying the holiday while he was stuck
    in camp was deeply offensive to this particular white Union soldier, who
    contemplated armed resistance: <br><br>"I will tell you about the 4 of July.
    It was salurbrated mostly by the Negrows. The streets were blacker than a
    thundercloud. They had such a time as you might supose that the Negrows get

    Peters Jr. (1780-1848) then bought the property at a public auction for
    $350. This document thus officially deeds the land to Peters, who was a
    well-connected white Philadelphia attorney. His father had served in the
    Continental Congress, and he was appointed as solicitor of Philadelphia
    County in the same year as this deed. How exactly the church came to owe him
    that large sum of money, or what he did with the seized church property, we
    do not know.

    The Church of God and Saints of Christ was founded by William Saunders
    Crowdy in Philadelphia in 1899, and moved to Washington, DC in 1903. They
    were one of the first Black Israelite congregations in the country,
    professing a direct link to Judaism as well as a devotion to the teachings
    of Christ. The church remains active with 50 tabernacles today. This

    First edition. Sacred harp singing is a genre of vocal music which features
    hymns sung in four-part harmony, written in shape notes. It originated in
    New England and was first popularized by the 1844 publication of The Sacred
    Harp; it soon migrated to the South. The music is not generally performed at
    concerts or church services, but at regular participatory "singings." Judge
    Jackson (1883-1958) was raised in Alabama, where as his son recalled "the
    only sacred harp singers in Montgomery County were whites." He moved as a
    young man to Ozark in southeastern Alabama, where he became a sacred harp
    singer and helped form the Dale County Colored Music Institute. He led the
    committee to write this new volume of sacred harp music. Each of the dozens
    of songs are attributed to an author with its composition date. Many are
    written by Judge Jackson, and he edited the remainder; most of the dates
    range from 1929 to 1932. The frontispiece urges: "We ask your co-operation
    both White and Colored to help us place this book in every home. That we may
    learn thousands of people especially the youth how to praise God in
    singing." The songs had an extended life, with a revival sparked by the 1970
    formation of the Wiregrass Sacred Harp Singers and the 1973 publication of a
    second edition (featuring a "History of the Colored Sacred Harp"). Further
    editions followed in 1992 and 2004; singings continued in Ozark through at
    least 2009. We trace no other examples of this 1934 first edition at

    (see Swann's 30 March 2017 sale, lot 227), which included important work by
    W.E.B. Du Bois and Ida Wells-Barnett. Burt Green Wilder (1841-1909) was a
    white neurologist at Cornell University with a personal interest in the
    subject of race relations, as he had spent the Civil War years as the
    surgeon of the 55th Massachusetts Infantry (brother regiment to the 54th
    Massachusetts of Glory fame). Most of this article is a scientific effort to
    address the question: "Do any physical characteristics of the brain of the
    American Negro warrant discrimination against him?" He concludes "There has
    been found no constant feature by which the Negro brain may certainly be
    distinguished from that of a Caucasian, whereas either of them is at once
    distinguishable from the brain of an ape" (page 40). Numerous illustrations
    of brains are included to underscore his point. The article then takes an
    unexpected turn with a section titled "American Negroes in the Civil War,"
    drawing on his personal war experience as evidence that the soldiers of the
    55th Massachusetts exhibited "as high a kind of moral courage as has been
    chronicled in the history of the world."

  CROSSHEAD: The earliest known images of Black baseball players in action.
  at-a-glance: 'Rochester, NY, images circa 1871'
  TYPESET: >-
    4 stereoview photographs, each with a pair of matched 3 x 2¾-inch albumen
    photographs mounted on original 3¼ x 7-inch mounts with photographer's
    backmark and inventory list on verso; minor wear and foxing, additional
    manuscript captions on verso.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    These photographs show an integrated group of young baseball players at the
    Western House of Refuge, a reform school in Rochester, NY. Taken circa 1871,
    they are thought to be the earliest photographs of Black baseball players in
    action. <br><br>The four photographs all show ballplayers at the school. One
    was taken from just behind the catcher, close enough to see the faces of
    several of the boys--in the field, at bat, running bases, or reclining while
    waiting their turn at bat. The teams were apparently integrated. A
    substantial crowd including the House of Refuge band can be seen in the
    background. Another photo captioned "North Wing" is taken from high above
    the field, showing a game in progress, again with the band standing in
    shallow right field. A similar view captioned "South Wing" is taken
    simultaneously to show another game in progress on the school's second field
    (a full panorama of both fields has been seen in carte-de-visite form).
    Finally, another shot captioned "Gymnasium & Base Ball Boys" shows about
    thirty uniformed ballplayers posed around an array of outdoor exercise
    equipment, many of them holding or seated upon bats. <br><br>The images were
    originally shot in this stereo form, with infinitesimally different
    perspectives in the two facing images which would appear three-dimensional
    when seen through a special viewer. Halves of at least some of these images
    were also published as smaller cartes-de-visite. Mark Rucker, the leading
    scholar of early baseball photographs, reproduces two of these images in
    carte-de-visite form in his 1988 book "Baseball Cartes: The First Baseball
    Cards" as plate 58, describing it as "the first photo of Blacks playing
    ball. . . . Game action CDVs are rare, and this is the ultimate."
    <br><br>Rucker placed the date of these photographs as circa 1874. However,
    other examples of these views have been found with the series title "Views
    of the Western House of Refuge, Rochester N.Y. by Bacon & Carnall." This
    short-lived partnership appears in the Rochester city directories only in
    1871, suggesting that the photographs were originally taken by that date.
    Franklin Wright Bacon (1819-1901) soon went into business on his own account
    at the same address, and continued publishing these views under the present
    "Views in Rochester and Vicinity" series title, as seen on the present
    examples. His firm became Franklin W. Bacon & Co. in the mid-1880s, so it
    would appear these prints were produced circa 1872 to 1885 from circa 1871
    negatives. <br><br>The Western House of Refuge had several different
    baseball clubs, complete with their own uniforms. In the close-up of the
    game in progress, a team wearing an "A" on their uniforms is in the field,
    while one of the reclining boys in the foreground can be seen with a
    stylized spider on his uniform. The two distant views of games in progress
    both seem to show players wearing the "A." The boys at the gymnasium are
    wearing three separate uniforms: "B," "R" and the same "A's" as in the
    ballgame. The House of Refuge baseball games were sometimes covered in the
    Rochester Democrat and Chronicle from this era; a team called the Spiders
    hosted a local youth team at the House (18 October 1871), and box scores
    were recorded for games for teams called the Excelsiors (15 May 1875) and
    Blue Stockings (3 August 1875), who had largely overlapping players. The
    Western House of Refuge was located on Backus Street in the northwestern
    part of Rochester. The school was closed in 1902, and the building is long
    since gone; the Edgerton Recreation Center is at the site today.

    Cabinet card of Dan Penno, a pre-Negro League player from the famed Cuban
    Giants.
  at-a-glance: 'New York, 1901'
  TYPESET: >-
    Silver print, 5¼ x 3¾ inches, on photographer's mount of "The Gem," 495 6th
    Avenue, New York; minimal wear, mount remnants on verso; contemporary
    inscription on verso "From Daniel E. Penno, August 21th 1901."
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Dan Penno was one of only two Black players who did long stints in Rhode
    Island's integrated semi-professional baseball teams in the nineteenth
    century, playing with various local teams from 1883 to 1890, before joining
    the well-known Cuban Giants of New York from 1893 to 1898, and continuing
    with New York-area teams through at least 1906. This portrait was taken
    toward the end of his playing career, when he was about 40 years old. We
    don't see many portraits of pre-Negro League players, in or out of uniform.
    <br><br>You will not find much information on Daniel Eugene Penno in any
    standard reference sources, but one of the world's leading experts is by a
    fortunate coincidence employed at Swann Galleries. Penno was born in East
    Greenwich, RI circa 1861, the son of an illiterate Cape Verdean mariner
    named John Penno and a local mulatto named Hannah Perry. The Cape Verdeans,
    descended from a mix of Portuguese settlers and enslaved Africans on a small
    island hundreds of miles off the coast of Africa, had a long tradition of
    settlement in Rhode Island. Dan married young in 1879 to Ella Maria Proffit,
    a member of one of Rhode Island's most notable Black families. One modern
    source states that he attended Howard University, although he is not listed
    in Howard's annual catalogs from 1878 to 1883. His earliest documented
    baseball appearance was in 1883 as a catcher for the Yellow Docks, an
    integrated team from the mill village of Pontiac, RI. He pitched for the
    1885 Acmes in Providence, and went on to play with the white East Greenwich
    Alerts as well as the Providence Colored Grays in 1886. His older brother
    Louis was his catcher with the Colored Grays. He joined the all-Black Boston
    Resolutes in 1887 as an infielder, was back with the Providence Colored
    Grays in 1888, and was playing with a white semi-pro team in the village of
    Pascoag, RI in 1889. In 1890, he was playing for the Clydes of Pawtuxet
    Valley in the Rhode Island State League, covering center field, shortstop,
    and third base. Integrated teams were rare in Rhode Island in the late
    1800s, but not unheard of; star pitcher William Whyte was another noteworthy
    Black player in the same circuit during this period. <br><br>In 1892, Penno
    was listed as a laborer in the industrial village of River Point, RI, but
    the next year, he was the starting center fielder for the 1893 Cuban Giants,
    alongside great pre-Negro League stars such as Hall of Famers Frank Grant
    and Sol White. The team went 99-12 that year, and played regular Sunday
    games at Leo Park in Queens County. On 31 August 1896, Penno and some of his
    teammates were arrested for playing Sunday baseball in Long Island City,
    NY--a common occupational hazard for ballplayers of all races in that era.
    He was with the Cuban Giants as late as 1898. In later years, he was spotted
    with the "Genuine Cuban Giants" in 1901, the Jersey Cubans in 1902, and with
    the New York Colored Giants from 1904 to at least 1906. He was never a star,
    but was good enough to play at least semi-professionally for more than
    twenty years, including some stints with very good teams. He remained in
    Manhattan after his playing career. In the 1920 census, he was living on
    131st Street and working as a porter in Grand Central Station. He died in
    Manhattan on 25 July 1924.

    This game marked the end of segregated high school football in the District
    of Columbia. At the conclusion of the regular season, a public high school
    all-star team faced off against St. John's, an elite all-white private
    Catholic school. Court-mandated integration had begun that year, but had not
    yet reached the football teams; both white and black players later recalled
    never having even attended an integrated practice before. The biggest future
    star was one of the black players, Willie Wood, a junior at Armstrong High,
    who went on to star for the Green Bay Packers and was inducted into the
    Football Hall of Fame. However, he was not the star of the game. With six
    minutes remaining, white tailback Dan Droze connected with black tight end
    Dave Harris for a touchdown, and the public school kids won 12-7. The
    program contains rosters and team photos for both teams. See Dave McKenna,

    Ida B. Jefferson (born circa 1875) was an Ohio-born faith healer and

    an A.M.E. minister in Gregg County, TX. The Dallas Express of 27 November
    1920 described her as a resident of Longview, TX and added that "this noble
    woman can cure you of any disease, no matter how bad the case is." She ran
    illustrated ads across the country for her healing services and her hair
    restorer from 1920 to 1923. She was divorced in Los Angeles in 1924, and no
    later reference has been found. This card would appear to be much earlier

    Third edition, greatly expanded. Bessie M. Gant (circa 1902-1962) was also
    known for her weekly Pittsburgh Courier column, "Bess' Secrets 'bout Good
    Things to Eat," which ran from 1939 to 1956. After years as a private chef
    and restaurateur in Chicago and Pittsburgh, she moved to Los Angeles and
    became known as a chef to the stars. The last 5 pages of this cookbook are
    devoted to "Favorite Recipes of Famous Personalities," including a chicken
    mousse with avocados favored by Lena Horne, butterscotch pears for Hattie
    McDaniel, and other recipes for Walt Disney, Katherine Hepburn, Carmen
    Miranda, and more. The first two editions of her cookbook came out in 1938
    and 1940, and are quite scarce (none of the 1938 and 2 of the 1940 in
    OCLC).

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    In August 1974, Joan Little was serving a sentence at Beaufort County Jail
    in North Carolina. A notoriously predatory prison guard attempted to rape
    her, and she stabbed him to death with an ice pick. Facing the death
    penalty, her case became a national cause at the intersection of the
    feminist, racial justice, and prison reform movements. Rosa Parks and the
    local Black Panther Party chapter were among the thousands who worked in her
    defense. In August 1975, she became the first woman in American history to
    be acquitted of murder in self-defense against sexual assault. None traced
    at auction.

    illustrated with a portrait of Bethune, lightly stamped "901" on back; light
    tape stains across front and sides, other minor wear.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The fund was launched circa 1960 to build a monument to the great educator
    and activist Mary McLeod Bethune (1875-1955); the National Council of Negro
    Women left the 1318 Vermont Avenue headquarters noted here circa 1965. The
    statue was unveiled by the Council in Washington in 1974, and was the first
    on public land in the capital to honor a Black American or a woman. It is
    emblazoned with the same words seen on one side of this donation box: "I
    leave you love. I leave you hope. I leave you the challenge of developing
    confidence in one another. I leave you a thirst for education. I leave you a
    respect for the use of power. I leave you faith. I leave you racial dignity.
    I leave you a desire to live harmoniously with your fellow men. I leave you,
    finally, a responsibility to our young people."

  CROSSHEAD: 'A Voice from the South, by a Black Woman of the South.'
  at-a-glance: 'Xenia, OH, 1892'
  TYPESET: >-
    Frontispiece portrait. [4], 304 pages. 8vo, original two-toned publisher's
    gilt cloth, moderate wear, rear joint splitting; hinges split, inscribed on
    the title page "Harvey Ray, Kind regards of the author, June 10, 1910."
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Anna Julia Haywood Cooper (1858-1964) was born into slavery, spent her early
    years in Raleigh, NC, graduated from Oberlin College in 1884, and earned a
    master's degree in mathematics there four years later--one of the first two
    Black women in America to earn the M.A. She moved to Washington, where she
    helped found the Colored Women's League. "A Voice from the South," her first
    book, was an important early expression of Black feminism, arguing that
    womanhood was "a vital element in the regeneration and progress of a race,"
    and that higher education was the means of reaching that goal.
    <br><br>Cooper received her doctorate degree from the Sorbonne in Paris in
    1924, at the age of 66--and lived for another four decades. Afro-Americana
