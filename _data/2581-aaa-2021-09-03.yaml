  DESCRIPT: HENRY OSSAWA TANNER (1859 - 1937)
  CROSSHEAD: Head of a Sheep.
  year: '1880'
  TYPESET: >-
    Oil on canvas, mounted on board, circa 1880-81. 248x229 mm; 9¾x9 inches.
    Signed in oil, lower left.<br><br>Provenance: the estate of the artist, with
    estate blue ink stamp and the ink signature of Jesse O. Tanner, on the frame
    back; Grand Central Art Galleries, New York, with the label on the frame
    back; the artist Harry Andrew Jackson; thence by descent, private
    collection, Wyoming.<br><br>Tanner painted <i>Head of a Sheep</i> early in
    his studies at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts when he seized on
    the speciality of painting animals. With the support of his parents and
    inspiration from the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition, Henry Ossawa Tanner
    enrolled at the Academy in December of 1879. A year later he began life
    drawing classes under the tutelage of Thomas Eakins. After an interest in
    maritime painting, Tanner settled on painting animal subjects, with his
    stated desire "to become an American Landseer." According to Anna O. Marley,
    "Tanner was so devoted to animal painting that he bought a sheep to serve as
    a model for his pastoral compositions." This small study has clear ties in
    subject to Tanner's 1881 <i>Boy and Sheep Under a Tree</I>. But its bold
    passages of painterly brushwork are closer to his naturalist study of lions,
    <i>Pomp at the Zoo</i>, circa 1880, and <i>Lion Licking its Paw</i>, 1886.

    H. King, Jr. <i>Edward M. Bannister 1828 - 1901: A Centennial
    Retrospective</i>, p. 23.<br><br>This landscape is an excellent example of
    Edward M. Bannister's mature landscape painting, representing both the
    natural beauty of rural Rhode Island and man's place in it. Bannister began
    to explore more atmospheric and tonal painterly effects in his late 1880s
    and early 1890s landscapes. His <i>Crossing the Bridge Before Sunset<i>
    displays a beautiful overall golden hue and painterliness; the fading light
    of the day, filtered through an atmospheric sky, traverses a rich and
    verdant countryside. Bannister draws the viewer into the scene by placing
    the horse drawn cart moving into the center of the composition.

    Atlanta; private collection, New York.<br><br>This charming nautical scene
    is a wonderful and scarce example of the painting of early Chicago artist
    James Bolivar Needham. Painted on the scene, these small paintings are
    Needham's immediate observations from the city's lakeside docks. Needham was
    born in Chatham, Ontario, Canada, a terminus point of the Underground
    Railroad. He left at the age of 14 and worked his way to Chicago on lumber
    schooners, via Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. His brother Will Needham
    recalled that he spent some time at the Chicago Art Institute - yet there
    are no records to support this claim. Needham has only had one documented
    exhibition - in a Central Art Association show in 1895. He worked in
    obscurity throughout his lifetime. A retrospective was held at Robert Henry
    Adams Fine Art, Chicago, February 28 - March 20, 1998, and several of his
    paintings from the collection of the Chicago Historical Society were
    included in the 2004 exhibition <i>Chicago Modern 1893 - 1945</i> at the
    Terra Museum of American Art, Chicago. Schulman pp. 132-34.

    collection, Decatur, IL (circa 1922), thence by descent, private collection,
    VA. The owner's great grandmother acquired this painting from the Harper
    family in Decatur. A number of oil paintings by William A. Harper were
    exhibited at the Decatur Art Institute in January of 1922 .<br><br>William
    A. Harper likely painted this beautiful landscape on his second trip to
    Paris when he studied with Henry Ossawa Tanner. Like landscape painters
    Edward M. Bannister and James Bolivar Needham, William Harper was also born
    in Canada. His family moved from Cayuga to Illinois in 1885, and Harper
    attended the Art Institute of Chicago from 1895-1901, working as a night
    watchman and janitor to pay for his tuition. He studied in Paris first from
    1903-1905 at the Académie Julian like Tanner. In 1905, the talented Harper
    earned the Municipal Art League's blue ribbon at the Art Institute of
    Chicago for nine of his paintings. Harper's career was cut short when he
    died of tuberculosis only a few years later at the age of 36. The Art
    Institute held a memorial exhibition in Harper's honor, showcasing 60 of his
    works. His paintings are found today in the collections of the Metropolitan
    Museum of Art, the National Gallery, the Smithsonian American National
    Museum of African American History and Culture, the Tuskegee University and
    Dr. Walter O. Evans.<br><br>Thank you to Janet Nussbaum for her assistance

  TYPESET: >-
    Bronze with a dark brown patina, modeled in 1935, cast circa 1960.
    Approximately 483 mm; 19 inches high (not including the marble base). Cast
    by the Modern Art Foundry, Long Island City, NY. Signed at the base
    edge.<br><br>Provenance: the artist; Samella Lewis, Los Angeles; Dr. Linda
    F. Rankin, New Jersey (1988); William Watson Hines III, thence by descent,
    private collection, New Jersey. Hines was a business writer, art dealer and
    collector who lent many works from his collection to the Art In Embassies
    Program of the US State Department.<br><br>Illustrated: Cedric Dover.
    <i>American Negro Art</i>, plate 70 (another impression).<br><br><i>Feral
    Benga</i> represents the culmination of Richmond Barthé's study of the
    figure in sculpture, anatomy and dance in the 1930s, and his pioneering
    realization of an ideal male nude. According to Barthé scholar Margaret Rose
    Vendryes, <i>Feral Benga</i>, Barthé's "signature piece," was completed
    within a few months of seeing the Folies Bergères dancer Benga perform on
    stage during his first visit to Paris in 1934. Vendryes describes how Benga
    was an exotic celebrity--a Senegalese cabaret dancer known in Parisian and
    Manhattan gay circles, who had perfomed on stage with Josephine Baker and
    had even appeared in a Jean Cocteau surrealist film. Barthé used postcards,
    photographs and his memory to recreate a life-like representation of the
    dancer. The raised sword pose also recalls the muscular nudes of the famous
    Mannerist engraving by Antonio Pollaiuolo, <i>Battle of Naked Men<D>, circa
    1470.<br><br>Grander in scale than its actual size, <i>Feral Benga</i> was
    one ot the artist's major achievements in his life-long body of work, a
    natural and sensual repesentation of the male nude, made at the height of
    his career. The sculpture was first shown at the 1937 <i>Dance
    International<D> exhibition at Rockefeller Center, and was later featured
    and illustrated in Alain Locke's seminal survey, <i>The Negro in Art.</i>The
    figure is also important as a groundbreaking evocation of both male and
    homosexual sexuality in early 20th century American Art.<br><br>Thank you to
    Margaret Vendryes for her assistance with the cataloguing of this cast. This
    is only the second mid-career cast of this bronze sculpture to come to
    auction--there are only two bronzes known to exist from the first 1935
    casting. Under the supervision of the artist and the Richmond Barthé Trust,
    an edition of 10 numbered casts and a small number of artist's proofs of
    <i>Feral Benga</i> were made in 1986. Vendryes pp. 66-69.

    Richmond Barthé is his well known portrait of the Czech-born German dancer
    Harald Kreutzberg (1902 - 1968). Kreutzberg is an important figure in German
    ballet and modern dance whom Richmond Barthé befriended when he performed in
    New York in the 1930s. Barthé made several sculptures of the expressive
    dancer in busts and figures. Barthé himself had studied Martha Graham dance
    techniques in an effort to more fully understand the movement and form of
    dancing figures.<br><br>A plaster cast of this head was exhibited and

    Abraham Lincoln in August of 1863, without an appointment. On the way to the
    White House, Douglass met Samuel C. Pomeroy, a senator from Kansas, who
    introduced him to the President. The artist's typed description reads; "A
    Black Man at the White House. In 1863, during the Civil War, Frederick
    Douglass visited President Lincoln at the White House to ask that Negores be
    enlisted in the Union Army. This resulted in the forming of the two Negro
    regiments, the 54th and the 55th from Boston, Massachusetts. The First Negro
    Soliders in the Union Army."<br><br>This historical scene is an early,
    significant painting by John N. Robinson, a great artist whose work rarely

    excelled at warm depictions of African American friends and family, in
    addition a series of striking self-portraits. Despite a long career and
    museum exhibitions, Robinson's work went largely unheralded outside of
    Washington, DC during his lifetime. Robinson received recognition for his
    painting late in his career with a solo exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery
    of Art in 1976, and a retrospective at the Anacostia Museum and Center for
    African American History and Culture in 1983. His paintings are found today
    in the permanent collections of the National Portrait Gallery, the
    Birmingham Museum of Art, the Anacostia Community Museum, the Smithsonian
    American Art Museum and the Howard University Gallery of Art.

    Fine wrote that in 1943 Lewis won a competition to design a war relief
    poster, and had a supervisory dock job working in Vancouver where he
    encountered fierce discrimination from workers. Upon returning to New York,
    he held a job tending to housing project lawns. Then in the fall, Norman
    Lewis began teaching painting at the new progressive George Washington
    Carver School in Harlem, where he joined an impressive staff, including
    Ernest Crichlow (painting), Charles White (drawing), and Elizabeth Catlett
    (sculpture). Lewis taught there through 1944. Fine p. 252.

    Foundation in New York in 1933. With a grant from the Minneapolis
    philanthropist James Ford Bell, Bannarn moved to New York in 1934. There
    Bannarn and Charles Alston rented the studio which became the Harlem
    Workshop or the "306", a creative center and meeting place for artists,
    musicians and poets. Bannard also taught at the Harlem Community Art Center,
    where he worked alongside Norman Lewis and Charles Alston, and mentored
    Jacob Lawrence.<br><br><i>Rowhouses, Charleston, SC</i> is a scarce example
    of Bannarn's modernist painting made during his wartime service in the US
    Army. Bannarn was inducted around 1940, and his painting skills were soon
    put to use in the Army’s Special Services Division. In Camp Plauche,
    Harahan, Louisiana, he created a series of murals depicting soldiers on
    furlough in various theaters of operation. Later at the Charleston Port of
    Embarkation, South Carolina, he completed murals depicting American soldiers
    on leave around the world, and recruitment and war bond posters, painting
    some of the the first service and support images to depict African American
    soldiers as a fighting men. Bannarn continued to paint his own work at the
    time, and returned to his studio practice in New York in 1949.

    significant, modernist painting by Claude Clark, made during his most
    innovative period as a young artist living in Philadelphia. After winning a
    4 year scholarship to the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art.,
    he was supported by Dr. Albert C. Barnes, who gave him access to his famous
    collection at the Barnes Foundation from 1939-1944.  In 1944, his painting
    <i>Cutting Pattern</i> was just the second art work by an African-American
    artist accepted into the Barnes Foundation, after one by Horace Pippin.
    Clark also was a colleague of Dox Thrash and Rayond Steth in the WPA
    Printmaking Workshop from 1939-1942, where he helped Thrash develop his
    innovative carborundum etching technique. Clark's paintings and prints are
    in many institutional collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
    the Saint Louis Art Museum, the Newark Museum, the Smithsonian Institution,
    and the De Young Museum. Messenger p. 48.

    Incised initials at rear lower edge.<br><br>Provenance: Charles White, New
    York; private collection, New York; thence by descent, private collection,
    New Jersey.<br><br>This impressive carving of a young man's head is an
    important sculpture by Elizabeth Catlett. It is one of only two known stone
    sculptures made by the artist, and the only work from her seminal 1940s
    period whose location is known today. The only other recorded stone work is
    <i>Mother and Child</i>, her 1940 University of Iowa MFA thesis project. The
    35 inch high carving in limestone is now sadly missing from the University's
    collection. In Samella Lewis's monograph, <i>The Art of Elizabeth
    Catlett</i>, Lewis catalogued just two works for the year 1943: "<i>Abstract
    Forms</i>, plaster" and "<i>Head</i>, stone". Catlett primarily worked in
    plaster and terracotta in the late 1930s and 1940s. All four works included
    in her <i>I am the Negro Woman</i> solo exhibition at the Barnett-Aden
    Gallery in 1947, <i>Negro Woman</i>, <i>Tired</i>, <i>Pensive</i> and
    <i>Frustration</i>, were terra cotta.<br><br>Elizabeth Catlett's <i>Head</i>
    stone shows her synthesis of her studies and interest in depicting modern
    African American subjects in the early 1940s. Melanie Herzog describes
    Catlett's education at the University of Iowa, and how in her second year of
    graduate studies, she focused on sculpture - learning several techniques in
    bronze, stone, wood, terra cotta and plaster. But it was <i>Mother and
    Child</i>, the centerpiece of her 1940 thesis project, that crystallized
    many of her interests; as Catlett wrote in her thesis, "stone imposes a
    certain discipline which cannot be ignored." Her work won First Award in
    Sculpture in the 1940 American Negro Exhibition in Chicago, and caught the
    interest of James A. Porter who included an image and description of
    <i>Mother and Child</i> in his 1943 <i>Modern Negro Art</i>. Porter wrote
    "it is a pity that this young woman has had so few opportunities to continue
    her work in stone." In 1942, Herzog describes how after moving to New York,
    Catlett also studied with the French-Russian emigre and modernist sculptor
    Ossip Zadkine - taking private lessons from him that summer, while working
    in terra cotta. Zadkine was also a stone carver, and helped her develop a
    modernist sense of abstraction in her work by simplifying the forms of the
    human figure. <i>Head</i> displays Catlett's emerging modern approach to an
    African-American subjects in the 1940s. Herzog pp. 19-21, 30-34; Porter p.
    132; Lewis p. 188.

    verso.<br><br>Provenance: private collection, New York; Beverly Sacks Fine
    Art, New York, with the gallery label on the frame back; private collection,
    Los Angeles.<br><br>Exhibited: <i>Paintings by Hale Woodruff</i>, Bertha
    Schaefer Gallery, New York, September 15 - October 4, 1958. This was the
    third of Woodruff's solo exhibitions at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery of the
    1950s which established his New York career as a significant abstact
    artist.<br><br>With its gorgeous jewel-like colors and rich painterly
    passages, <i>Carnival</i> is an excellent and important example of Hale
    Woodruff's postwar abstraction, and his largest abstract canvas to come to
    auction.<i>Carnival</i> is part of Woodruff 1950s body of work in which
    describes landscape and natural phenomena within the idiom of Abstract
    Expressionism.<br><br>Not seen publicly in over seventy years, this striking
    canvas shows Woodruff's continued evolution as an abstract painter in the
    postwar period. By the late 1950s, now a Professor of art eduction at New
    York University and an important member of the New York School, Woodruff
    showed more freedom in his approach, in both color and brushwork.
    <i>Carnival</i> is related in palette and composition to another large,
    vertical canvas <i>Blue Intrusion<i>, 1958, in the collection of New York
    University and the smaller <i>Red Landscape</i>, 1957 (sold at Swann
    Galleries on Feb. 14, 2013) - both were included with <i>Carnival</i> in his
    1958 solo exhibition at Bertha Schaefer Gallery. Dore Ashton in her <i>New
    York Times<i> review wrote: (Woodruff's) "large abstractions are often based
    on impressions of landscape. They are done with emphatic, broad strokes, and
    colors are bright and cleanly handled. The free swinging brush movoements
    have enabled Woodruff to clarify his ideas of the implied movements of
    nature - hills, trees, sky." Additionally, <i>Arts</i> magazine review of
    his exhibition mentioned <i>Carnival</i> as one of his large paintings which
    engage on the level of its title "with an excitement, rhythm, progression of
    swift angular, broken shapes and beautiful color". Woodruff continued to use
    landscape as the structure of his abstract painting through the late 1960s -
    see in such later works as <i>Primordial Landscape</i>, 1967, (sold at Swann
    Galleries on April 22, 2021) with similar jewel-like colors.

    Thompson in 1960. Thompson created compositions set in a mythological
    paradise or Garden of Eden, including his dark hatted figures, classical
    nudes and over-sized demigods. His monumental <i>Garden of Muse</i>, 1960, 
    in the collection of the Wadsworth Atheneum is the best known example of
    these scenes.<br><br>This early painting dates from the artist's second year
    in New York after leaving Provincetown. Thompson moved to Greenwich Village,
    finding a studio on Clinton Street in 1959, and soon became part of the
    downtown art scene. There he reconnected with his close knit group of
    Provincetown artist friends. In 1960, he had his first solo exhibition in
    New York at the Delancey Street Museum, founded by Red Grooms, and a
    two-person exhibition with Jay Milder at the Zabriskie Gallery. In December,
    he married Carol Plenda whom he had also met in Provincetown.

    Motherfuckers</i> theme was too controversial for some members of the
    collective. Jones-Hogu produced two related prints, and co-founder Wadsworth
    Jarrell produced a painting using this title. Another impression of this
    work is in the collection of the Studio Museum in Harlem. The other, very
    different, screenprint that Jones-Hogu made using this title is in the
    collection of the Brooklyn Museum. Both prints use the image of an African
    American woman on a beach with white sunbathers.

    with drypoint, lower left.<br><br>Provenance: collection of the artist; Lee

    (2001).<br><br>Exhibited: <i>19Sixties: A Cultural Awakening Re-Evaluated
    1965-1975</i>, Californian Afro-American Museum, Los Angeles, 1989, with the
    museum label on the verso. This significant exhibiton was organized by
    curators Lizzetta LeFalle-Collins and Cecil Ferguson.<br><br>This important
    and powerful anti-war artwork by Timothy Washington is one of the first and
    the largest of his ground breaking early works on aluminum. At the age of
    twenty, Timothy Washington pioneered his innovative technique in the later
    part of 1967. Washington describes the special circumstances of this
    important creative moment in the catalogue essay by Joseph Young of <i>Three
    Graphic Artists</i>: <br><br>"I was in class, and our problem was to do
    something that we would consider very personal. And I think it was the very
    same day that I went home and found that I was reclassified for the draft as
    1-A. So, I knew that I was going to make something relating to the army or
    war. l wanted to work on a substance that was cold and hard, and I thought
    of aluminum as a material that I would like to work on. The first piece that
    I did on aluminum was a triptych which was a social commentary against
    wars."<br><br>The artist spray painted the aluminum plates with black enamel
    paint, and then incised the imagery with an engraving tool - similar to a
    mezzotint or a scratchboard. The Los Angeles native had not yet graduated
    from the Chouinard Art Insitute - he received his BFA in 1969. Eleven of
    these works were included in the 1971 ground-breaking LACMA exhibition
    <i>Three Graphic Artists</i> when the young artists Washington and David
    Hammons exhibited alongside Charles White. Washington continued to exhibit
    his assemblage work, drawings and sculpture at the Brockman Gallery, Gallery
    32 and Wylan Gallery in Los Angeles through the 1970s.<br><br>Today the
    significance of this body of work is widely recognized. Washington's work
    was included in the influential 2011 Tilton Gallery exhibiton <i>L. A.
    Object & David Hammons Body Prints<D> and the 2012 traveling museum
    exhibition <i>Now Dig This! Art & Black Los Angeles 1960-1980<D>. The Los
    Angeles artist had his first solo museum exhibition <i>Love Thy
    Neighbor</i>at the California Craft & Folk Art Museum in 2014. More
    recently, Washington's artwork was featured in the 2017-2020 important
    traveling museum exhibtion <i>Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black
    Power</i> organized by the Tate Modern.

    Bearden</i>.<br><br>However, it is not known, and very unlikely, that
    Bearden completed the intended edition of 75--it was an overwhelming project
    to match and collage the prints. Mary Lee Corlett in <i>From Process to
    Print Graphic Works by Romare Bearden</i> describes the overly ambitious
    production commissioned by Sam Shore, owner of Shorewood Atelier, New York.
    Shore was a major Bearden collector and donated <i>The Block</i> to the
    Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1978. Bearden and his publisher had originally
    selected 18 collages, and planned three different sets of six for the
    project. But the artist only made multiples from the first six collages.
    Swann Galleries sold the only other known complete set at auction on
    February 27, 2011. Corlett p. 13.

    collection, Philadelphia.<br.<br.>This monumental landscape is a mid-career
    painting by Louis B. Sloan, the influential Philadelphia artist and
    educator. Sloan is best known for his plein air landscape painting with
    similar dramatic depictions of natural phenomena, including his well known
    <i>Gathering Storm Over Philadelphia<D>, circa 1961, collection of the
    Pennyslvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadlephia. Here Sloan uses the
    swirling stormy clouds to incorporate a dramatic range of painting handling
    and colors; using a variety of of brushwork, drips and splatter in a
    plethora of greys, purples and blues. This is the largest and most
    significant painting by the artist to come to auction since artist's
    <i>Self-Portrait<D>, 1956, sold at Swann Galleries on October 8, 2009, now

    Oil on linen canvas, circa 1975. 813x660 mm; 32x26 inches. Signed in oil,
    lower right.<br><br>Provenance: private collection, Florida.<br><br>This
    untitled urban landscape is a very fine example of Hughie Lee-Smith's
    painting, a transitional work between his "metaphysical phase" of the 1960s
    and his late period body of work of the 80s and 90s. Despite the painting's
    intense, bright light, the subject of a dilapidated Victorian building
    recalls Lee-Smith's earlier and darker 1950s paintings. The only sign of a
    recent human presence is a single blue balloon, also abandoned and left on
    the street.<br><br>Detroit photographer J. Edward Bailey III's (1923-1982),
    <i>Portrait of Hughie Lee-Smith</i>, 1975, in the collection of Wayne State
    University, captures Lee-Smith painting a scene in front of a similar
    landscape of abandoned houses. Lee-Smith continued to paint urban scenes
    that harken back not just to Detroit, but his life in Cleveland during the
    Depression. Here Lee-Smith shows a singular economy and clarity in his
    vision. With little drama, he evokes the existentialism of the 1970s --the
    deterioration of America's historic urban areas and communities during
    periods of great growth and prosperity in the country at large.

    Modelling wax, circa 1976. Approximately 229x229x178 mm; 9x9x7
    inches.<br><br>Provenance: estate of the artist; private collection, New
    York.<br><br>This expressive bust appears to be a preliminary work by Inge
    Hardison for her 1976 <i>Sojourner Truth</i>, and is, with lot 103 in this
    auction, the first unique work of artist Inge Hardison to come to auction.
    Despite a lengthy career as a sculptor and living to the age of 102, Inge
    Hardison's work is not widely known today beyond her popular series of small
    cast busts of historical figures <i>Negro Giants in History</i> in 1963 and
    <i>Ingenious Americans</i> in the late 1960s.<br><br>Born in Portsmouth, VA,
    Hardison's family moved to Brooklyn in the 1930s where she pursued many
    creative interests including acting and dance. Alice Bernstein in her
    article "Inge Hardison at 100" in the <i>International Review of African
    American Art</i> wrote how after graduating from high school Hardison landed
    a role in the 1936 Broadway production of <i>Sweet River</i>, George
    Abbott’s adaptation of Uncle Tom’s Cabin which won her rave reviews, and
    also appeared in <i>The Country Wife</i> with Ruth Gordon, and in the 1946
    production of <i>Anna Lucasta,</i> co-starring with Ossie Davis and Ruby
    Dee. She later attended Vassar College, majoring in music and creative
    writing, and later took art classes at the Arts Students League in New York.
    She also taught with Victor Lowenfeld at Hampton University from
    1955-46.<br><br>Hardison also made a wide range of figurative sculpture
    including several large public works, including the life-size 1957 bronze
    <i>Mother and Child</i> at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and the 7-foot
    abstract figure <i>Jubilee</i> at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn. Hardison
    was only woman founding member of the Black Academy of Arts and Letters
    (BAAL), an African-American cultural organization created in 1969 for the
    preservation and promotion of black culture. Hardison's standing wood figure
    <i>Sojourner Truth</i> was presented to Nelson Mandela by New York Governor
    Mario Cuomo in 1990. Her artwork is found today in the collections of the
    Princeton University Art Museum, the Detroit Historical Museum, the National
    Woman's Party, Washington, DC, the New York State Harlem Art Collection, New
    York, and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York.

    Keene's <i>Jazz Icon Series.</i> A master of the manipulation of scale,
    color, light, and a lifelong jazz music enthusiast brings Keene's anonymous
    portraits of jazz musicians to life. His use of a vibrant color palette to
    express his passion for jazz, characterized by improvisation and an
    energetic rhythm, reflects his passion for the medium. Music was a large
    part of Paul Keene’s life, and his strong interest in blues and jazz began
    as a young boy. As a child, he was inspired by gospel music. As a teenager,
    he waited with his friends to see jazz musicians playing in the clubs in
    Philadelphia. Keene felt jazz was a rhythmic and unique language. He
    believed that to succeed as a fine artist, “…the work must sing out, and the
    viewer must hear it.” He admired the musician Miles Davis and said he could
    "create a picture in your mind with his music.” Biography courtesy of the
    Michener Art Museum.

    Collograph on cream wove paper, 1997. 723 mm; 28½ inches diameter (tondo),

    margin. Printed by the artist at the Brandywine Workshop,
    Philadelphia.<br><br>Provenance: collection of Anne & Allan
    Edmunds.<br><br>Belkis Ayón (1967-1999) was an Afro-Latina printmaker and
    professor born in Havana, Cuba. Ayón is best known for her innovations in
    collagraphy. Ayón studied engraving at the prestigious Instituto Superior de
    Arte in Havana (ISA) and joined its faculty after graduation. Much of what
    is being discovered and uncovered of her works are credited to her first US
    retrospective <i>Nkame: A Retrospective of Cuban Printmaker Belkis Ayón.</i>
    The exhibition not only revealed the mystical workings of a African
    religious society but also the gamut of Ayón’s artistry and investigative
    skills.<br><br>Ayón's formative years as an artist were plagued by the
    <i>periodo especial</i> in Cuba which began with the collapse of the Soviet
    Union. This most difficult era in Cuba was a time when vital resources, let
    alone art supplies, were not readily accessible. However, this is also the
    time in which Ayón rose to prominence in the contemporary art world: Ayón’s
    work was exhibited at the 16th Venice Biennale, the Havana Biennial and the
    Bharat Bhavan International Biennial of Prints in India. In 1999 she was
    awarded four residencies including with the Brandywine Workshop, the Tyler
    School of Art at Temple University, the Bronski Center at the Philadelphia
    College of Art, and the Bensen Hall Gallery, Rhode Island School of Design.
    1999 was also the year Ayón committed suicide, and left behind a body of
    work that has broken barriers between US-Cuban relations and has pioneered
    discourses regarding African iconography and influence on Cuban culture and
    society. Her sister Katia Ayón Manso is the representative of the Estate de
    Belkis Ayón, located at the Ayón family home in Central Havana where Ayón
    grew up.<br><br>After her untimely death at the age of 32, Belkis Ayón left
    behind an oeuvre that is important to the history of printmaking, traversing
    Cuban, contemporary art, and gender boundaries. Her unsettling subjects are
    typically depicted against stark black patterned backgrounds, as oblong
    almost shapeless silhouettes with hollow, almond-shaped eyes. Her body of
    work functions as a reflection on the mysticism and traditions of the secret
    religious Afro-Cuban brotherhood, Abakuá Secret Society. Described in the
    United States as "an Afro-Cuban version of Freemasonry," this fraternity was
    fathomed in Nigeria and founded by enslaved Africans in Cuba as a society of
    refuge against the backdrop of the vile institution of slavery. The esoteric
    practice is composed of the usage of a creolized African language, rituals
    and ceremonies, and involves many iconographic figures such as princess
    Sikán whom Ayón used as a vessel to investigate the society. She is quoted
    as saying, “They said [Abakuá] was a secret society, only for men, and that
    aroused [her] interest.” That interest was figuratively personified as
    princess Sikán who is recorded as the only female figure in Abakuá lore.
    Ayón's inclusion of egalitarian iconography with the incorporation of
    princess Sikán not only supplanted the Abakuá Secret Society but refuted
    societal norms. She is known for having been the only and the most prominent
    figure with an extensive body of work that traverses and investigates the
    exclusive Abakuán brotherhood. Belkis Ayón was a master at her craft and a
    pioneer in the world of large-scale print installations and collographs, a
    labor-intensive art practice that cemented her place in today both in art
    history and the art world.

    April 28, 2019.<br><br>Illustrated: <i>Culture Quilt: Large Relief Prints by
    John T. Scott</i>, The Printed Image Gallery, p. 15.<br><br><i>Waiting at
    the Station</i> is a monumental woodcut from John T. Scott's series of
    expressive prints of New Orleans, each carved into a single sheet of plywood
    with a small chainsaw. Scott completed what would be one of his last series
    of works in 2003 just a few years before Hurricane Katrina which changed so
    many peoples' lives in New Orleans. Allan L. Edmunds writes it “evokes
    interpretations of the many voices and ever-changing rhythms of life in the
    city, which Scott knew before Katrina. In some respects, Scott’s
    monochromatic compositions pay respect to less glorified and colorful
    aspects of Orleans’ culture - the ‘Quilt’ that binds people together, by
    preserving strong traditions, embracing the history and learning from the
    struggles of the past to know that a rebirth was inevitable.” Referring to
    the practical production of Scott’s woodcut, Susan Stedman writes that he
    accentuates the grain of the wood by hand-pressing prints with so much
    pressure that the tool marks are distinguishable upon each
    impression:<br><br> “Scott chose to emphasize the impact of his hand, making
    recognizable tool marks and lines on the wood’s surface. He described, in
    comparison, one of his bold experiments carving in wood: ‘I didn’t want my
    ideas to look facile…It dawned on me that the only time you can have control
    over anything is when you realize you don’t have control. So, I chose the
    chain saw. I wanted to give up the facileness that I know I have with tools
    to get at a combination of material and tool that was not that compatible
    and not that easy to control.’ [Stunda, 2004]”<br><br>Educator, sculptor and
    printmaker John T. Scott was born in Gentilly, Louisiana in 1940, and raised
    in New Orlean's Ninth Ward. His father worked as a restaurant cook and
    chauffeur while his mother stayed home. He learned embroidery from her that
    served as his first foray into the visual arts. Having a Catholic New
    Orleans upbringing, Scott attended the Xavier University in New Orleans
    receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree. He received his Master of Fine Arts
    degree from Michigan State University in East Lansing in 1965 where he
    studied under painter Charles Pollock. Afterward, Scott returned to Xavier
    where he taught for 40 years. In 1983, Scott received a grant to study under
    sculptor George Rickey, and in 1992, he was awarded the MacArthur Grant from
    the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Scott received an
    honorary Doctor of Humanities from Michigan State University in 1995 and a
    Doctor of Humanities from Tulane University in New Orleans in 1997. His
    works are in the permanent collections of the Baltimore Museum of Art; the
    Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Amistad Research Center at Tulane
    University, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC. Edmunds p.

    University of Maryland, College Park.<br><br>Master printer, painter,
    educator and administrator Curlee Raven Holton has developed a
    thought-provoking practice that confronts the limitations of the lived
    experience. Holton's extensive career and decades of experience allow him to
    address contemporary issues both within his artistic and scholarly work. His
    prints have been exhibited at Egypt’s 7th International Biennale; Taller de
    Artes Plásticas Rufino Tamayo, Oaxaca, Mexico; the Cleveland Museum of Art.
    Cultural and self-reflective, his works are compelling narratives of the
    past, present, and the overlapping of the two.<br><br>Holton is also known
    for his work with other artists - creating collaborative initiatives to
    spark productions in printmaking. He founded the Experimental Printmaking
    Institute (EPI) which focuses on community outreach and supporting student
    artists in 1996 at Lafayette College, Pennsylvania. The EPI studio allows
    students to shadow practicing artists such as Faith Ringgold in the
    production of her print editions. Currently, Holton is the director of the
    David C. Driskell Center for the Visual Arts and Culture of African
    Americans and the African Diaspora at the University of Maryland. Holton is
    also master printer and director of the fine art press Raven Editions in
    Easton, Pennsylvania.

    collection of the artist.<br><br>Since the beginning of Floyd Newsum's
    career, he has painted on paper. His painterly approach is to create tactile
    surfaces and colors of paint on multiple papers forming one composition.
    Refining several systems of cultural and abstract symbols in his work,
    Newsum reflects on his background and history - his latest works show the
    influence of West African art. Newsum has said "I want to to provoke thought
    or conjecture from the viewer. My paintings are a collection of thoughts in
    a single composition, with the power to present more than one
    interpretation."<br><br>A native of Memphis, Tennessee, Floyd Newsum
    graduated from Memphis College of Art with a BFA in 1973 and from Temple
    University, Philadelphia with an MFA in 1975. A painter and printmaker, he
    has taught art for 38 years at the University of Houston, and has exhibited
    his work in more than 78 solo and group exhibitions in museums and galleries
    across the country. Newsum has also created five public art projects, four
    of which are in Houston and one in Fort Worth. His works are in the
    permanent collections of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American
    History and Culture, Washington, DC, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and
    the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

    Anderson Gallery, Buffalo, NY, with the labels on the frame
    back.<br><br><i>Curtain Call</i> is a wonderful example from the artist's
    late series of paintings depicting musicians or actors in a staged
    environment. The year before, in 1988, Hughie Lee-Smith had his first
    retrospective at the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton. Other Lee-Smith
    paintings from this series include <i>End of Act One</i>, 1984, and
    <i>Temptation</i>, 1991.<br><br>These imagined scenes recall Lee-Smith's
    early experiences of dance and theater while working at the Playhouse
    Settlement (named Karamu House in 1941) during the WPA period in Cleveland. 
    Lee-Smith taught art at Karamu House in the late 1930s in return for the
    full scholarship to the Cleveland School of Art (now the Art Institute of
    Cleveland) that the Gilpin Players awarded him in 1935. Inspired by the
    Gilpin Players, a black acting troupe, Lee-Smith also founded an
    inter-racial modern dance troupe there.

    rear edge.<br><br>Provenance: private collection,
    Georgia.<br><br>Illustrated; (another example) Lucinda H. Gedeon.
    <i>Elizabeth Catlett Sculpture: A Fifty-Year Retrospective</i>, Neuberger
    Museum of Art, p. 98.<br><br>An impressive late-career work in luminous
    black marble, <i>Nude Torso</i> is an iconic work by Elizabeth Catlett - one
    of her most recognizable forms that typifies her representation of women.
    This beautiful and highly polished black marble embodies Catlett's extensive
    mid- to late body of work - her later figures are more simplified and
    abstract, with distinctively strong forms and poses.<br><br>In <i>Nude
    Torso</i>, Catlett transforms the traditional <i>contrapossto</> pose of
    classical nudes to now convey the confidence of a strong, modern woman.
    Catlett creates a perfect balance in describing a curvaceous figure that is
    as powerful as it is sensuous. In Melanie Herzog's <i>Elizabeth Catlett An
    American Artist in Mexico</i>, Catlett describes her work as representations
    of women, black women and herself - "I am a black woman. I use my body in
    working. When I am bathing or dressing, I see and feel how my body looks and
    moves. I never do sculpture from a nude model...Mostly watch
    women."<br><br>The distinctively highly finished sculpture also conveys
    sensuality and natural movement. Catlett makes the most of the natural
    qualities of the black marble by highly polishing the surface; Catlett
    stated "I like to finish sculpture to the maximum beauty attainable from the
    material from which it is created." Elizabeth Catlett made several versions
    of this distinctive figure between 1970 and 1998 in various media, including
    orange onyx, in the collection of the Reginald F. Lewis Museum, orange mable
    and bronze. Herzog p. 154.

    in ink, lower edge verso.<br><br><i>Embrace</i> is a photograph that
    visualizes two black men holding each other tenderly in the nude. The
    lighting, shadow, and composition of the image act in the moment to
    illuminate the affection of these two individuals. Photographer Iké Udé
    wrote in "On Lyle’s Case: Mask and Embrace in the Work of Lyle Ashton
    Harris,"<i>THRESHOLDS: Viewing Culture</i>: "The Embrace, that could be read
    as a steel/feathery caress. This picture is of such improbable compactness,
    superbly cropped, oozing sensuality, robed in warm supple tints of light.
    All the senses are in a revel: there's the convergence of thighs, the
    teasing of the groin, the knees begin to buckle, all sensations seem to melt
    under the feet, unabsorbable, repeating ad infinitum."<br><br>Spanning a 30
    year career, Lyle Ashton Harris's oeuvre bridges multiple media. Trained as
    a photographer while working in collage, installation and performance art,
    he has pushed the boundaries of black male representation. His body of work
    critiques the societal norms of sexuality and race while exploring his
    identity as a queer, black man.<br><br>Harris received a Vanguard Award from
    Visual Aids (2018), a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial
    Foundation (2016) and the David C. Driskell Prize from the High Museum of
    Art, Atlanta (2014) among other awards and honors. He is represented in the
    permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York; the
    Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New
    York; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; The Studio Museum in
    Harlem.<br><br>Born in the Bronx, New York, he spent two of his formative
    years living in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Harris obtained a Bachelor of Arts
    degree from Wesleyan University, a Master of Fine Arts degree from the
    California Institute of the Arts, and attended the Whitney Museum of
    American Art Independent Study Program. Harris is currently a Professor of
    Art at New York University and lives in New York.

    permanent collection of the Victoria & Albert Museum,
    London.<br><br><i>Mother Approaching Sixty</i> is Bowling's sole
    photographic and figurative portrait of his career. The neatly drawn
    circular trace overlaid on the portrait appears first in a 1983 painting
    entitled <i>Sand Circle</i> and again in a series begun in 2000, evoking the
    daybreak. In addition, a sharp line crossing the picture plane in Bowling’s
    paintings conjures the horizon and, at once, the liminal zone where figure,
    ground, and viewer converge. Through photographic and printmaking processes,
    this close-up of the artist’s mother, smiling at life’s long sunset, is
    rendered through variation in tones and colors that emphasize her face as
    color, volume, and surface.

    segregation. <i>The Louisiana Project</i> juxtaposes the secrecy that
    surrounds the Rex Ball, an exclusive event attended by members of New
    Orleans’s white upper class, and the not-so-secret sexual liaisons had by
    the male scions of these elite families with African American women from the

    Civil Rights activist Malcolm X by photographer Marion S. Trikosko with the
    1884 painting <i>Madame X</i> by John Singer Sargent. The photograph
    captures Malcolm X in a contemplative moment at a press conference for
    Martin Luther King, Jr. Obscuring the spatial relationship between the two
    figures, Wilson superimposed Sargent’s rendition of Parisian socialite
    Madame Gautreau so that her hand appears draped over Malcolm X’s shoulder.
    The combined image is then inverted in color; both figures are depicted as
    negative images.  Wilson’s work raises the issues of representation in art:
    the idea of a traditionally accepted “canon” of art and how the technical
    processes used to produce works of photography impact representation as well
    as contrasting matters of identity, politics, and power.

    gallery label on the frame back.<br><br>Provenance: D' Amelio Terras
    Gallery, New York; private collection, New York.<br><br>In <i>Riffs on Real
    Time,</i> a series of ten color photographs, Leslie Hewitt sets up a dynamic
    between personal archival images and stock images from newspapers and
    magazines. Influenced by her grandmother's method of arrangement of their
    family photos in albums, Hewitt’s production of the series follows a set
    compositional order. The foreground of the image of a living room, a candid
    shot of a family barbecue in the backyard—suggests a personal iconography.
    The second layer evokes circulated material culture: a snapshot of a 1960s
    civil rights march harkens back to Hewitt’s childhood and her parent's
    involvement in the movement and can be found in either layer. The third
    layer is a background of flooring that reveals various dings, scrapes, or
    gouges resulting from everyday use. Within this third, seemingly
    domesticated layer, Hewitt allows the sense of myriad public and private
    selves to collide and converse.<br><br>Born in 1977 in Saint Albans, New
    York, Leslie Hewitt earned a BFA from the Cooper Union for the Advancement
    of Science and Art, New York, in 2000, and an MFA in sculpture from Yale
    University, New Haven, Connecticut, in 2004. From 2001 to 2003, she was a
    Clark Fellow in Africana studies and cultural studies at New York
    University. Hewitt has had solo exhibitions at The Kitchen, New York (2010),
    Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2011); and Contemporary Art Museum of
    Saint Louis (2012). Her work has been a part of many group exhibitions,
    including the Whitney Biennial, New York (2008), <i>New Photography

    600 studio photographs of anonymous African Americans, most dating from the
    Emancipation Proclamation to the Civil Rights movement. Lovell often

    Bleach on blue paper, 2009. 495x647 mm; 19½x25½ inches. Signed and dated in
    pencil, verso.<br><br>Provenance: collection of the artist; private
    collection, New York; private collection.<br><br>Exhibited: The Project, New
    York, Feburary - March 2009.<br><br>Born in the Bronx in 1970 and raised in
    Cortland, New York, Kori Newkirk fuses art education with childhood
    memories, social and political commentary, and popular culture to create
    multimedia paintings, sculptural installations, and photographs that explore
    the formal properties of materials, the politics of identity, and the
    artist's personal history. He received a BFA from the School of the Art
    Institute of Chicago in 1993, an MFA from the University of California,
    Irvine in 1997, and attended Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in
    1997. Since then, he has lived and worked in Southern California.  From his
    signature lanscape works composed of plastic hair beads to the insertion of
    his body in social spaces and natural environments, his work reminds viewers
    of the isolation experienced by urban youth, the over-consumption of popular
    culture, and the experiences of African-American culture and life.

    Gallery, Atlanta; private collection, New York.<br><br><i>OOT-1528</i> is an
    excellent example of Eric Mack's ongoing body of work utilizing multi-media,
    complex compositions centered around urban design. Using a grid as a
    framework to create his compositons, Mack creates intricate collages from
    graphic images before handcoloring. This early work of Mack shows how he
    investigates multi-media as the springboard for his practice.<br><br>Today
    Eric Mack creates mathematically based renderings with a distinctly
    post-modern approach. His multimedia artworks are informed with superimposed
    grids, patterns, and portals. Layered surfaces are created with paint, found
    objects, natural fibers, and synthetic substrates that explore the systems
    of our visual world. In 1998 Mack received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in
    Illustration from the Atlanta College of Art which was absorbed by Savannah
    College of Art and Design in 2006. His recent exhibitions include

    marriage of complex and improbable forms.<br><br>Adams received his BFA from

    portrays the history of slavery in New York through a series of
    self-portraits taken in the nude at locations that are related to the slave
    trade. Faustine's research for the series led to the rediscovery of the
    history of slavery in the five boroughs of New York, including slave burial
    grounds, slave markets, slave-owning farms, and the landing spots of slave
    ships. The performative aspect of her white shoes references how African
    Americans are forced to deal with white acceptance.<br><br>Born in Brooklyn,
