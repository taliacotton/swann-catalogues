  TYPESET: >-
    Engraving, before 1500.  251x188 mm; 10x7⅜ inches, thread margins.  A very
    good, evenly-printed, well-inked Meder k impression with strong contrasts
    and little to no sign of wear.  Small bunch of grapes with the letters AP
    watermark (Meder 130, which he dates to around 1570).<br><br>Dürer
    (1471-1528) opened his own artistic workshop in the spring of 1495.  In the
    years leading up to this significant development in his career, he had
    trained extensively during his teens with his father, a talented goldsmith,
    as well as with the Nuremberg painter-printmaker, Michael Wolgemut for three
    years (1486-89) and traveled extensively through southern Germany, Austria
    and northern Italy, making a journey to Venice and likely Padua and Mantua
    from the autumn of 1494 to the spring of 1495.  According to Bartrum, "He
    was particularly impressed by the work of artists such as Andrea Mantegna
    (1431-1506), Giovanni Bellini (circa 1430/40-1516) and Antonio del
    Pollaiuolo (circa 1432-1498)," (Bartrum, <i>Albrecht Dürer and his
    Legacy</i>, London, 2002, page 105).<br><br><i>The Sea Monster</i> is, along
    with <i>Hercules, or the Effects of Jealousy</i>, one of Dürer's largest and
    most ambitious engravings of his early career up to around 1500.  They are
    clearly both <i>tour-de-force</i> printmaking efforts by the young
    artist—who was not yet 30 years old--to achieve acclaim and prestige, much
    like his <i>Apocalypse</i> woodcut series from the 1490s.  The engravings,
    however, evince Dürer's profound emulation of Italianate artistic styles of
    the time, notably the work of Mantegna.  In <i>The Sea Monster</i>, Dürer
    combines a Germanic setting (there is a view of Nuremberg castle in the
    background) with a figural group highly influenced by, if not lifted from, a
    Mantegna school composition.  The nymph who is apparently being abducted by
    the sea monster also wears an elaborate hairstyle that was popular with
    upper-class Milanese women at the time.<br><br>Bartrum  notes that Dürer
    sensed early on in his career, during the late 1400s and the opening of his
    workshop, that printmaking would be his path to success and fame, "By
    choosing to make engravings rather than copy them in singular luxury
    objects, Dürer could imprint his art on the products of his father's trade,
    effectively reversing his filial relation through creative priority . . .
    Most importantly, he had a highly developed commercial sense; by 1497 he had
    already hired an agent, Contz Schwytzer, to handle his foreign print sales"
    (Bartrum, pages 21 and 106).  Bartsch 71; Meder 66.

    contrasts and no sign of wear.<br><br>This engraving was made as a
    sympathetic memorial to the peasants of the 1524-25 German Peasants' War, in
    which up to 100,000 of some 300,000 poorly armed peasants and farmers were
    slaughtered by forces of the aristocracy in the German-speaking areas of
    Central Europe during a widespread, months-long revolt.  It was Europe's
    largest popular uprising prior to the French Revolution of 1789.  The
    fighting was at its height in the middle of 1525.  Seeking influence and
    freedom, the peasants were spurred on by radical reformers and Anabaptists
    such as Thomas Müntzer; in contrast, Martin Luther and other Magisterial
    Reformers condemned the uprising and sided with the nobles.  The
    inscriptions on the engraving identify the drummer as a bumbling “Farmer
    Conrad” and the standard bearer as “Klaus Swineherd,” in the same light as
    the figures would have been viewed by the aristocracy and their
    mercenaries.<br><br>Both Hans Sebald Beham (1500-1550) and his brother
    Barthel Beham (1502-1540) were expelled from Nuremberg in 1525, during the
    upheaval of the Peasants' War, for their atheistic and radical views.  This
    engraving may also have served as a testament to the youthful radicalism of
    godless artists represented by the Behams.  Bartsch 199; Pauli 202.

    negotiated a peace treaty with the Carthaginians after the First Punic War
    (256 BC), during which he was captured and held in Tunis.  When he returned
    to Rome on parole with the treaty details, he urged the Roman Senate to
    refuse the proposal.  Over the protests of his own people, to have fulfilled
    the terms of his parole, rather than break his word, he returned to
    Carthage, where, according to Roman tradition and Livy, he was tortured to
    death.  In Tertullian's <i>To the Martyrs</i> and Augustine of Hippo's
    <i>The City of God</i>, it is said the Carthaginians packed him into a tight
    wooden box, spiked with sharp nails on all sides so that he could not lean
    in any direction without being pierced and rolled it down a steep hill.

    of this scarce woodcut.<br><br>This portrait was likely derived from or
    inspired by Giovanni Britto's (1500-1550) woodcut portrait of the Holy Roman
    Emperor Charles V (1500-1558), from circa 1535, that had been based on
    Titian's (1490-1576) now lost oil portrait of the emperor (known from a copy
    by Peter Paul Rubens, 1577-1640, in the Courtauld Gallery, London; see
    Muraro and Rosand, <i>Tiziano e la Silografia Veneziana del Cinquecento</i>,
    Vicenza, 1976, catalogue number 57). Britto's woodcut shows Charles V in
    armor, albeit without the plumed helmet that apparently appeared in Titian's
    oil portrait, as shown in the Ruben's copy. The current woodcut portrait
    depicts Charles V in his full Holy Roman Emperor regalia. He was crowned
    Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Clement VII in Bologna on February 22, 1530, the
    last emperor to receive a papal coronation.

    1559 Anguissola was recruited by the Spanish queen, Elizabeth of Valois, who
    was herself an amateur portraitist, to go to Madrid as her tutor, with the
    rank of lady-in-waiting.  She later became an official court painter to the
    king, Philip II.  After the queen's death, Philip helped arrange an
    aristocratic marriage for Anguissola.  She moved to Sicily, and later Pisa
    and Genoa, where she continued to practice as a leading portrait painter.

    is an illegible date scratched in the plate lower left to the right of the
    artist's signature), though he disputes the dating and explains that all the
    first state impressions he has seen of this plate "were printed on the
    thicker paper that Claude was using in the 1660s and not on the thin paper
    typical of the 30s" (Mannocci, page 126). It therefore appears that the
    correct date for the etching should be closer to 1665.  Mannocci 34.

    in Rembrandt's time as the <i>Eulenspiegel (or Owl-glass)</i>, and Rembrandt
    has conspicuously placed a tame owl on the shepherd's shoulder in this
    etching to further the point.  The <i>Eulenspiegel</i> was known to be a
    wily, shifty character, whom Rembrandt has represented here with a flute

    of this very scarce landscape etching, with burr on the foliage lower center
    and lower right.<br><br>This is among Rembrandt's most inventive landscape
    compositions and shows his mastery of emphasizing depth, by focusing on
    darkly-etched farm buildings and an obelisk in the foreground and receding
    to much more lightly-sketched structures and a solitary figure in a field
    holding a scythe to the far right.  He likely drew this scene from nature;
    the "obelisk" is the boundary post near Halfweg on the Spaarndammerdijk,
    roughly the halfway-point between Amsterdam and Haarlem.  Bartsch 227;

    skull at the far left and on the windowsill, with the landscape through the
    window and all the delicate details distinct and with little to no sign of
    wear.<br><br>Francen (1612-after 1678) was a close friend of Rembrandt and a
    lifelong resident of Amsterdam (though records of the various addresses in
    the city where he lived indicate that he was not a particularly wealthy
    collector).  He was a passionate connoisseur of art, which Rembrandt alludes
    to with the Crucifixion triptych and the landscape painting on the wall of
    Francen's study, as well as the Taoist sculpture on the
    table.<br><br>Francen testified for Rembrandt and helped support him through
    his financial difficulties in the 1650s and 1660s; he also acted as a sort
    of guardian for Rembrandt's children.  Rembrandt likely made this etched
    portrait of Francen out of friendship rather than as a paid commission.

    Bromberg 41).  A brilliant, richly-inked and early impression with vivid
    contrasts and no sign of wear, consistent with the earliest impressions of
    this subject.<br><br>Canaletto (1697-1768), whose work embodies the city of
    Venice perhaps more than any other artist, was a highly fashionable painter
    already known primarily for his topographical views that were popular among
    Europeans (particularly English visitors) on the Grand Tour, when he
    embarked on a series of some 30 Venice-inspired etchings in the early
    1740s.   This project was encouraged and principally financed by  Joseph
    Smith, the British consul to the Venetian Republic, who also acted as
    Canaletto's agent on behalf of foreign collectors.<br><br>Canaletto's
    etchings, most of which are <i>capricci</i>, or imaginary views, blend
    familiar Venetian (and outlying areas such as Padua) vernacular
    architectural elements with classical motifs.  His inspiration to idealize
    these views, many of which partially depict locations found along the Brenta
    Canal, running from the Venetian Bay inland to Padua (known as the "Brenta
    Riviera" and home to many opulent Veneto villas), probably came from his
    father who was a theatrical set designer. DeVesme 11; Bromberg 11.

  TYPESET: >-
    Etching, stipple-work, roulette and engraving, 1797.  343x251 mm; 13½x9¾
    inches, wide margins.  Sixth state (of 6).  Ex-collection Victor Conard
    (Lugt 5549, lower right recto).  A very good impression of this scarce
    print.<br><br>According to Fisher, this is one of only a few prints with
    authorship firmly ascribed to Prud'hon (1758-1823), the bulk of his graphic
    work consisting of designs drawn for other printmakers.  Fisher notes, "This
    print is brilliantly executed entirely with gentle modeling in stipple . . .
    The stipple work is achieved partly with the etching needle and partly with
    a wide, irregular roulette.  [Barthélemy] Roger (who assisted Prud'hon with
    the completion of the plate) and Prud'hon's first engraver, Jacques-Louis
    Copia, were carefully trained by Prud'hon in this stipple technique, which
    was essential to the interpretation of a painting style so indebted to the
    supple brushwork of Correggio (1489-1534).  In this way, Prud'hon's style
    has a much wider impact than his small <i>oeuvre</i> would suggest.  For
    Prud'hon's tonal etching style . . . is almost a protoype for the romantic
    lithography of the early 19th century, especially for the prints of
    Chasseriau and Delacroix (<i>Regency to Empire, French Printmaking
    1715-1814</i>, Minneapolis, 1984, page 312).<br><br>The etching illustrates
    a romantic episode from a poem by Gentil Bernard, in which Phrosine, driven
    by her passion and exhausted after having drifted across the sea to her
    lover Mélidore's island of exile, is awakened by his embrace and kisses.

    impression.<br><br><i>Mer de Glace, Valley of Chamonix, Savoy</i> is part of
    a series of 81 mezzotints created by Turner (1775-1851) and other
    printmakers, after his oils, that have come to be known as the <i>Liber
    Studiorum</i>.  These mezzotints are based on original watercolors by
    Turner, which are turn derived from his paintings, essentially a visual
    catalogue <i>raisonné</i> of all his works.   It's assumed that Turner
    approved of the mezzotint process as it simulated the appearance of
    watercolor on moist paper and, in recognition of their commercial
    viability.  The 1820 introduction of steel mezzotint plates (as opposed to
    copper, which produced very limited quality impressions before the plate
    wore down and required reworking) may have prompted him to issue these
    prints.<br><br>The <i>Liber Studiorum</i> series was produced primarily by
    Charles Turner and other engravers under the direction of J.M.W. Turner,
    with Turner himself working on 11 of the plates (including this one).  
    Turner also produced the 12 additional plates which comprise the <i>Little
    Liber Studiorum</i>, a series of prints that was a sequel to the <i>Liber
    Studiorum</i>.  The <i>Liber Studiorum</i> encompassed the entire
    <i>oeuvre</i> of Turner's work by mixing historical, pastoral, architectural
    and landscape scenes, while the <i>Little Liber Studiorum</i> presents
    ethereal atmospheric landscapes, representative of the iconic paintings for
    which he is now famous.  Finberg 50.

    Etching on cream laid paper, 1859.  83x55 mm; 3¼x2⅛ inches, wide margins. 
    MacDonald's second state (of 2), with the additional vertical shading lines
    in the background.  A superb, richly-inked impression of this very scarce,
    early etching, with all the details distinct and with very strong
    contrasts.<br><br>As Getscher notes in <i>The Stamp of Whistler</i>,
    "Whistler was a very social animal," (Oberlin, 1977, page 13).  His social
    ease was a great aid during his early years in Paris from 1855 to 1859. 
    Through his short training in the studio of Parisian artist Charles Gleyre
    (1806-1874), he met a group of local artists who helped him adapt to life in
    the new city.  His friendship with the artist Henri Fantin-Latour, which
    developed while they were copying paintings by the masters in the Louvre,
    led him into an artistic circle that included luminaries of French painting
    at the time such as Gustave Courbet (1819-1877), Carolus-Duran (1837-1917)
    and Édouard Manet (1832-1883).  Another associate of this group was the
    influential Parisian author and critic Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867), who
    was an early champion of Whistler's work.<br><br>Whistler also visited
    London frequently from 1855 to 1858, mainly to see his half-sister Deborah,
    who had married the artist Francis Seymour Haden (1818-1910), and her
    family.  These visits provided the subjects for more of his etchings from
    this time and prepared the way for his move to London in 1859.<br><br>This
    still-life study, which stands alone in Whistler's etched <i>oeuvre</i>, was
    made shortly after his return to London from Paris upon the completion of
    the "French Set" or <i>Douze eaux-fortes d'après Nature</i>. Whistler and
    his brother-in-law worked closely for several months during this time at the
    latter's house on Sloane Street, London, where Haden had installed his own
    etching press.  Kennedy 27; Glasgow 38.

    Etchings</i>.  A superb, warm impression of this very scarce etching, with
    selective wiping in the water and inky plate edges.<br><br>In July 1879, the
    Fine Art Society of London commissioned Whistler (1834-1903) to visit Venice
    and return by December with a set of 12 etched plates.  Whistler eagerly
    accepted the commission, which  gave him the chance to recoup his losses
    from the Ruskin trial and cover costs on the design of his "White House" in
    Chelsea (the house and contents were auctioned after he declared bankruptcy
    in 1879) and likely  also the means to remove himself from London. One of
    the ironies of the Ruskin libel case is that the Fine Art Society had
    organized a collection to pay for Ruskin's legal costs; they subsequently
    gave Whistler the Venice commission and with it the opportunity to get out
    of the debt incurred by the trial.<br><br>Whistler and his then model and
    mistress Maud Franklin arrived in Venice in September 1879 and remained
    there until November 1880.  During this time, he produced far more than the
    dozen etchings stipulated by the commission; he returned from Venice with
    over 50 etchings, several nocturne paintings and around a hundred
    pastels.<br><br>The Venice etchings are in many ways a continuation of the
    themes he had been exploring in his 1860s/late 1870s etchings and
    lithographs of London and The Thames.  These repeat characteristics include
    a sketch-like, drawn from nature quality, with an indifference to
    topographical accuracy and depth.  Many of the Venice etchings, with watery
    foregrounds and high horizon lines, or directly frontal views of building
    facades, seem very two-dimensional.  A number of the Venice scenes have a
    vignette-like appearance, with central compositions and considerable blank
    space at the edges of the sheet.  Kennedy 203; Glasgow 243.

    Impressionist artists.  Edgar Degas served as her artistic mentor for some
    time and in 1876 invited her to show in the next Impressionist exhibition,
    noting chauvinistically that, "Most women paint like they are trimming hats,
    (but) not you."<br><br>Cassatt and Degas initially had a close friendship
    (though they later had a falling out, not atypical of Degas' relationships)
    and it was under Degas' guidance that Cassatt developed her techniques in
    pastels and printmaking. Cassatt made 220 etchings, drypoints and aquatints
    between the mid-1870s and early 1900s.  Most of her prints were pulled in
    editions of 25 or fewer, rarely was any of her printed <i>oeuvre</i>
    published.<br><br>An early work, created at the height of Impressionism,
    <i>In the Opera Box (No. 3)</i> is among Cassatt's most technically complex
    and celebrated etchings from her first decade as a printmaker and shows a
    clear affinity to Degas' teaching her etching, aquatint and other
    techniques.<br><br>Cassatt also played an important role as an art advisor
    to wealthy American collectors, particularly during the early 1900s, helping
    to promote the reputation of Degas and other fellow Impressionists in the
    United States. In 1901, she accompanied Mr. and Mrs. H.O. Havemeyer on a
    collecting trip in Italy and Spain (she had known Mrs. Havemeyer before her
    marriage). Cassatt was instrumental in shaping the Havemeyer Collection,
    with its strength in French Impressionist works, most of which is now in the
    collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.  Breeskin 22.

    was among the foremost printmakers of the early 20th century, translating
    his heavily-contoured, colorful paintings into richly-inked, painterly
    aquatints with the help of the Parisian master-printer, Roger Lacourière. In
    the late 1880s, Rouault had trained as an apprentice with a glass painter
    and restorer and, in the early 1890s, studied at the <i>École des
    Beaux-Arts</i>, Paris, under the symbolist master, Gustave Moreau
    (1826-1898). Both these experiences certainly influenced his style, as did
    his friendships at the turn-of-the-century with some of the leading Fauves,
    including Henri Matisse, Albert Marquet and Henri
    Manguin.<br><br><i>Automne</i> is Rouault's<i> tour-de-force</i> and a
    secular stand-out in a printmaking oeuvre with a concentration on religious,
    spiritual and Biblical themes. It is among his most colorful, technically
    complex and largest prints, as well as a precursor to the large aquatints
    favored by Picasso and Matisse from the 1950s and 1960s. Chapon/Rouault 288;

    paper, 1923.  Each 239x180 mm; 9⅜x7 inches, full margins.  Edition of 220. 
    Each initialed in pencil, lower right.  Printed by Fritz Voigt, Berlin. 
    Published by Fritz Gurlitt, Berlin.  Superb, dark and richly-inked,
    proof-like impressions.  <br><br>According to Heather Hess, the Museum of
    Modern Art, New York, German Expressionist Digital Archive Project, <i>Yali
    und sein Weisses Weib</i> (Yali and his White Wife) is a fictional story of
    an innocent European woman in a fantastical exotic land.  She is a survivor
    of a shipwreck, and is then subsequently spared from massacre by the Ona
    tribe, who kill the rest of the survivors. The Ona tribe raises her as one
    of their own.  She flees when Yali, a warrior in the tribe, attempts to
    abduct her, living happily alone in nature until she is recaptured and
    forced to marry Yali.  Though the story is set in South America, Pechstein's
    drawings are based on his experience in the South Pacific.  Both the text
    and the illustrations emphasize the woman's snow-white purity and depict the
    tribespeople as animalistic, hypersexual and uncivilized, typical of the
    European view of foreign lands in the 1920s.  Krüger 136-144.

    of only several known artist's proofs, aside from the edition of 100. Signed
    and inscribed "2 essai" in pencil, lower margin. A superb
    impression.<br><br>Chagall (1887-1985) was born in present-day Belarus, then
    part of the Russian Empire, to a devoutly Jewish family. He learned to draw
    in primary school and from a local artist before continuing his studies in
    St. Petersburg. In 1910, having found a patron to support him, Chagall moved
    to Paris and settled within the bohemian <i>avant-garde</i> community of
    painters and poets in Montparnasse. Under the influence of the Expressionist
    and Cubist artists, in addition to the Fauves and Impressionists he viewed
    in the museums, in Paris Chagall was encouraged to explore his
    nontraditional style. <br><br>During the 1910s, Chagall's palette grew more
    colorful and saturated and he became known for his figurative elements in
    arbitrary, dreamlike compositions inspired by Russian or Yiddish folklore
    and culture. Chagall held his first solo exhibition in Berlin in 1914 and
    continued to paint through World War I. After migrating between Russia and
    Berlin, Chagall and his family again settled in Paris, where he learned
    engraving. Ambroise Vollard commissioned him to create a series of etchings
    in 1923 and after the initial project, Chagall returned to printmaking
    throughout his long and prolific career. Kornfeld 42.

    Third state (of 3).  Signed and numbered 63/100 in pencil, lower margin. 
    Printed by Louis Fort, Paris.  A superb, richly-inked impression of this
    extremely scarce, early etching.<br><br>Like many of Chagall's (1887-1985)
    prints from the outset of his career, <i>L'Apparition, I</i> (or <i>The
    Vision</i>) is based on an earlier oil on canvas which dates from 1917.  
    After Chagall moved to Paris in 1923, he created new versions of many of the
    works he had made in Russia.  <i>L'Apparition, I</i> depicts the young
    painter at his easel being visited by an angel.  Chagall's paintings were
    often inspired by his dreams, and the winged angel is only one of many
    fabulous beings replete in his compositions.   Chagall recognized that
    through his art he could escape into his imagination.  He later said that
    painting, "Appeared to me like a window through which I could fly away
    toward another world."  Kornfeld 44.
