    the French 19th century collection at the Louvre, Paris, Ingres' (1780-1867)
    <I>Odalisque</i> (or <I>La Grande Odalisque</i>) created a scandal when the
    painting was first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1819.  Critics lambasted
    Ingres for his rebellious lack of realism and the elongated proportions of
    the figure.  While likely deliberate distortions on the part of Ingres, the
    figure was shown to have several too many vertebrae and was drawn with a
    curvature of the spine and rotation of the pelvis impossible to replicate in
    life.<br><br>The painting was commissioned from Ingres by Napoleon's sister,
    Queen Caroline Murat of Naples, and completed in 1814.  This lithograph, one
    of fewer than ten different lithographs created by Ingres, was published
    shortly after the painting had been widely exhibited in order to further
    capitalize on its fame and notoriety at the time.  Delteil 9.

Original printed paper wrappers.<br><br>Includes etchings by DORÉ, GÉROME, HADEN, COROT, JONGKIND, MILLET, MANET and others.<br><br>In the 1860s in France, a movement grew to embrace etching, which had fallen out of popularity as lithography, photography and reproductive printmaking had taken precedence.  Lithographs, however, were seen as a mass-produced object, and artists were drawn to etching for its expressive and artistic qualities, which mirrored the drawing process.  Artists such as Édouard Manet (1832-1883, see <a href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/Lots/auction-lot/-DOUARD-MANET-Le-Guitarrero--ou-Le-Chanteur-Espagnol-?saleno=2560&lotNo=34&refNo=777235>lots 34</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t and <a href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/Lots/auction-lot/%C3%89DOUARD-MANET-Chapeau-et-Guitare-Frontispiece?saleno=2560&lotNo=35&refNo=774926>35</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t), Charles Meryon (1821-1868, see <a href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/Lots/auction-lot/CHARLES-MERYON-LArche-du-Pont-Notre-Dame?saleno=2560&lotNo=21&refNo=777352>lot 21</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t) and Félix Bracquemond (1833-1914) created highly detailed compositions, focusing on qualities unique to etching (like the use of burr and selective wiping of the plate) and selecting papers and inks as they saw fit.  In 1862, the Société de Aquafortistes was established, founded by publisher Alfred Cadart (1828-1875) and Auguste Delâtre (1822-1907), which promoted etching to artists and the general public.  Part of that promotion included the publication of deluxe, limited edition portfolios, such as the current work, that highlighted artists working in the medium, in many instances the contributing printmakers were already highly-esteemed painters of the day (such as Millet, Corot and Manet in the current work), which became very popular throughout the decade.  This ushered in what is known as the Etching Revival that lasted well into the early 20th century."

    inscribed "imp" in pencil, lower left.  From <I>Twelve Etchings.</i>  A
    brilliant, early and richly-inked impression with warm plate tone and
    selective wiping.<br><br>In July 1879, the Fine Art Society of London
    commissioned Whistler to go to Venice and return by December with a set of
    12 etched plates. Whistler eagerly accepted the commission, which gave him
    the chance to recoup his losses from the Ruskin trial and cover costs on the
    design of his "White House" in Chelsea (the house and contents had to be
    auctioned after he declared bankruptcy in 1879) and possibly also the means
    to get away from London.<br><br>Whistler and his then model and mistress
    Maud Franklin arrived in Venice in September 1879 and remained there until
    November 1880.  During this time, he produced far more than the dozen
    etchings stipulated by the commission; he returned from Venice with over 50
    etchings, several nocturne paintings and around a hundred
    pastels.<br><br>The Venice etchings are in many ways a continuation of the
    themes he had been exploring in his 1860s/late 1870s etchings and
    lithographs of London and The Thames.  These repeat characteristics include
    a sketch-like, drawn from nature quality, with an indifference to
    topographical accuracy and depth. Many of the Venice etchings, with watery
    foregrounds and high horizon lines, or directly frontal views of building
    facades, seem very two-dimensional.  Several of the Venice scenes have a
    vignette-like appearance, with central compositions and considerable blank
    space at the edges of the sheet.  Kennedy 186; Glasgow 216.

    found another impression at auction in the past 30 years.  MacDonald records
    18 known impressions in all eleven states combined and cites this impression
    as the only known impression in the second state ("Whereabouts unknown.

    location, according to MacDonald, is, "The <I>Calle de le Acque</i> as seen
    from the <I>Rio dei Baretèri</i>, San Marco, south of the Palazzo Gussoni
    (where Whistler etched <I>The Doorway, Venice</i>.  The bridge on the right
    is the <I>Ponte de le Acque</i>.  Whistler may have been working from a boat
    or from a doorway above the <I>rio</i> at Number 4934 San Marco, and looked
    west across the <I>rio</i> in the direction of the Rialto.  This view, drawn
    accurately on the copper plate, is reversed, as usual, in the
    print."<br><br>This subject is particularly scarce, as it was one of the
    Venice etchings not selected by Whistler for publication in either series
    <I>Twelve Etchings</i> or <I>Twenty-Six Etchings</i>, and was instead
    printed and sold by the artist himself, independently of any publisher.

    Bacher and other "Duveneck Boys" during the summer of 1880 and proofed his
    plates on a press that Bacher had brought with him to Venice.

    of the base.Based on the wax model Degas (1834-1917) executed circa 1885 and
    the subsequent bronzes cast in posthumous editions by the foundry Hébrard,
    Paris. Illustrated Rewald, Degas: Works in Sculpture, A Complete Catalogue,
    New York, 1944, pages 25 and 104-105, number XLVII (plaster cast and another
    bronze version illustrated).Dancers account for forty of the seventy-four
    sculptures that Degas modeled in wax and are known today (it is believed
    that the artist never intended these wax sculptures to be produced in
    bronze, and the casts were all undertaken only posthumously by the artist's
    estate as well as various other foundries). Many of these relate to the
    technique of classical ballet as practiced in the French dance academies of
    the late 19th century. An exception, however, is La Danse Espagnole, which
    stands out among the rest for its spontaneous sense of abandon and
    sensuality, characteristics that clearly relate to its Spanish theme. Degas,
    like other 19th century French artists who preceded him, notably Manet
    (1832-1883, see lots 34         
     and 35         
    ) was considerably interested in and adopted themes from Spanish art.

    lithographies d'apres les tableaux de Claude Monet. A superb, richly-inked
    impression of this extremely scarce lithograph, with strong contrasts.At the
    end of the 19th century, Monet (1840-1926, see lots 47-51

    ), Edgar Degas (1834-1917, see lots 36-39

    ) and Camille Pissarro (1830-1903, see lots 53-63

    ) rediscovered lithography as a medium both to recreate their artistic
    conceptions on paper and simultaneously achieve widespread distribution of
    and acclamation for their work. These artists, who had invented new ways of
    transmitting impressions of light and color, changing the course of art,
    engaged George William Thornley (1857-1935), an accomplished English
    lithographer and admirer of the Impressionists, to translate their designs
    into lithographs. The prints that emerged from these collaborative efforts
    are the only lithographs in color, save one by Pissarro, by these great
    Impressionist artists. Until he met Thornley, Monet had evidenced no
    interest in making prints. Unlike Degas and Pissarro, who etched on copper
    and drew on stone or transfer paper, or Cézanne (1839-1906, see lots 64-66

    ), Sisley (1839-1899, see lot 71

    ) and Renoir (1841-1919, see lots 43-46

    ), who collaborated with Auguste Clot, the talented Parisian master printer,
    to create color lithographs, Monet either found printmaking too daunting or
    did not seek the public acclaim for his work that printmaking could provide.
    However, he was able to find a hospitable partner in Thornley. The resulting
    collaborative lithographs of landscapes and seascapes, signed by Monet in
    pencil, are informed with the elusive and shimmering light of his iconic
    Impressionist oil paintings.Blanche Hoschedé Monet (1865-1947) was a French
    artist who was both the stepdaughter and the daughter-in-law of Claude
    Monet. She married Claude Monet’s eldest son, Jean Monet, in 1897. The
    couple lived in Rouen, where Jean worked as a chemist for his uncle Léon
    Monet. Blanche worked frequently at Giverny during the 1880s and 1890s,
    adopting a style of pure Impressionism similar to Monet's (scholars believe
    she may assisted Monet on some of his later oil paintings). She certainly
    supported Monet as he grew older and suffered from a loss of eyesight,

    older artist in all aspects of his life and work. The politician Georges
    Clemenceau, their common friend, referred to Blanche as Monet's "Blue
    Angel." After Monet's death in 1926, and for twenty years until her own in
    1947, she took on the responsibility of the house and gardens at Giverny.

    Etching on cream laid paper, 1894.  267x420 mm; 10½x16½ inches, full

    impression.<br><br>According to Boyle-Turner, "This controversial print has
    been assigned to Seguin, to Gauguin, and even to a collaboration of both
    artists."  The artist Armand Seguin (1869-1903) was a close friend of
    Gauguin (1848-1903, see <a
    href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/auction-catalogs/19TH--20TH-CENTURY-ART?saleno=2560&view=&viewby=Lot_asc&filter_value=Gauguin>lots
    79-83</a>) during the late 1880s and early 1890s.  Based on the etched
    inscription upper left, "Chez Seguin à St. Julien," the scene takes place at
    Seguin's Breton home in Pouldu.  Current scholarship regarding authorship
    for the print leans toward Gauguin, in its similarities to other of his
    Breton female portrait compositions.  Kornfeld 25.

    study in Italy at the Medici Villa in Rome from January 1885 to December
    1888.  Sulpis' works, primarily in printmaking, were recognized with several
    honors and awards during his career as an artist; he was made a knight of
    the French Légion d'honneur in 1900 and was elected to the Académie des
    Beaux-Arts in 1911.  Though Sulpis' earlier works are academic in style, his
    validation as an artist by 1900 allowed him to experiment in his
    compositions and imaginative use of colored inks.

    pug named Gypsy the spring of 1885.  Described by Ensor in a letter to his
    close friend Mariette Rousseau, Gypsy was a “minuscule pug that fills the
    house in the evening with his significant presence." A portrait of a small
    pug-like dog appeared as a patch over the colored pencil drawing <I>The
    Temptation of Saint Anthony</i>, held by the Art Institute of Chicago.  The

    painting as a hobby.  In 1879, he moved to New York where he worked during
    the day and attended evening classes at the National Academy of Design and
    the Art Students League.  As American painting was shifting from the
    realistic precedent set by the Hudson River School, Eaton embraced a looser,
    moodier style that would become Tonalism.  Working mostly in oil and
    watercolor, he established himself as a working artist by the 1880s and was
    a founding member of the American Watercolor Society.  Around 1900, he
    discovered the white pine forests in Connecticut which would become his
    signature subject matter; in many of his works he placed them against
    moonlit skies and sunsets cementing his role as a leading American Tonalist.

    Provincetown, Massachusetts art colony and she embraced the white line
    method of woodcuts.  She printed each of her color woodcuts, like many other
    practitioners of this technique in her day, as unique works of art and not

    impression.<br><br>Rebay (1890-1967) was born into an aristocratic family in
    Strasbourg (at the time a part of Germany) and studied painting in Paris,
    Cologne and Munich.  In 1917, she moved to Berlin and was introduced to the
    <I>avant-garde</i> Galerie der Sturm, which was the center of the modern art
    scene in the city.  While in Berlin, she also met Rudolf Bauer (1889-1953,

    263</a>), with whom she had a lifelong relationship.<br><br>Rebay was
    interested in non-objective art, a form of abstraction that was rooted in
    esoteric religious beliefs and philosophical ideas of intuition.  She
    believed this form of art was a cure for a world ravaged by war and the
    burgeoning technological innovations that fueled materialism.<br><br>In
    1927, she moved to New York and was commissioned to paint Solomon
    Guggenheim's portrait.  She took the opportunity to encourage him to collect
    non-objective art and became instrumental in guiding Guggenheim's
    collection.  When he founded the Museum of Non-Objective Painting (now the
    Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) in New York, she was the first curator and
    director of the museum and chose Frank Lloyd Wright to design the now iconic
    building.

    (1861-1944) massive stone sculpture Monument à Cézanne was installed,
    between the double ramps that lead to the terrace of the Orangerie in the
    Jardins des Tuileries, in October 1929, after more than a decade of
    preparatory work by the artist (it was replaced by a lead version in 1943
    and a bronze version was installed in 1964 near the Carrousel in the Jardins
    des Tuileries; the original stone sculpture is in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris).
    Maillol made several preparatory sculpture studies, in which he tried out
    and rejected different reclining poses, that were cast in bronze and on
    which this current work is based. The project was commissioned in 1912 by
    Frantz Jourdain, the founder of the Salon d'Automne, and friend of Paul
    Cézanne (1839-1906, see lots 64-66

    ), who had died six years earlier.

    220-248</a>) Blue Period (1901-04).  During his Blue Period and into his
    Rose Period, so-called for the principal color palettes that he utilized in
    his paintings at the time, Picasso's art explored the experiences of those
    on the fringes of society and those in the poor, bohemian neighborhoods of
    Spain and Montmartre, Paris, where the artist resided in the early 1900s.  
    After rudimentary instruction in the art of printmaking and having completed
    just one other print in 1899, Picasso executed an ambitious series of 15
    etchings and drypoints, <I>Les Saltimbanques</i>. <br><br>During his Blue
    Period, Picasso utilized Mannerist techniques in his execution of figures;
    the elongated forms and compositional tension of Mannerism highlights the
    isolation and austerity of Picasso's subjects.  The flatness of the scene,
    the stylized figures and the organized composition indicate that this is not
    a scene taken from life, but an allegorical scene constructed from the
    glimpses into the lives of those living in poverty.  This is the impact of
    the Symbolist aesthetic, which encouraged the evocation of emotions over
    realism and elevated quotidien scenes.<br><br>Though this plate was
    completed in 1905 and Picasso made some initial proofs, the artist wasn't in
    a position financially and hadn't yet attained the commercial success to
    entertain an edition.  It wasn't published as an edition until 1913 when
    Picasso's art dealer, Ambroise Vollard, purchased the plate and steel-faced
    it, along with the additional plates for <I>Les Saltimbanques</i> created by
    Picasso between 1904-06.  Bloch 12; Geiser 14.

    at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, which set off several years of
    fervent artistic experimentation between the two artists.  By the winter of
    1909-10, both Braque and Picasso had nearby studios in Paris and saw each
    other on a regular basis.  During this time in Montmartre, the artists
    established the basis for High, or Analytic, Cubism, the most abstract form,

    Ballets Russes. One of Picasso's early artistic muses and the mother of his
    son, Paulo, Khokhlova and Picasso met in 1917 in Paris, where she danced in

    ) at the Théâtre du Châtelet.  Picasso had designed the costumes and set for
    the ballet. The couple married on July 12, 1918, and their son was born in
    1921. Though their relationship deteriorated in the late 1920s, Picasso
    refused to divorce and divide his property, so Olga remained legally married

    stylistic and political movements as an artist and writer.  n 1911, Gleizes
    was part of the small Cubist circle whose works scandalized the <I>Salon des
    Indépendants.</i>  After World War I, Gleizes moved with his wife to New
    York, where he witnessed the irreverent art of the interwar years and
    continued to paint in a nonrepresentational style, though Cubism was
    considered old fashioned.  By further exploring the limits of composition
    and color theory, Gleizes strengthened the public's interest in
    nonrepresentative art.  In 1950, Gleizes illustrated Blaise Pascal's
    <I>Pensees Sur l'Homme et Dieu</i> having renewed interest in spirituality.

    Pevsner (1886-1962) studied art in Kiev and St. Petersburg before traveling
    to Paris where he was introduced to Cubism.  While he was a painter working
    with a Cubist approach during his early career, in 1920 he co-signed the
    <I>Realistic Manifesto</i>, which rejected Cubism and Futurism and argued
    that art should be abstract but embrace the reality of space and time (an
    argument similar to Constructivism).   In 1923 he settled in Paris and
    started to create sculpture in the manner outlined in the manifesto.  He
    developed a technique to solder bronze wire together to form plates in order
    to build rather than cast his sculptures.  The <I>Developable Surface
    Series</i> is his best known work, which examined volume of form and its
    relationship with light, movement and spatial perception.  His work pushed
    sculptors to consider space and form as the material and subject matter of
    sculpture in its own right.

    painting he had made in 1911 for his brother, sculptor Raymond
    Duchamp-Villon (1876-1918).  His brother was married in 1911 and had asked
    his artist friends to make him small paintings with which to decorate their
    newlywed kitchen.<br><br>According to Duchamp's later recollection, "I made
    this old-fashioned coffee mill for him.  It shows the different facets of
    the coffee grinding operation and the handle on top is seen simultaneously
    in several positions as it revolves.  You can see the ground coffee in a
    heap under the cogwheels of the central shaft, which turns in the directions
    of the arrow on top" (d'Harnoncourt/McShine, <I>Marcel Duchamp</i>, 1973,

  TYPESET: >-
    Color lithograph printed in black and red, 1922. 298x298 mm; 11 3/4x11 3/4
    inches (sheet), full margins. Created for the Dada tour of the Netherlands,
    January 10-February 14, 1923. A very good impression of this important
    lithograph with strong colors.In 1923, Schwitters (1887-1948) and van
    Doesburg (1883-1931) embarked on their "Dada Campaign", a tour of Holland in
    order to introduce Dada to fellow artists. This poster promoted their
    evenings of lectures and performances as a "Kleine Dada Soirée," or Small
    Dada Evening. Van Doesburg is known for being a founder of De Stijl, a
    movement that promoted a formal vocabulary defined by straight lines and
    primary colors to seek order. Schwitters, a Dadaist, believed in creating
    confusion and destroying concepts of reality. Despite the divergent beliefs
    (and reactions to Post-World War I Europe), when the artists met in 1921,
    they became close friends and collaborators often working together to merge
    fine art and graphic design by developing new forms of typography.

    a self-taught artist.  Inspired after seeing Van Gogh's work exhibited in
    Paris, he began to use bold colors and brushstrokes in his work . In 1905,
    he exhibited at the <I>Salon d'Automne</i> (alongside Derain and Matisse),
    the exhibition at which the critic Louis Vauxcelles called the artists wild
    beasts or <I>fauves</i>, giving the name to the art movement.  He
    experimented by applying unmixed paint directly from the tube to the canvas
    and deviating from literal represetation to expressive color.  Later in his
    career, he used darked tones and figurative realism often depicitng rural
    landscapes, like the current work.

    alongside Georges Braque (1882-1963, see <a

    215</a>) before turning towards emerging modern styles of the late 19th
    century.  He experimented first with Impressionism and Post Impressionism,
    but then embraced more <I>avant-garde movements</i> such as Fauvism and
    Cubism.  He is known as an artist who was continuously experimenting with
    artistic styles and throughout his dynamic career, he also practiced
    Pointillism, Dadaism and Surrealism.  Some of his best-known Dadaist works
    are the <I>mechanomorphs</i> (created and inspired by his time in New York
    during the late 1910s), which blended machine imagery with human
    characteristics.   During this period circa 1910-20, he also became closely
    acquainted with Man Ray (1890-1976, see <a

    both of whom joined him in New York; drugs and alcohol became a problem at
    this time for Picabia and his health declined.  He parted with Dada in 1921,
    and his style continued to evolve over his career often later denouncing
    styles he had previously espoused.  <br><br>This work is accompanied by a

     and 321
    ) for a stage set design that the Comte Etienne de Beaumont, a leading
    patron of the theater and a director, commissioned from the artist in 1933
    for the ballet Palm Beach. The backdrop of this plein-air ballet is the
    beach at Cannes, seen through an awning and veranda of the casino "Palm
    Beach." The nautical imagery was among Dufy's favored subjects, he often
    featured in his paintings the resort areas and seaside attractions in and
    around his native Le Dufy provided the costumes for the ballet as well,
    creating colorful bathing suits accessorized by flowing scarves, which
    echoed the whorls of the central shell and the motion of the sea. Palm Beach
    premiered at the Théâtre des Champs Elysees, Paris, on June 8, 1934, and two
    years later it was performed at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden,
    London.

    recto.<br><br>Garbell (1903-1970) was born in Riga, Latvia and started
    painting at the age of 13.  He first studied art in Moscow and moved to
    Paris in 1923 where he trained at the Académie Ranson with Roger Bissière. 
    While affiliated with the School of Paris, he developed an individual style,
    which combined both Cubist and representational elements.  At the beginning
    of his career he was drawn toward abstraction, but as his work progressed he
    became more interested in representational scenes, instead depicting the
    cliffs and beach at Mers-les-Bains in the North of France.

    ) same-titled oil painting from 1964 now in a private collection. Le Fils de
    l'Homme (or The Son of Man) was painted by Magritte as a self-portrait.
    Among his most famous paintings, the subject was used in this collaborative
    lithograph between the artist's estate, under the direction of the artist's
    widow Georgette Magritte, and the renowned Parisian lithographer Fernand
    Mourlot.The green apple which alludes to the painting's title, a Biblical
    reference to Adam, and figures so prominently in the image, floating in
    front of the man's face, was a repeated motif in Magritte's work. It was

    354-371</a>) was born in present-day Belarus, then part of the Russian
    Empire, to a devoutly Jewish family.  He learned to draw in primary school
    and from a local artist before continuing his studies in St. Petersburg.  In
    1910, having found a patron to support him, Chagall moved to Paris and
    settled within the bohemian <I>avant-garde</i> community of painters and
    poets in Montparnasse.  Under the influence of the Expressionist and Cubist
    artists, in addition to the Fauves and Impressionists he viewed in the
    museums, in Paris Chagall was encouraged to explore his nontraditional
    style.<br><br>During the 1910s Chagall's palette grew more colorful and
    saturated and he became known for his figurative elements in arbitrary,
    dreamlike compositions inspired by Russian or Yiddish folklore and culture. 
    Chagall held his first solo exhibition in Berlin in 1914 and continued to
    paint through World War I.   After migrating between Russia and Berlin,
    Chagall and his family again settled in Paris, where he learned engraving. 
    Ambroise Vollard commissioned him to create a series of etchings in 1923 and
    after the initial project, Chagall returned to printmaking throughout his
    long and prolific career.  Kornfeld 42.

    vibrant colors. <br><br>In 1910, at the invitation of Filippo Tommaso
    Marinetti and Umberto Boccioni, Severini (1883-1966) signed the <I>Manifesto
    tecnico della pittura futurista</i>, cementing his role in the Italian
    Futurist movement.  Living in Paris, he became an important link between
    France and Italy for the Futurists, and organized the first Futurist
    exhibition outside of Italy at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris in 1912. 
    Aiming to depict the dynamism of modern life, many artists in the movement
    depicted burgeoning technology such as cars or machines.  Severini, on the
    other hand, leaned towards depicting the human figure in movement (often in
    dance).  After World War I, Severini moved on from Futurism, embracing
    Synthetic Cubism, and later, a Neoclassical style.  Meloni 28.

    Gallery, London, with the label; acquired from the above by private
    collection, Philadelphia; thence by descent to the current owner; private
    collection, New York.<br><br>Hepworth (1903-1975) was born in Yorkshire and
    enjoyed an early exposure to construction, often accompanying her father to
    his job as a civil engineer. She studied sculpture at Leeds School of Art
    and the Royal College of Art in London alongside Henry Moore (1898-1986, see
    <a
    href=https://catalogue.swanngalleries.com/auction-catalogs/19TH--20TH-CENTURY-ART?saleno=2560&viewby=Lot_asc&filter_value=Henry%20Moore>lots
    397-403</a>) and after graduating, studied in Rome.  Hepworth showed with
    the Seven and Five Society from 1932 until the group’s dissolution in 1935.
    This London group originally formed with the intention of returning to
    tradition after World War I though Modernists, like Hepworth, Moore and Ben
    Nicholson transformed its mission into promoting abstraction.  Hepworth
    became known for her primitive method of "Direct Carving," resulting in
    harmonious smooth forms that have an unspoken intimacy with each other and
    the environment around them. <br><br>By 1947, Hepworth had already gained
    international recognition as a sculptor when she produced a series of
    hospital vignettes while her daughter was ill.  During this time, the artist
    rendered surgeons in operating theaters based on her observations.  She was
    profoundly impacted by the purposeful choreography of the operating room
    staff, the same characteristics she sought in her own abstract sculptures. 
    She found common ground between artists and doctors, as in her words they
    both have a purpose “to restore and to maintain the beauty and grace of the
    human mind and body.”
