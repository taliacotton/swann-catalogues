  CROSSHEAD: ' A large album with 24 photographs titled "Vues de la légation de France  à Pekin." '

    The title continues "M. Constans Ministre de France arrivé à Pekin avec
    Madame Constans Septembre 1886 repartis en Septembre 1887 pour le Japon et
    le Tonkin [Vietnam]." The album begins with images of the French Legation
    buildings and environs, including the arriving delegation and local
    visitors, the interior, and the surrounding park. Some street scenes follow.
    The final images seem to document the continued travels to Cambodia, Aden
    (Yemen), and Japan. Some photographs may be attributed to Thomas Child
    (1841-1898), who was active in the city at the time. Albumen prints, the
    images measuring 8¼x10½ inches (21x26.7 cm.), and slightly smaller, two the
    reverse, mounted recto only to two-toned mounts with a decorative border and
    captions in ink below each photograph. Thick folio, red leather with raised
    bands and decorative gilt on the backstrip, lightly worn; marbled endpapers.

    The Beijing Legation Quarter held all foreign legations between 1861
    (established by the Convention of Peking after China's defeat in the Second
    Opium War of 1856-60) and 1959. The French legation was established in the
    residence of Prince An, and though the homes used for the legations were
    opulent (as is seen in this album), the area surrounding this section of the
    city (and the legations themselves) was apparently in a state of disrepair
    and poverty. 


    Thomas Child is best known for his work in China, and operated out of
    Beijing in the 1870s and 80s. He arrived in China in 1870, and immediately
    began photographing the architecture of the city, the subjectmatter for
    which he is best known and celebrated today. There was no other commercial
    studio in Beijing at the time, and he began to see a demand for his work
    grow. By the late 1870s, he was published in the periodical  The Far East, 
    and continued to sell his prints from his studio in China. He compiled an
    early record of customs, architecture, and people, creating an important
    archive of imagery, including the only known photographic record of his
    architectural subjects. Thomas Child left Beijing in 1889.

    and individual portraits of unidentified Britons, including a gaggle of
    civil servants and their wives in 18th-century costumes, British women
    dressed as nurses for a station bazaar, Madras troops and officers in
    Secunderabad, the European prison, the race track, and the inevitable icons

    Albert Thomas Watson Penn’s relative obscurity as a photographer compared to
    such Subcontinental contemporaries as Bourne, Shepherd, and Dayal, cannot be
    explained by the quality of his photographs. As his images in this album
    attest, he was every bit their technical and aesthetic equal. More likely it
    is due to the fact that he limited himself primarily to the Madras
    Presidency, especially the environs of his hill station base in Ootacamund,
    high in the Nilgiri Hills. 


    Born in Somerset in 1849, Penn left England at the age of twelve and within
    four years had made his way to the Nilgiri Hills. There he set about
    mastering the still nascent art of photography and learning to contend with
    the peculiar Subcontinental difficulties--extreme temperatures, dust, mold,
    disease, poor roads and the slow and perilous transportation of his
    cumbersome equipment--that defeated many of India’s first photographers. 


    Within a few years he was advertising his own “Ootacamund Photo
    Establishment,” and for nearly half a century came to be regarded as the
    region’s premier portraitist and documentarian. His countrymen on their
    hot-season sojourns and the Indian princes who took up summer residences in
    Ootacamund and nearby Conoor especially prized Penn’s landscapes, which are
    still regarded as some of the finest Indian vistas ever taken. 


    After retiring from the field, Penn returned to England for a few years,
    only to move back to his beloved Nilgiris, where, in October 1924, he died
    of apoplexy mounting the steps of All Souls Church in Conoor, where he was
    buried on Tiger Hill.

  TYPESET: >-
    Silver print, the image measuring 8x9⅞ inches (20.3x25.1 cm.); partially
    mounted to a board with a typed caption label from The Sandler Collection on
    verso. 1896; printed circa 1950 or earlier
  at-a-glance: ''
  footnote_provenance: >-
    In this striking self-portrait Frances Benjamin Johnston's confidence,
    subversion of norms, and energetic presence are keenly demonstrated
    throughout the composition. Her crossed ankle, angled openly towards the
    viewer and revealing bright petticoats and tight-clad leg, beer stein, and
    stylized handling of her cigarette, all show a woman in full control of
    herself and her medium. Above her, portraits of men (some identifiable) she
    photographed decorate the mantle, a collection of objects that declare her
    success and highlight her gender. 


    In 1894, just two years prior to making this image, Johnston was described
    as "the only lady in the business of photography in the city" by the  The
    Washington Times.  And clearly, she was conscious of her role as a pioneer
    for women in photography, telling a reporter in 1893, “It is another pet
    theory with me that there are great possibilities in photography as a
    profitable and pleasant occupation for women, and I feel that my success
    helps to demonstrate this, and it is for this reason that I am glad to have
    other women know of my work.” Johnston was one of the first female press
    photographers in the United States, one of the first women to enjoy a long
    successful career as a photographer, recording and reporting on events,
    making portraits of celebrities, Presidents in the White House, and more.
    She documented architecture, advocating for preservation of historical
    buildings, and and earned widespread recognition and fame for her work. But,
    Johnston was not part of artistic circles, and fell out of memory after her
    death. 


    Years later, Lincoln Kirstein discovered a bound album of Johnston's
    photographs made at the Hampton Institute, a preparatory and trade school
    for African American and Native American students. Kirsten gave the album to
    the Museum of Modern Art, which identified and reproduced the images in a
    1966 book. These images have helped bring her back to the public eye.

    George Krause studied painting, drawing, sculpture, and photography at the
    Philadelphia College of Art. In the 1950s, he turned fully to photography,
    spending his free time (he was serving in the Army) to documenting the
    culture of the black neighborhoods in the racially segregated communities of
    South Carolina. In 1959 he returned to his hometown Phildelphia, continuing
    this social documentary work. In 1960, Edward Steichen acquired a photograph
    for the Museum of Modern Art, and in 1963 Art in America selected Krause as
    the only photographer for its "Young Talen Award USA." John Szarkowski
    included his work in exhibitions, and added more works to MoMA's collection.
    Krause received the first Prix de Rome and the first Fulbright grant ever
    awarded to a photographer, two Guggenheim Fellowships, and three grants from
    the National Endowment for the Arts.

    "China puts the Japanese Army on the Run - A Unified Nation Reverses its War

    Fortunes." The feature article includes Robert Capa's cover, plus
    twenty-three additional images, including "The Coming Generation," pages
    11-17. The actual caption beneath this image was as follows: "Scouts see
    Soldiers to War. Note the

    intense concentration of the faces of these Chinese Boy Scouts. They are
    listening to Tsao Li-Tse, China's Minister of Propaganda. He is telling them
    that upon their and their elder brothers in college, falls the job of
    stiffening China's phlegmatic millions into relentless resistance to Japan.
    The date is late March; the place Hankow; the occasion, a farewell
    demonstration for soldiers wounded at Shanghai, now recovered and returning
    to the front. Before long these boys may be marching to the front
    themselves. Many of China's recruits, like the soldier on the Cover, are
    only 14 to 18 years old (A Defender of China)."
