    The first engraving of a much-beloved 1784 painting, usually known by the
    simpler title "Indian Widow," which is now in the Derby Museum in England.
    It was likely inspired by a passage on Muscogee and Chickasaw funerary rites
    in James Adair's 1775 "History of the American Indians," page 187: "If he
    was a war-leader, she is obliged for the first moon, to sit in the day-time
    under his mourning war-pole, which is decked with all his martial trophies,
    and must be heard to cry with bewailing notes. . . . They are allowed no
    shade, or shelter." A stormy coastline and raging volcano can be seen in the
    background.

    This view had a long history. The proprietor of Pennsylvania, Thomas Penn,
    wanted an engraved view of his bustling young city. Several artists tried
    and failed to capture the scene from across the river before mapmaker George
    Heap completed his 7-foot drawing in 1752. The resulting engraving was
    majestically detailed but too large to be conveniently displayed. A 3-foot
    version was engraved in 1756, followed by this unofficial adaptation of the
    second version which was issued as a plate in the London Magazine in October
    1761. It features insets of the State House and battery. Snyder, City of

    The composition was likely inspired by Benjamin West's much-loved 1770
    painting "The Death of General Wolfe," set at the 1759 Battle of Quebec.
    Wolfe's French counterpart Montcalm also suffered a mortal injury that day.
    While West's painting took a few liberties with the historical facts, this
    one goes a bit farther, as Montcalm had been badly wounded on the retreat
    from the Plains of Abraham, but made it back within the city walls on
    horseback and did not die until the next morning. Palm trees are also
    notably in short supply in Quebec.

    Issued as the abolition movement was reaching its peak, this composition
    places Crispus Attucks front and center in this seminal moment in the
    nation's founding. Armed only with a club, he is about to be run through by
    a British soldier's bayonet. Champney's 1855 drawing, though created more
    than 80 years after the event, was the first image to acknowledge the
    historical fact of Attucks at the massacre. While the background is largely
    faithful to Paul Revere's depiction, here the colonists are engaging
    directly with the British rather than being gunned down at a distance. See

    Bernard Romans (circa 1720-1784) was present at the Battle of Bunker Hill as

    along with a smaller "Correct View" engraved by Aitken for the Pennsylvania
    Magazine. The present edition, a close copy of the Romans original, was

    While a distraught Englishman wrings his hands and a British lion sleeps, a
    cow representing British commerce is being exploited by its enemies. An
    American saws off one of its horns, it is milked by a Dutchman, and a
    Frenchman and a Spaniard stand by with bowls of milk. Philadelphia looms in
    the background. This composition initially appeared in Westminster Magazine
    in February 1778, and was frequently re-engraved in this period. The present
    version was issued without a date or credit line, but has a lengthy caption
    in French beginning "La Vache a Lait, Représente le Commerce de la
    Grande-Bretagne." It can be distinguished by other versions by the tears in
    the Englishman's eyes. Cresswell 781a.

    The first of these paired prints, issued in the same format and on the same
    date, is "The Memorable Engagement of Captn. Pearson of the Serapis, with
    Paul Jones of the Bon Homme Richard & his Squadron, Sep. 23 1779." It is a
    British depiction of one of the Battle of Flamborough Head, one of the great
    American naval victories of the war, spinning the defeated HMS Serapis as
    having "saved the Baltic fleet under his convoy, tho' obliged to submit to a
    much superior force." It was this battle in which John Paul Jones is said to
    have uttered the immortal words "I have not yet begun to fight." This print
    shows the battered Serapis near the end of the fight, with its mast blown
    off and two crew members clinging to it in the water. <br><br>Also included
    is the "The Distressed Situation of the Quebec & the Surveillante, a French
    Ship of War . . . 6th of October 1779.” This lesser-known battle between the
    British ship Quebec and a French naval vessel attempting to break blockade.
    The scene depicted is yet more dramatic than the Flamborough Head view, with
    the ruins of the Quebec in flames as the desperate crew takes to the water.

    One of the first engraved portraits of Washington ever produced, said to be
    after the wholly imaginary artist "Alex'r Campbell of Williamsburgh in
    Virginia," for a European audience eager to see the face of the new
    revolution. It depicts him on horseback with a drawn sword as his troops
    repel a British charge in the background. A copy of this print was sent to
    the Washingtons a few months later. General Washington replied politely,
    describing the subject of this print in the third person: "Mr. Campbell,
    whom I never saw to my knowledge, has made a very formidable figure of the
    Commander-in-Chief, giving him a sufficient portion of terror in his

    A dramatic ¾-length portrait of the general standing confidently as a battle
    rages behind him. Printseller C. Shepherd, responding to a great European
    demand for images of the American Revolution, issued a series of portraits
    during the war's first months, including 3 poses of General Washington.
    However, Washington had never crossed the Atlantic and no other Washington
    images were available on the British market until 1781, so these portraits
    were apparently created from Shepherd's imagination. No other record has
    been found of an actual artist named Alexander Campbell working in Virginia
    during this period. "If the publishers assumed that priority alone would
    make these . . . likenesses popular, they were right . . . Within only a few
    years these fictitious images of Washington had spread through
    Europe"--Wick, Washington pages 18-22. "These Shepherd prints alone
    furnished to Europe a representation of Washington's appearance, and for
    that reason they have considerable importance"--Morgan & Fielding, Life

    The earliest representations of Washington in Europe were the fictional
    Shepard-Campbell portraits of 1775 and their many imitators. In July 1780,
    Washington's former aide-de-camp John Trumbull came to London, hoping to
    launch a career as an artist under the tutelage of Benjamin West. One of his
    first projects was a portrait of Washington done from memory, and influenced
    by a Peale portrait he had copied back in America. He was imprisoned in
    November 1780 in response to the hanging of British officer John André,
    where he remained through July 1781. During his time in prison, the
    prominent mezzotint engraver Valentine Green set the portrait to paper,
    possibly the first print of a Trumbull painting--and the first print of
    Washington in Europe with any claim to accuracy. In the waning years of the
    war, it soon became the definitive European depiction of the American
    commander. Cresswell 215; Hart 84; Morgan & Fielding, pages 172-3.

    A black-bordered issue of a weekly newspaper devoted largely to the memory
    of the recently fallen Father of our Country. The front page features an
    engraved American eagle in the masthead, and the text of his famous farewell
    address of 1796, with the admonition that "every American listen to the
    voice of the departed, as if he spake from the skies, with the
    trumpet-tongue of an Angel." The second page has his 1798 letter on
    accepting command of the army, as well as a report of his Georgetown funeral
    with a diagram of the procession. The third page includes an account of his
    final illness by attending doctors Craik and Dick, the local Portsmouth
    ceremonies, and resolutions issued by the Senate and John Adams. The final
    page (which displays with the first) features hymns sung in Washington's
    honor, as well as an advertisement illustrated with an American flag.

    The first piece is a deathbed scene, with one of the two physicians checking
    Washington's pulse and Martha Washington weeping at the foot of the bed. A
    bottle of medicinal port sits on the bedside table. Below are four lines of
    verse: "Americans behold & shed a grateful Tear / For a man who has gained
    yo'r freedom most dear / And now is departing unto the realms above / Where
    he may ever rest in lasting peace & love." This print was not issued with an
    imprint line, but was issued as a companion piece with "Lived Respected and
    Fear'd." "Its stark and unadorned simplicity . . . is truly a prototype for
    that favorite of lithographic images in the nineteenth century, the deathbed
    scene"--Wick 73. <br><br>The companion print shows Washington's portrait
    atop a funeral urn. Above him flies the angel Fame bearing a scroll titled
    "Tears of America." The mourners are allegorical figures of Columbia
    (bearing an uncanny resemblance to Martha Washington in the earlier print)
    and Justice (holding her scales). This also has four verses below: "Columbia
    lamenting the loss of her Son / Who redeem'd her from Slav'ry & Liberty won
    / While Fame is directed by Justice spread / The sad tidings afar that
    Washington's dead." This is the second of 3 states of this engraving. The
    first, identified by Hart as 644a, had a portrait after Wright. This second
    state replaces the portrait with one after Stuart. The more commonly seen
    third state erases the final words "& Luzarder 1800" from the imprint line.

    painting is described in Morgan & Fielding's "Life Portraits of Washington"
    as #7 by Joseph Wright (page 78 and plate facing page 80), which was
    purchased at auction in Alexandria, VA in 1815 by Thomas Shields. James P.
    McKean (1805-1882), listed here as the owner of the painting, was the
    son-in-law of Shields. The painting was later sold by the McKeans to the

    This literally uplifting image was first published in 1802. Washington is
    raised from his tomb by two figures described in the advertisement as
    "Immortality" and "the spiritual and temporal Genius." The weeping
    allegorical figure of America mourns at his feet, bearing a liberty pole and
    trampling a serpent, with a mourning Indian beside her. The emblems of the
    Society of the Cincinnati and the Freemasons hang on ribbons from the tomb.
    This print was often known as "The Apotheosis of Washington," but never
    actually bore that caption. It went untitled until the present title,
    "Commemoration of Washington," was added circa 1816. The composition was
    repurposed in 1865 with the superimposition of Lincoln's head (see lot 248,
    from a different consignor). <br><br>A long pencil note on verso offers a
    bit of provenance: "This print acquired in Glasgow, Scotland from the estate

    This image by Robert Edge Pine, published by the artist, depicts the
    allegorical figure of America mourning at a monument to four martyred
    American generals, amid the ruins and desolation of war. Other figures bring
    her peace (an olive branch), liberty (represented by a cap on a pole), and
    plenty (a cornucopia). The original painting was done in 1778; the American
    generals named in the monument all died from 1775 to 1777. The message of
    this engraving was perhaps even more timely when this engraving was
    published two weeks before the Battle of Yorktown. Another engraving of this
    painting, done by Amos Doolittle, is thought by Reilly to be a later

    First state. An allegory of ascendant American liberty using Roman
    iconography. The goddess Minerva pays tribute to fallen American war heroes
    amidst monuments, the Constitution, and the Declaration of Independence. A
    bonfire is fueled by crowns and scepters. In the foreground, horrified
    monarchs flee into the woods while a partially dismembered hydra twitches in
    the darkness. Much of this is explained by the accompanying prospectus, as
    well as a lengthy caption which was later added to the 1798 second state.

    French and American revolutionary ideals is stressed by the presence of
    Rousseau's ashes in an urn, and "a little Genius presenting to view the

    This graphic representation of eighteen centuries of Christian history was
    compiled by David Sherman Rowland (1719-1794), a Congregational minister in
    Windsor, CT. It was published by his sons twelve years after his death. The
    renowned Amos Doolittle was brought in to do the engraving and printing. Two
    vignettes depict Adam and Eve, and Solomon's Temple. Some American history
    is presented for context in the 17th and 18th centuries, including the
    founding of the colonies and Yale College, and the key events of the
    American Revolution. Many of the sects which went from Europe to the
    colonies, such as the Moravians, Methodists, and Shakers, are noted, though
    the Society of Friends (Quakers) are notable by their absence. <br><br>"The
    central stream of Christianity becomes murky with 'the dark shades of error'
    during the Middle Ages, with only a thin, clear channel of dissent running
    through. During the Protestant Reformation, several dissenting channels
    separate from and then rejoin the main stream of Christianity"--Rosenberg &

    Catlin originally painted this scene of a Choctaw lacrosse ceremony in 1834
    near Fort Gibson, in what is now eastern Oklahoma, while accompanying
    General Leavenworth's First Dragoon Expedition. In his "Letters and Notes,"
    he recalled “Night came on without the appearance of any players on the
    ground. But soon after dark, a procession of lighted flambeaux was seen
    coming from each encampment, to the ground where the players assembled . . .
    and at the beat of the drums and chaunts of the women, each party of players
    commenced the ‘ball-play dance.’ Each party danced for a quarter of an hour
    . . . rattling their ball-sticks together in the most violent manner, and
    singing as loud as they could raise their voice . . . and all their voices
    joined in chaunts to the Great Spirit; in which they were soliciting his
    favour in deciding the game to their advantage.” It is here set to stone as

    The artist George Catlin is best known for his American Indian portraits.
    Two years before he headed west to begin his life's great work, he painted
    and published these two matching views of West Point: one looking north
    across the parade ground up the Hudson River, and the other looking south.
    In both, the cadets can be seen drilling, with civilian spectators watching
    raptly. The Eleazar D. Wood monument can be seen in the foreground of the
    south view, and in the distant background of the north view; it was often
    used as a navigational landmark for ships coming down the Hudson. The
    southern view is the first state published by Catlin under his 15 May 1828
    copyright; the north view is the second state issued after the plate was
    "transferred to G. & C. & H. Carvill" (they were active circa 1830-31).

    This sweeping Mexican War view is credited to "a sketch taken on the spot by
    Major Eaton, aid de camp to Gen'l Taylor." Among the junior officers who
    distinguished themselves that day were Braxton Bragg, William T. Sherman,
    and Jefferson Davis. The artist, Major Joseph Henry Eaton, was an
    accomplished amateur who left no other known works. Much of the credit for
    the quality of this print is surely due to the lithographer, Frances Flora
    Bond "Fanny" Palmer (1812-1876), who was foremost among the very few women
    in her field during that period. She began her career in England, emigrated
    to New York circa 1843, and did freelance work for a variety of publishers

    whale ships north of the Bering Strait were caught by an unexpectedly early
    freeze in late August. 33 of them were trapped in the pack ice, with some of
    them crushed. In a remarkable show of solidarity, their entire crews were
    transferred by small whaleboats to the 7 ships which remained free of the
    ice. All 1219 men were saved, but the 33 ships were lost--a harsh blow to an

    Captain William Latané was a Virginia cavalryman killed in action under
    Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart in June 1862. His body was taken to a
    nearby plantation for burial. As the plantation's white men were fighting at
    the front, and the local minister was delayed from attendance by Union
    troops, the funeral was handled by the women and enslaved people. The scene
    was described in a poem, and in 1864 was captured on canvas by William R.
    Washington. After the war the painting was reproduced in several popular
    prints, of which this was the first, and became an enduring image of the
    Lost Cause. "A standard decorative item in late-nineteenth-century white

    Washington Ludlam (1854-1935) began this diary in 1884, working on his
    father's farm in Bradfordton, IL just north of the state capitol in
    Springfield. That October he married a widow named Lillian with 3
    children--his proposal letter is included in this lot. A baby girl followed
    in 1889. Tending to 80 acres (corn, oats, other crops, and livestock) was
    difficult work, made more difficult by the region's hot summers and brutal
    winters. His diary entries are thorough and readable (he took college
    classes at Illinois Wesleyan as a young man), and he made time to comment on
    national and local politics. Illinois first permitted women to vote in
    school elections in 1892, and Ludlum recorded the historic moment: "This
    morning Lillian, Josie, Grandma [Lillian's mother], Mrs. Stone, and Mary
    Tabler went up to the school house and were registered to vote at the next
    election for school officers. They are the first ladies that have ever
    registered in this township. We had some trouble to convince the judges that
    they were entitled to register, til Mr. Stone went home for a copy of the
    last law. This I believe to be the beginning of universal suffrage" (1
    November 1892). A week later "all went to the poles, the ladies to cast
    their first balot for school officers, which after the judges had argued and
    talked and opposed (2 of them) for an hour, they were permited to do, and
    came away triumphant." <br><br>The challenges of life on the farm started to
    take a bleaker and stranger turn in the 1890s. The family barn burned down
    on 14 March 1890, with no fire insurance: "It looks like it had been set on
    fire, but I hate to think anyone could be so mean. . . . It is a dead loss."
    On 29 October 1891, they found a colt's throat cut: "How it was done we
    cannot immagine, as there was no barbed wire near it." The family enjoyed a
    visit to Chicago's great Columbian Exposition on 3-7 October 1893, described
    in great detail over 10 pages. However, it was clear that their life in
    Bradfordton was unsustainable. <br><br>Almost 40 years old, Ludlum had never
    been more than ten miles west of his family farm. On 6 February 1894, in the
    midst of the harsh winter, he got on a train west. 4 epic days of entries
    describing the Dakota Badlands, Rocky Mountains, Indians, and saloons,
    before arriving in the new settlement of Sunnyside in central Washington.
    Pleased by the "magnificent orchards" he "concluded that I will invest here
    and try my fortune" (12 February). He returned to Illinois to sell off his
    land and livestock, gathered his family, and brought them west. They brought
    16 rooms worth of furniture and could only find a two-room cabin; they were
    unfamiliar with the land and climate: "Clear but a terrible dust storm all
    day, which is the second day of it. Our garden is about ruined, what is not
    blown out of the ground or killed is covered under a sand bank. I don't
    think I want to live on this sand hill another year" (4 May 1894). More dust
    storms followed; jackrabbits attacked their fruit trees. <br><br>On the 4th
    of July, Ludlum seemed to grasp the absurdity of the young settlement: "This
    is the first celebration of our town, about 300 people present, where last
    4th was nothing but sage brush and jackrabbits." On 13 September, they
    announced their plans to leave Sunnyside for southern California. Several of
    their neighbors said they had the same plan. On 22 October, he arrived in
    Los Angeles to scout land: "I have been in beautiful cities before and seen
    beautiful grounds and residences, but nothing equal to this. Here for the
    first time I saw oranges growing, whole groves of them, and other tropical
    trees & shrubs in profusion." Back in Sunnyside it was harvest time: "We
    finished digging our potatoes . . . but price is so low they are hardly
    worth hauling off. Fine potatoes but not a very large yield. Have covered
    them up in the field. Have not yet sold my corn" (3 November 1893)." The
    Ludlams left on 18 November and arrived in late November in Palmdale, CA,
    just north of Los Angeles, where they bought 20 acres and a small hardware
    store on 13 January 1895. The town's land titles and water rights came into
    question. After a town meeting on 26 July 1895 he wrote "The whole district
    is upset and we don't know where we are, who the water belongs to, who the
    land belongs to, or who we belong to." On 2 August 1896, after a long gap,
    Ludlow summarizes: "Our titles are still uncertain, the tunnel still
    unfinished, the winter rains and snows were short and our water long since
    failed to reach us. The alfalfa is as dry as the road. . . . We are thinking
    of going to Fla if we can raise enough money." <br><br>On 1 November the
    increasingly desperate family arrived in Auburndale in central Florida,
    following yet another scenic cross-country train trip, where they set out to
    raise oranges and tomatoes. Ludlam's final entry in the diary also closed
    out the year: "Settled to try our fortunes at orange and truck raising. . .
    . We hope and believe that the change has been for the better" (31 December
    1896).

    Robert H. Pettigrew (1788-1841) of Savannah discusses the unsettled

    1836: "I am very desirous to visit you . . . but the unsettled state of the
    Indian country rather deters me. . . . I wrote to father & mother some weeks
    since but have received no answer. This renews my apprehension that the
    intercourse is not free or safe. I conversed with some wagoners from the
    Chattahoochee & they said travellers through the Creek country was not
    safe." <br><br>Pettigrew also announces with relief that he has "lost no
    lives among my negroes" during a recent hurricane. He considers selling his
    plantation and moving west: "Your land and Negroes must follow the price of
    cotton, that is very low. The papers give frequently an account of Negroes
    selling for 300 dollars. . . . I could put fifteen or twenty hands in the
    field and a certainty of revenue . . . would make me very comfortable."

    Peter Perkins Pitchlynn (1806-1881) was a Choctaw from Mississippi, the son
    of a Scottish-born father who was raised among the Choctaw himself. He
    graduated from the University of Nashville and became an important educator,
    moving with his people to Oklahoma on the Trail of Tears. When this portrait
    was done he was serving as Choctaw delegate to the United States, and became
    chief of the Choctaws in 1864. <br><br>Shortly after this portrait was done,
    visiting author Charles Dickens had an intense conversation with Pitchlynn
    while on a steamboat on the Ohio River, which he described at length in his
    American Notes: "He was a remarkably handsome man; some years past forty, I
    should judge; with long black hair, an aquiline nose, broad cheek-bones, a
    sunburnt complexion, and a very bright, keen, dark, and piercing eye. There
    were but twenty thousand of the Choctaws left, he said, and their number was
    decreasing every day." Pitchlynn noted "with a good-humoured smile and an
    arch shake of his head, that the English used to be very fond of the Red Men
    when they wanted their help, but had not cared much for them, since."
    Pitchlynn "sent me a lithographed portrait of himself soon afterwards; very
    like, though scarcely handsome enough; which I have carefully preserved in
    memory of our brief acquaintance."

    Sanderson Woodruff Ormsby (1858-1929) was a photographer best known for his

    in northeastern Montana. Included here are 9 original prints by Ormsby,

    album leaf. <br><br>The standard biographical account of this photographer
    reads "Very little is known about S.W. Ormsby." He led an unusually random
    and peripatetic life, with his photographic career as only one short but
    interesting chapter. As nearly as we can piece together, he was born in 1858
    in Santa Rosa, CA. He was apparently named after Judge Silas Woodruff
    Sanderson (1824-1886), who had married into the Ormsby family. His father
    was a physician in a succession of gold-mining towns, and also dabbled in
    minting gold coinage. We don't know much about Ormsby's early adulthood, but
    by 1897 he was working as a Great Northern railway station agent in remote
    Wolf Point, Montana. He was an amateur photographer in his free time, of
    which he had quite a bit. On the morning of 10 August 1897, he got a local
    Assiniboine named Yellow Boy to pose in the traditional gesture of peace,
    standing with his weapons on the ground and one hand lifted to his forehead.
    The shot won first prize in an amateur photography contest held by the
    Minneapolis Tribune, which pronounced that "we do not remember ever having
    seen so good an illustration of the Indian as he appears in poetry and
    romance" (7 November 1897). They later declared it "the finest Indian
    photograph ever made" (4 September 1898). This opportunity thrust Ormsby
    briefly on the path to photographic stardom. Variously titled as "Peace,"
    "Chief Yellow Boy Giving the Peace Sign," or "The Real Indian," his
    masterpiece was published in Cosmopolitan Monthly (January 1898, page 330),
    "Photograms of '98" (page 41), and several newspapers. A life-sized painting
    of the photograph on glass by Marion Graves was displayed across the
    country, including the expositions at Omaha (1898) and Buffalo (1901).
    Ormsby took this opportunity to quit his day job as a station agent and
    pursue photography full-time, but was unable to capitalize on his initial
    success. By 1900, he was working as a cashier in Spokane, WA. The last
    reference we find to his photographic work was in 1901 as an assistant to
    Harrie C. Barley in Skagway, Alaska (Daily Morning Alaskan, 23 May 1901).
    <br><br>The remainder of his life was spent cycling through occupations and
    cities. He married Lucy Maley in 1902 in Des Moines, Iowa; their only son
    Francis Maley Ormsby was born there the following year, and in 1904 he was
    listed a manager of a land and loan company. From 1910 to 1912, he and the
    family were back in Spokane, where he was an advertising writer for the
    Inland Advertising Agency. He was in Portland, Oregon from 1913 to 1917, at
    one point selling real estate. His final stop was Boise, Idaho. He was
    listed as a hotel clerk in 1927, a woolgrower in 1929, and finally on his
    1929 death certificate as simply a "laborer." Shortly after his death, his
    son Francis assumed the name Brother Zara, became a Buddhist monk, and
    removed to Japan. This earned him extensive newspaper coverage. If you have
    any doubts that the many lives led by these S.W. Ormsbys were one and the
    same, a 1943 profile of his son Francis recounted that "his mother, Mrs. Lou
    M. Ormsby, was teaching American Indians on reservations in Iowa, Idaho and
    Minnesota, and his father, the late Sanderson W. Ormsby, was adopted by
    Assiniboin-Yankton Indians in Montana" (Berkeley Daily Gazette Archives, 22
    November 1943).

    This agreement was made among Sons of Liberty leader Isaac Sears and other
    members of New York's mercantile community who resisted British taxation.
    After the Stamp Act was repealed, Parliament passed the Townshend Acts in
    1767, hoping to recoup some of that lost income with a series of other
    taxes. This in turn inspired Non-Importation Associations among merchants in
    most of the major American ports, closely allied with the radical Sons of
    Liberty. Merchants found to be offering newly imported goods were identified
    and shamed, and coaxed into making public apologies. <br><br>This agreement
    recalls that a "certain agreement of non-importation" was unanimously agreed
    upon by the city's merchants in 1768, and lists 25 men by their initials who
    had been appointed in 1768 to enforce the agreement. This committee had
    fallen down on the job, "the majority of whom, by their sordid designs,
    ignorance, inattention & timidity have utterly perverted the laudable
    intention of the afores’d inhabitants, & will, if not timely prevented,
    accomplish a general importation." Thus a new committee was formed
    "frustrate the direful machinations of the enemies of our country & preserve
    its most manifest rights, do hereby solemnly promise & engage mutually to
    assist each other on all necessary & justifiable emergencies." The members
    are sworn to absolute secrecy. <br><br>24 signatories are listed, among them
    the undisputed local leader of the Sons of Liberty, Isaac Sears; and another
    active member, Edward Laight. Other prominent men on the list include Isaac
    Low, who later served in the first Continental Congress and later switched
    sides to the Loyalists; and Peter T. Curtenius, who later became a
    Commissary General for the Continental troops. <br><br>The enforcement of
    the non-importation agreement was a constant struggle in New York during
    this period, discussed in numerous broadsides and newspaper articles in 1769
    and 1770. Offered here is the secret agreement of the men who made it
    happen.

    This letter is the key turning point in an interesting story, though if you
    are squeamish about bad language you might want to skip to the next lot.
    Eleazer Fitch (1726-1796) was a very prominent resident of rural Windham,
    CT: a Yale graduate, sheriff from 1752 to 1776, colonel in the French and
    Indian War, and a huge man for his era at 6'4" and 300 pounds. In the 1770s,
    Windham became one of the more radical towns in eastern Connecticut, but
    Fitch did not join in the sentiment, and became an increasingly outspoken
    Tory. By 1774, the town radicals had arranged a total boycott on Fitch, but
    he remained sheriff. Even after independence was declared, when Tories were
    being rounded up across the new nation, the people of Windham petitioned the
    state government in September 1776 only to remove Fitch as sheriff--either
    out of deference to his high station or naked physical fear. While this
    petition was being considered, the local Committee of Inspection intercepted
    a damning letter from Fitch--the letter offered here: <br><br>"It will be no
    news to tell you the infamous storey of my treatment here as you must have
    heard it before this time. They begin to be very much ashamed of their
    conduct, and I believe wish most heartily they had let me alone. Butt
    whether that be so or not, I despise them all together. That you may rely
    upon is a sacred truth. I am not att liberty to say many things that I want
    to communicate to you. Butt the time will soon com, I hope, when we may all
    speak our minds without fear or restraint." <br><br>The letter, which
    concludes with family pleasantries and travel plans, was written to a known
    Tory, likely his brother Samuel Fitch (1724-1799), a Boston attorney.
    Despite this evidence, and having in another instance told the governor and
    council to take "his sheriff's commission and wipe there damned arses with
    it," Fitch was not brought to trial for disloyalty until September 1778.
    Even then, despite substantial evidence, he was acquitted. By this point,
    though, he was ostracized and rapidly sinking into debt. He moved to Nova
    Scotia at the end of the war. Part of this letter was published (without
    giving a source) in William Willingham's "The Strange Case of Eleazer Fitch:
    Connecticut Tory," in the Connecticut Historical Society Bulletin, July 1975
    (40:3), page 75-79.

    This pass was issued in compliance with George Washington's 25 January 1777
    order that all Americans take an oath of loyalty to the United States. He
    granted a one-month exemption for crown loyalists to relocate to
    British-held territory. The pass reads in full: <br><br>"Joshua Sulice of
    New Rochele is permited to pass to Long Island or within the enemy lines
    near New York, agreable to the orders contained in His Excellency General
    Washington's proclamation dated Jan. 25th 1777, and he is also to carry with

    and was buried there in 1799. However, at least one member of his family,
    his brother Daniel Soulice (1726-1820), was an active Loyalist who settled

    This document was issued just 4 days after the Continental Army left Valley
    Forge in pursuit of the British toward Manhattan. Just 6 days later, the two
    armies met in the Battle of Monmouth. It lists 16 "Brigades of the Grand
    Army" plus the "Staff Department," and the appointed "Receivers of Cattle"
    for each brigade. After a lean six months in camp, they may have encountered
    improved forage opportunities on the march, and welcomed a fresh supply of
    beef in their provisions. The 16 brigades listed here were all among the 18
    which spent the spring at Valley Forge. Maxwell's New Jersey Brigade had
    left Valley Forge the previous month and is not listed here. The 3rd
    Pennsylvania Brigade is not listed here for some reason, and the 1st and 2nd
    Pennsylvania Brigades had no appointed receiver of cattle--no beef for them.
    Among the listed brigade commanders are Varnum, Muhlenberg, Varnum and Knox.

    Following his service at Saratoga in the fall of 1777, Van Cortlandt was
    temporarily detached from his command to help supervise the encampment at
    Valley Forge before returning to his regiment that summer. In this account,
    Van Cortlandt is registered for reimbursement for six separate expenses
    incurred during the Continental Army's final months at Valley Forge. He had
    paid Samuel Loudon of Fishkill, NY for military printing; Lawrence Fledetner
    for repairing drums; and Sergeant Thomas Bunting for an expedition in
    pursuit of deserters. In May he claimed "expences of Several Officers from
    Valey Forge to Easton on command to receive recruits." The account concludes
    with a claim for "expences on com'd by order of Genl. Washington from Valey
    Forge to White Plains."

    In 1780, the French navy captured the HMS Unicorn, and renamed it "La
    Licorne" (French for Unicorn). This French-language account is transcribed
    from the apparently unpublished journal of the Licorne's captain. It begins
    with the Licorne being separated from its squadron off the southern coast of
    the Florida panhandle near Cape San Blas on 16 April 1781. Three days later
    a ship was spotted which was assumed to be one of the lost squadron, so
    Licorne closed in. It soon became apparent that this ship was an enemy
    British ship, but as it appeared inferior in strength, the Licorne continued
    to draw nearer, "having been well prepared for combat for a long time."
    Unleashing his first broadside, the captain was disconcerted to see that it
    had minimal effect, and that the British frigate had a surprising number of
    men aboard with superior arms. The Licorne attempted some clever maneuvers,
    but soon found most of its masts shot off. The captain concluded that "there
    was nothing left for us to do but continue such an unequal and
    disadvantageous fight to save the honor of the flag as long as possible."
    Soon enough his ship was completely helpless and he decided that "it was
    much better for the interest of the state to save the brave people who
    remained to me than to sacrifice them to a certain and inevitable loss."
    After two hours of combat he lowered the flag to bring about a cease-fire.
    Two minutes later, though, one of his cannons accidentally discharged, which
    brought a fresh onslaught from the Resource. Upon re-surrendering and being
    rowed to the Resource, the French captain was surprised to learn that his
    opposing captain had been Bartholomew Rowley (1764-1811), a youth of only 16
    years old who was descended from a long noble lineage of naval commanders.
    The narrative ended with praise for Rowley's treatment of his captives, and
    of the heroism of his own officers in a hopeless cause. La Licorne was taken
    back into the British Navy, becoming once again the HMS Unicorn.
    <br><br>Captain Rowley wrote his own short account of this battle in a 2
    June letter to Sir Peter Parker which was published in the London Gazette of
    31 July 1781 and innumerable other sources, which has been the primary (if
    not only) source of information on this naval battle. Rowley named "the
    Chevalier de St. Ture" as the commander of la Licorne, who would be the
    author of this account. As we can find no other record of St. Ture, we
    suspect the name may be incorrect. In any event, this French account far
    surpasses Rowley's account in detail. It is accompanied by a modern full
    typed transcription and English translation, from which all quotes here have
    been abstracted.

    Jonathan Lawrence (1759-1802) was an intrepid young officer who helped
    deliver dispatches to General Washington and later corresponded with him. At
    this point, he had been serving as a captain in a state militia regiment,
    and was trying to raise a company to become a captain in the Continental
    Army, in response to the governor's call for new troops. He resided in the
    village of Palisades, part of the small town of Orangetown in what soon
    became Rockland County (the docketing refers to "raising levies in
    Orangetown"), at the southernmost point of New York west of the Hudson
    River. As shown in this letter, fresh troops were hard to come
    by.<br><br>"Every endeavor in my power has been made use of to perswade the
    field officers of our militia to be speedy in raising the levies agreeable
    to the act of the Legislature, but few are classed as yet. . . . They will
    not be more than nineteen exclusive of the officers. . . . Giveing your
    Excellency an account of the low proceedings of the officers will create me
    many enemies, but as it is my duty I determined to do it. . . . I have
    several times applyd to the officer of the whale boats to go with one to
    fetch off those familys . . . could I have procured the boats only I might
    have got volunteers. . . . As it is not likely I shall have a command in the
    levies, I shall be happy Your Excellency would recommend me to Gen'l Du
    Portail for a company in his Corps of Sappers." <br><br>Lawrence was indeed
    appointed as captain in the sappers shortly thereafter. He resigned his
    commission late in 1782 due to tuberculosis contracted in his service, a
    disease which apparently ended his life at the age of 43.

    As the Treaty of Paris slowly moved through diplomatic channels, the
    thousands of anxious American Loyalists in occupied New York sought new
    homes elsewhere in the empire, with Nova Scotia being the most popular
    destination. As they departed northward, they were sometimes granted letters
    of recommendation by the British military leadership, such as this example:
    <br><br>"I beg leave to recommend to your Excellency's favourable notice and
    assistance the bearer Mr. Nemiah Haydon, who is a zealous Loyalist and has
    rendered many services to government during the late war. He intends to
    proceed from hence with several other Loyalists with him in a vessel of
    their own to Port Shelburne, where they are desirous of setling, and as they
    are chiefly ship carpenters and mean to enter into the business of ship
    building there, which may prove of great benefit to that settlement, I have
    no doubt but they will receive that protection and countenance from your
    Excellency so usefull a body of people deserve." <br><br>The Loyalist in
    question, Nehemiah Hayden (1755-1791), came from an important shipbuilding
    family in Saybrook, CT; he did indeed settle in Chester, NS and later died
    in Bermuda. <br><br>Sir Brook Watson (1735-1807), who wrote out and signed
    this file transcript, is best known for a shark attack which cost him his
    leg in 1749. In 1774, he commissioned Boston artist John Singleton Copley to
    commemorate his rescue with the now-famous painting, "Watson and the Shark."
    <br><br>The date of this letter is interesting, although just a coincidence.
    The Treaty of Paris, first drafted in November 1782, was actually signed in
    Paris on this date, 4 September 1783. However, there would have been no way
    for General Carleton to know that in New York. The final British evacuation
    took place on 25 November. <br><br>An earlier partial draft of this letter
    was abstracted in the 1909 "Report on American Manuscripts in the Royal
    Institution of Great Britain," Volume IV, page 326.

    Samuel Greene Wheeler Benjamin (1837-1914) had an eclectic career as a
    diplomat, artist, and author. Son of missionaries, he was born in Greece,
    covered the Crimean War as a young journalist before graduating from
    Williams College in 1859, painted marine landscapes, wrote and edited
    numerous works on art, especially for the Magazine of Art, and was American
    Minister to Persia from 1883 to 1885. Offered here is a scrapbook of
    Benjamin's correspondence--mostly but not exclusively from prominent
    American artists in response to his journalistic queries, 1876-1880.
    <br><br>In 1878, Benjamin had sought permission to reproduce a work by
    realist painter Thomas Eakins, possibly in the Magazine of Art. Eakins
    responds here on 1 November 1878: "I should be very pleased to have you
    reproduce my zither player or my Prof. Gross picture or a part of it or
    anything else of mine you might like. The things at William Sartain's would
    be the handiest for you to get, and I would value his judgement as to which
    one more than my own." Eakins references what is now possibly his best-known
    work, "The Gross Clinic" from 1875. <br><br>Hudson River School master
    Frederic Edwin Church replied to a similar request with a dolefully
    self-deprecating letter on 7 January 1879: "Your request for the use of a
    picture to engrave for your papers on American art ought to have a favorable
    and prompt response. . . . I possess but one of my own pictures and that one
    is not suited for black and white. I have never been accustomed to work with
    the engraver's art in view, and I must confess that my works generally are
    defective in effective treatment of light and shade. Partly in consequence
    of this, nearly all photographs of my work are absolute failures."
    <br><br>Other artists represented (in order of appearance) include George
    Henry Boughton, James Craig Nicoll (2 letters), William Morris Hunt, Robert
    Swain Gifford, David Dalhoff Neal, George Loring Brown, Albert Fitch
    Bellows, Francis Blackwell Mayer, botanical illustrator Ellen Robbins,
    Robert Walker MacBeth, western landscape artist Thomas Hill, Eastman
    Johnson, Samuel Colman, Arthur Quartley, Jervis McEntee, Sanford Robinson
    Gifford, William Rudolf O'Donovan, James D. Smillie, John Joseph Enneking,
    Titanic victim Francis Davis Millet ("Life seems too short to paint all
    there is to paint"), Charles Stanley Reinhart, sculptor Anne Whitney, James
    Carroll Beckwith, Oliver Ingraham Lay, William James Linton, Stephen James
    Ferris, Hugh Bolton Jones, Charles Henry Miller, Harry Chase, Thomas Addison
    Richards, William H. Beard (a long manuscript list of paintings),
    illustrator Mary Hallock Foote, Homer Dodge Martin, and Daniel Huntington.
    Stained glass designer Louis Comfort Tiffany invites Benjamin to
    dinner--"very informally, come in your studio clothes." <br><br>In other
    realms, James Milton Turner was the nation's first Black diplomat, serving
    as consul to Liberia from 1871 to 1878. Here he writes from the island of
    Tenerife on 7 April 1873, reporting on quarantine conditions and asking
    Benjamin to have some parcels at the Customs House "shipped to me at
    Monrovia." Benjamin also received letters from Williams College presidents
    Paul A. Chadbourne and Mark Hopkins, Smith College president Laurenus Clark
    Seelye (describing his efforts to form a world-class American art collection
    at Smith), and Bowdoin College president (and Civil War general) Joshua
    Chamberlain. Authors William Dean Howells, Elizabeth Akers Allen, and Paul
    Hamilton Hayne are also represented, as is senator (and fellow Williams
    alum) John James Ingalls.

    The pages of this notebook are filled with art, which grows increasingly
    bizarre: a pentagrammed hat over a broom titled "Witchcraft" (page 81);
    Jesus on the cross captioned "Names, Magii, Magic, wisdom or wisemen, the
    same who found Christ" (106); a suite of drawings of circus freaks including
    Siamese twins, Elephant Boy, a legless horse and a sword swallower (pages
    110-119); gartered legs and women's heads which appear to be intended as
    tattoo art (129); the psychedelic masterwork, "Ancient Mode of Worship"
    (134); a virgin having her heart ripped out with a sword in a Mexican occult
    ceremony (136); dozens of souls being burned inside a demonic creature
    called "Wicker Man . . . in time of druids in England" (137); and finally
    two pages of tortures inspired by the Spanish Inquisition (138-9).
    <br><br>The drawings are interspersed with occasional textual passages. An
    incoherent manuscript note reads "What has and does rule the world:
    mesmerism, clariavoiancy, hynatism, fire, fear, farce, and the mighty gold
    dollar." 6 pages are devoted to horoscopes (122-6). Among the more staid
    artistic compositions (most of them earlier in the volume) are a sign for
    the artist's father's (imaginary?) business, "Deerfield Farm, O.D. Philbrick
    & Sons"; a full-page landscape featuring the school in Hudson, NH; three
    fire engines titled "Philbrick Fire Co."; a crowded car on the Nashua &
    Lowell Rail Road; a Jewish junk dealer; men in military uniforms; an
    "American school teacher"; a naval vessel titled the USS Maybrick; Masonic
    emblems; Black Heart, chief of the Apaches; and a whaling scene. <br><br>Two
    names appear repeatedly throughout this album. The main artist appears to be
    Ren W. Philbrick (1888-1953). Philbrick was aged about 16 when he made these
    drawings. His father Orrin D. Philbrick was a teamster and farm laborer. Ren
    would be married by 1910 and never had children, working on odd jobs ranging
    from farm laborer to railroad shop repairman to brush burner on a
    reforestation project. The other name which appears repeatedly in the album
    is Charles H.F. Daigneault, which appears completely untraceable, though
    Daigneault is a fairly common French-Canadian surname in northern New
    England. It may well have been a fictional persona adopted by Philbrick.

    the 1861 city directory, and at 225 Montgomery in the 1862 and 1863
    directories. From 1864 onward Ellery was listed as engaged in selling his
    own patent rubber cement, or as a real estate and mining investor. He moved
    across the bay to Alameda in 1867, where he spent his remaining 47 years.
    <br><br>Offered here is the county license issued to "E Ellery . . . to
    transact the business of books in Washington Street" for the preceding three
    months, for which he paid $7.50. It is signed by 3 local officials and dated
    8 March 1856. Also included is an illustrated billhead for his "Antiquarian
    Book Store, 225 Montgomery Street, Importer and Dealer in New and
    Second-Hand Books, Stationery, Blank Books, Sheet Music, &c." It apparently
    documents his own company's $50 payment to Ellery as secretary of the
    "Antiquarian S.M. Co.," dated 12 May 1864--about the same time the book
    store disappeared from the city directories. <br><br>With--a group of 60 of

    Our correspondent was working out a new mechanical process for gold mining
    on a promising site. However, his partner Eric had given power of attorney
    to an investor named Wyckoff who is described as "a snoty little devil" who
    "knows no more about a mine or my affairs than a jack rabbit," but was
    starving the operation of cash while delivering a steady stream of insults.
    At one point he "left me without cash for ten days when we had nothing but
    potatoes to feed in the camp." Wyckoff is also suspected of trying to steal
    the proprietary process, which had already yielded fruit in Mexico. If that
    wasn't bad enough, the author was in poor health--passing blood, suffering
    from continuous headaches, and feeling faint. And yet, as with any mining
    venture, a fortune was just around the corner: "I will make you money in the
    mine and prove the process, so we can get bigger mines. Everybody is
    gold-crazy over here." Someone familiar with the history of Oroville mining
    might be able to identify the author.

    These placards were created at the Douglas School, a public elementary
    school in Harvey Milk's Castro neighborhood. Milk fought to keep the school
    open although most of the gay residents of the Castro did not have children.
    One placard, presumably created for a Saint Patrick's Day celebration during
    Milk's lifetime, reads "Supervisor Harvey O'Milk" in bold green letters
    (circa 1978?). The other, probably created shortly after his death, is
    headed "In memory of our good friend and neighbor, Harvey Milk. We will
    always remember with thanks his support and caring. From the children,
    faculty and parents of Douglas School." It is followed by the signatures of
    approximately 200 children, filling the remainder of the first board and
    most of a second. The school has since been renamed the Harvey Milk Civil

    Probably the most notable photograph in this volume is a Mathew Brady studio
    portrait of the shadowy United States military intelligence leader, Colonel
    Lafayette Curry Baker (1826-1868). It is inscribed on verso "Presented me by
    Mrs. Col. L.C. Baker, June 8 / 65." Soon after the war, Baker became
    enmeshed in a variety of scandals and was fired for spying on President
    Johnson. A conspiracy theory alleges that he was then poisoned for his
    inside knowledge of the Lincoln assassination. <br><br>The volume was kept
    by John Augustine Stambach (1840-1916), a Philadelphia hatter and furrier
    who served as a private in a Pennsylvania regiment. One photograph,
    captioned "Ida," is likely his sister Ida Valerie Stambach (1853-1926), an
    early female medical school graduate who later practiced in California.
    Among the 7 photographs of uniformed soldiers in the album, one is inscribed
    by "Capt. S.J. Kiffer"[?] on recto. Notable figures include Samuel Morse,
    Horace Greeley, and Abraham Lincoln (a photograph of an engraving).

    While other similar satires were published about "Abraham of the House of

    Lloyd Willis Manning (1837-1883) was a private in Company I of the 3rd
    Massachusetts Heavy Artillery, which specialized in building pontoon
    bridges. His company arrived in the rebel capitol just two days after Union
    troops took possession: "We arrived here at half past nine, within a short
    distance of the Rebel capitol. . . . President Lincoln went up ahead of us.
    His carriage is here at the wharf, and he is up to Old Jeff's House. . . .
    You have no idea how the colored people welcome the Yanks. Lincoln has just
    gone down the river on a small boat. More than five hundred women and
    children have come flocking down here to the wharf to see him." Manning also
    describes evidence of the chaos which enveloped the city during the rebel
    evacuation: "I am told by the cittizens that while the fight was going on at
    Petersburg, Gen. Lee telegraphed to Jeff that Grant had broken their lines
    and that they must evacuate R immediately, so there was no time to take off
    their big guns. He told them to take what stores they could, and throw the
    doors open and let the poor have the rest. . . . They say that Jeff was here
    Sunday morning but went off in a special train. . . . These bridges that
    they burned was ordered to be burned by Gen. Ewel. He said burn them if it
    burned the whole citty, and it was in great danger. The poor people are
    suffering for food. A horse cost three thousand dollars here in their
    money."

    A history of the Confederate guerrilla Champ Ferguson (1821-1865) who
    terrorized Tennessee, allegedly killing more than 100 Unionists including
    civilians. The author gives several detailed examples, and celebrates
    Ferguson's eventual execution as a war criminal. The last 14 pages are
    devoted to Ferguson's old compatriots who became active in the local Ku Klux
    Klan after the war, with detailed documentation of their atrocities.
    <br><br>The author Jonathan D, Hale was a local enemy of Ferguson who
    published at least three similar but distinct pamphlets on the subject:
    "Champ Furguson: A Sketch of the War in East Tennessee" in 1862 (20 pages);
    "Champ Furguson: The Border Rebel, and Thief, Robber & Murderer" in 1864 (24
    pages); and the present undated work which includes references through 1869.
    This latest version was credited only to "One Who Has Seen and Felt," but is
    credited to Hale by OCLC (5 copies traced). The present copy was Hale's own,
    and bears extensive notes for a planned 4th Ferguson pamphlet, including
    points of substance and style. A note on page 6 reads "notes, 4th edition"
    and several passages are noted as "already set up" (in type). On page 37,
    the pamphlet describes an old enslaved man who had been killed by Ferguson
    after he grew too old to work. Here, a note in blue pencil reads "He often
    came to our mills previous to the war. J.D. Hale." OCLC calls for 2
    unnumbered pages at the end, so a final leaf may be lacking here. 5 of this
    edition in OCLC and none traced at auction.

    A committee composed mostly of Confederate enlisted men drafted these
    resolutions of patriotism in the wake of the failed Hampton Roads peace
    conference of 3 February 1865. They resolve to continue "the maintenance of
    this struggle for independence, . . . determined to contest until the bitter
    end." They describe the Union army as "a crafty, cruel and merciless foe . .
    . were he to come with the Bible in one hand, we would look for the dagger
    in the other." They join with President Davis in rejection of the peace
    terms, and place their faith in "the great and glorious Lee--the Christian
    gentleman and chivalrous soldier" to "eventually lead us forth to victory,
    honor and liberty." The resolutions close with a postscript which urges that
    they be published--"when you present them to Congress, please say that they
    were adopted near a month ago." The minutes of the Confederate House of
    Representatives for 28 February 1865 note the receipt of "certain patriotic

    First edition, with at least one other issued later in Virginia. The land
    agent Cornelius Boyle was a Confederate officer who, like many others,
    crossed the border at the conclusion of the war and tried to start over as a
    Mexican land speculator. The land he promotes here covered 575,640 acres on
    Mexico's Pacific coast in the state of Nayarit, about 50 miles north of
    Puerto Vallarta. Testimonial letters assert that the land is well suited for
    cotton cultivation, and that "nature has done its utmost to make of this
    country a paradise, and only the hands of an industrious Anglo-Saxon
    population is required to develop it." We are assured repeatedly, however,
    that those industrious Anglo-Saxon hands will not be required to do any

    Dabney Rainey (1835-1870) of North Carolina settled in Brazil before the
    Civil War, helping with his brother Thomas Rainey's transportation business.
    After the war ended, he found himself in the vanguard of an influx of
    Confederate refugees--Os Confederados--looking to start over in a nation
    which still practiced slavery. This letter expresses his frustration with
    some of the newcomers: "We have had a great maney southern men here looking
    for homes, but very few of them are satisfied, and very nearly all have gone
    home or to some other country. . . . One of them has settled here. His
    hatred of the U.S. has induced him to do so. He says if he were bound for
    Hell from here, and had three weeks furlow in the U.S. that he would not
    stop, but go on to hell. God only knows what is to become of many of the
    poor devils which have come here." Discussing local conditions, he notes
    that "Brazilian money is very much depreciated on account of the Paraguayan
    War. The Paraguayans have been threshing them like Old Nick lately, and I
    would not care a tinker's --- if they were to kill the whole race."

    Thomas W. Kizer (1824-1901) was a farmer from Winchester, IN who was active

    which had recently been surrendered by the Confederacy: "We will start down

    and to get a lot of sick men." <br><br>Kizer also describes a visit to the

    in 1863. The regiment's first posting was on guard duty near Baton Rouge,
    where his first 5 letters were written. Shortly after his arrival on the
    banks of the Mississippi on 22 March, he wrote "A party of slave hunters
    passed our camp on horse back. They all had knives and revolvers, and they
    were a hard-looking set of fellows. In a little while they came back with
    negro in tow. When they got to our camp, we took the darkey away from them
    and sent him home, and told the slave catchers to make themselves scarce."
    On 3 April he wrote: "We saw the rebel general Johnson's plantations. It is
    a splendid place. He used to keep a 1000 niggers, but it is deserted now."
    On 29 April he noted "The're raising nigger reg's here fast as they can.
    They can drill as well and are just as good soldiers as whites. The're as
    proud as peacocks to get a uniform on." <br><br>Graham's 30 May letter was
    written shortly after the regiment's first combat: the 27 May assault on
    Port Hudson, LA. Union troops had surrounded the fort over the previous five
    days, and an assault on the fort's northern defenses had failed that
    morning. Graham was part of Dudley's brigade which made an assault on the
    eastern defenses that afternoon: "The battle commenced at half past one and
    lasted till dark, killing 75 and wounding 250. . . . The artillery was most
    deafening. We didn't succeed in taking the fort, but got whipped. The 116
    N.Y. and 30 Mass lost most. It is miraculous how our reg. came out so lucky.
    Our major came near being killed twice. He was leading the men onto the
    field when a solid shot struck at his feet, covering him all over dirt and
    most knocking him down, and a shell burst over his head but didn't hurt
    him." After that, the Union forces dug in for a siege: "On the morning of
    the 28th, some Rebs came out of the fort on a scout and our folks took them,
    75 of them and captains and a col. They were a hard-looking set of fellows.
    . . . Contrabands come in every day. . . . I went down to the hospital (if
    you can call it a hospital) to see the wounded. They lay there on the ground
    under the trees, wounded in every place imaginable. Doctor Cogswell does all
    the amputating. Yesterday, they buried 14 legs and 11 arms that was taken
    off." <br><br>Accompanying the letters are: stamped and cancelled postal
    cover with two illustrations of the Volunteer Refreshment Saloon in
    Philadelphia; an illustrated folding card to advertise the Volunteer
    Refreshment Saloon; program for "Complimentary Dinner to the Fiftieth
    Regiment, Massachusetts Militia" at the Refreshment Saloon, Philadelphia, 1

    The author, Louis Brooks Parmalee (1817-1873), was a New Jersey-born
    merchant and apparently a Unionist, though in Missouri in this period it is
    sometimes difficult to determine who is on which side. He writes to a friend
    in Union Iowa: "Saturday a part of the company to which Slane & Ely Bertrum
    belonged left St. Jo to join Glover. Bertrum, two Dutchmen, and one by the
    name of Stoner got off at Shelbina to stop at home for a few days. . . .
    Nearly sundown Bertram and one of the Dutchmen walking together, Stoner &
    the other a little behind them, when bang bang bang went sum guns close to
    them. Three of them got over the fence as soon as possable. Tthe Dutchman
    had a shot gun and one of the others a pistol. . . . Burtram cums home,
    sends for Dr. Preast to pick out sum shot out of him, one in the face left
    side, one in the left arm. . . . The Dutchman that was with Burtrum was
    badly shot in the sholder with a ball and other parts with shot. . . .
    George Galashy, Arch Brant, Hite Shakelford left about a month ago with
    George's niggers expecting to go south, found it rather inconvenient to
    cross the Missouri. . . . Last Friday week there was a returning Pike's
    Peaker passed through town with four mules & a wagon. As he got neer Waren,
    two took advantage of him and shot him, so he has since died. . . . You
    perseive from these things that we have not as quiet times here as we should
    have. Bushwhackers are passing and repassing from day to day in town, but do
    not get molested here in the least."

    This apparently unpublished diary was kept by the chief engineer of the USS
    Dacotah, a steam sloop which began at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. It arrived for
    duty in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron on 13 March 1862, just 5 days
    after the Battle of Hampton Roads: "Heard for the first time the news of the
    terrible encounter between the Merrimac (rebel) and Cumberland and Congress
    (Federal), also the timely intervention of the Monitor. We all listened with
    much attention to account of the battle, and the glorious and noble, and the
    never before equalled bravery and heroism of officers and crew of the
    Cumberland. She sank with her crew still at and firing her guns, and still
    the noble and unpolluted ensign of our country waves from her masthead" (13
    March). For the first two months of the diary, the main character is not a
    person but rather that enemy ship: the ironclad CSS Virginia, here described
    as "the Merrimac," which is mentioned more than 40 times over the next two
    months. Every day was lived in expectation of a battle with the dreaded
    ironclad. On 18 March he wrote "We have just received orders in the event
    the enemy again appears, and we get a chance at them, we are to run them
    down at full speed. . . . I think we shall cleave her sure if once an
    opportunity offers." On 29 March he worried: "In carrying out the orders we
    now have, to run her down at full speed, at the same time we all expect to
    be compelled to take to the water for the want of a ship to hold us. . . .
    Sweethearts and wives have been drank to." The men debated "how soon they
    will remove their boots as soon as she begins to go down rapidly." The
    Merrimac was gradually bottled in upriver, and this tale ended on 11 May at
    Norfolk with its self-destruction: "This morning at three o'clock the
    Merrimac was discovered on fire. Soon the flames spread over her entire
    length, enshrouding her in one sheet of fire. . . . At 4:54 a.m. the entire
    mass of flame, a great portion of her iron sheathing, &c., were seen to
    ascend high into the heavens, presenting one of the most magnificent
    pyrotechnical views I ever beheld. With this explosion the Merrimac was no
    more. Not a vestige of her was left." Bookending this first-hand report is a
    long second-hand discussion of the loss of the USS Monitor at sea in the 3
    January 1863 entry. <br><br>The Dacotah had two close encounters with
    President Lincoln. While still on the hunt for the Merrimac, our diarist
    wrote: "The president looked on at the bombardment with aparent great
    interest and felt a great anxiety for our side. He passed close to our
    vessel, bowed, and moved on with his little tug. His pleasing countenance
    indicated entire satisfaction with the day's bombarding" (8 May 1862). Two
    months later, the author reported his ship at anchor at Harrison's Landing
    "in front of Gen. McClellan's headquarters, but a few hundred yards from us.
    Several balloons were sent up to make observations. The president visited
    the Gen. incog., and witnessed the balloon reconnaissance. . . . It is
    reported that the president made an ascension with the balloon" (8 July
    1862). Lincoln did indeed visit that day, although the balloon ascension
    seems to have been just a wild rumor. <br><br>Another recurring theme of the
    diary is encounters with recently enslaved people. On 12 May, the author
    learns that the local Norfolk women "went so far as to tell the poor deluded
    beings that the Yankees would bridle them and put the bit in their mouths
    and drive them like oxen or horses, and haul stone." Several "contrabands"
    reported for duty on the Dacotah on 28 June: "All are well pleased so far
    with their new vocation, and are also uncontrolably proud of Uncle Sam's
    uniform. Their duties on board will be in a great measure menial." In 12
    August he wrote "Rec'd on board one contraband. He tells his tale like all
    the others. This fellow says he left his master to avoid a flogging. The
    provocation not being sufficiently great to warrant it according to his
    estimation, he thought he would skedaddle. I learned that the plantation
    from which we foraged has lost some two hundred negroes. They are now with
    the army, digging trenches." <br><br>The diarist at no point signs his name,
    but has been identified as Philip G. Peltz (1832-1868), a Philadelphia
    native who remained in the Navy after the war. The author announces the
    proud receipt of his chief engineer's commission in his 4 May 1862 entry
    while serving aboard the Dacotah; Peltz was named as chief engineer of this
    ship in the 8 February 1862 Philadelphia Enquirer. The diarist makes two
    mentions of his brother, a naval assistant surgeon, on 29 August 1862 and
    upon his brother's appointment to the gunboat Chocura on 20 February. Philip
    Peltz's brother Samuel H. Peltz (1838-1865) was the assistant surgeon aboard
    the Chocura until his transfer (Washington Evening Star, 29 September 1863).
    <br><br>This well-written and extensive diary is a fresh new source on the
    best-known naval theater of the war, with the eyewitness account of the
    Merrimac's destruction being only one of many highlights.

    Christopher Flood (1829-1899) of Morrisania, NY joined the Navy as an ensign
    in November 1862. He served aboard the USS Savannah, Columbine, Fernandina,
    Harvest Moon, and Norfolk Packet. Included in this lot are his original
    appointment letter, and his 9 June 1865 promotion letter to Acting Master,
    both signed by Navy Secretary Gideon Welles. Two letters are signed by
    Admiral John A. Dahlgren: ordering a ship to assist a "topographical party
    of the Coast Survey in extending the survey of Ossabaw to McAllister, and
    other works erected by the rebels" (1 February 1865) and ordering Flood to
    prepare the USS Norfolk Packet for the journey north as Acting Master (9
    June 1865). Flood's list of provisions for this voyage is also included. A
    long semi-personal letter from a fellow officer aboard the USS Fernandina
    dated February 1864 (signature illegible) was written while he was on leave,
    describing the remaining officers as a "forlorn body" and the recent
    torpedoing of the USS Housatonic as "tough work, there is no mistake." Most
    notably, the lot includes an attractively hand-painted photograph of Flood
    in his Navy uniform as ensign, 7½ x 5¾ inches oval to sight in a repaired
    period frame (14 x 12½ inches), labelled on verso "My father Christopher
    Flood, Civil War veteran, M.A.W." After the war, Flood was a marshal for the

    The 22nd Regiment of the National Guard of New York saw several short stints
    of active duty during the Civil War. Before they were called up, they wore
    gray uniforms trimmed in red, with a small "22" on their hats and the
    company letter on their belt buckle. They did garrison duty at Harper's
    Ferry in May 1862, during which many of them were photographed. Shortly
    after their return to New York, in September 1862, they switched to a more
    standard blue Union uniform for obvious reasons. This photograph shows 3
    privates of the regiment's Company G, said to be brothers from the Hyde
    family. Edwin Francis Hyde (1842-1933) mustered in with Company G in May
    1862; later photographs bear an unmistakable similarity to the soldier on
    the right in this photograph. His brother Augustus Lord Hyde also served in
    the regiment. For discussion of the uniform, see Michael J. McAfee,

    An apparently unpublished history by the commander of the 81st New York
    Infantry, Colonel Jacob J. DeForest (1820-1904). The Oswego-based regiment
    saw its first heavy combat in McClellan’s Peninsular Campaign of mid-1862,
    including Yorktown, Williamsburg, Bottoms Bridge, Savage Station, Seven
    Pines, Malvern Hill and Fair Oaks, where Colonel DeForest was wounded in the
    chest. DeForest rues the army's retreat: “Had the Commander of the Army
    [McClellan] pressed the enemy into Richmond instead of faltering and finally
    retreating back to the cover of his gun boats on the James River, the
    situation would have been very different.” In contract, DeForest calls
    General Grant a “bull dog fighter.” At Cold Harbor, as the 81st lost their
    entire color guard, and thirteen commissioned officers, with “two thirds of
    its numerical strength . . . swept from the ranks. . . . Lieut. J.W. Burk,
    standing near my side, was pierced by a ball from a sharp-shooter directly
    through the head between the eyes.” At Fort Harrison, “81st colors were the
    first ones planted on the rebel fort, taking two redoubts, several pieces of
    artillery, large number of prisoners, and one battle flag.” In Richmond in
    April 1865, they were “the first infantry regiment to enter the rebel
    Capital and its commanding officer released the Union prisoners from Libby
    Prison and filled it with as many rebels as it would hold, locked its doors
    and put the key in his pocket, and has it now in his safe keeping.” He
    closes by noting proudly that the colors of the 81st “were never in the
    hands of the enemy,” despite the fact that “on several occasions the color
    guard were swept out of existence.”

    George Knapp Collins (1837-1931) was raised in Syracuse, NY and spent most
    of the war with the 149th New York Infantry. After the war he was a prolific
    author of local and military history. This unpublished novel was apparently
    his only venture into fiction, but he did not venture far. Pages 77 to 158
    are dedicated to the central character's military service as colonel of a
    regiment much like the author's own. He is wounded at Gettysburg, and then
    rejoins his regiment to aid in the relief of the besieged Union forces at
    Chattanooga, setting up the titular "Cracker Line" to deliver supplies
    through the mountains. He sends detailed reports back to his mother, who
    reads them aloud at a local literary society (pages 106-158). These passages
    cross the line into military history, offering numerous details of the
    Chattanooga Campaign, including the battles of Wauhatchie, Lookout Mountain
    and Missionary Ridge. The regiment is unnamed, but belongs to the New York
    Brigade in the 12th Army Corps--not coincidentally the same brigade in which

    Samuel Whitfield Folsom (1844-1929) was born and raised in Cleveland, OH ,
    son of a prosperous early settler. When the war broke out, he was just
    starting a long career as an accountant, and joined an Ohio National Guard
    unit. As his diary begins in January 1864, he attends a variety of cultural
    events in Cleveland. On 21 February he writes: "Heard Frederick Douglas
    deliver a lecture on the ‘Mishions of the War.’ I enjoyed it very much.
    Douglas displays very fine powers of oratory and has a head that looks as
    though it might contain a great deal of knowledge.” On 26 April, he began a
    new position in Meadville, PA as private secretary to the president of the
    Atlantic & Great Western Railroad. 4 days later, he wrote: “Received an
    order . . . to report at the Armory, Cleveland, 10 o’clock A.M., the
    National Guards (to which I belong) having been called out for 100 days. I
    telegraphed home to inquire if Father had procured a substitute for me.
    Rec’d an ans., ‘No.’”<br><br>Folsom's diary of his experience as a private
    in the 150th Ohio Infantry is well-written and legible, with a full entry
    for each day. His company spent the entire period in the defenses of
    Washington, mostly shuttling back and forth between Forts Stevens and Bunker
    Hill. He spent 7 June on picket duty on the property of Lincoln's cabinet
    member Montgomery Blair: “Have been furnished with all the milk we could
    drink from Postmaster Blair.” On 14 June he wrote : "Attended a picnic by
    colored people held in a grove nearby. They had dancing, with pretty good
    music. Had a good opertunity of judging the character of these people. I
    took strawberries at their tables for refreshments.” <br><br>His closest
    brush with combat was the Battle of Fort Stevens, part of which he was able
    to observe from nearby Fort Bunker Hill: “This morning heard very heavy
    firing of musketry & cannon. Think Rebels have made a charge on Ft. Stevens.
    Was relieved from picket 8 a.m., found a good deal of excitement among the
    boys at the fort. They have slept side of the cannons for two nights. There
    has been pretty hard fighting at Fort Stevens all day. . . . Rebels left
    Fort Stevens last night. We saw most of the fighting yesterday from our
    fort. Expected the Rebs would attack this fort last night. . . . Saw a cloud
    of dust north of here & I went with 6 others & Lieut. on a scouting
    expedition, found it to be a large force of Rebs on the retreat" (12-13
    July). Over the next week, Folsom made two visits to the battleground to
    hunt for relics, noting that he "saw the several graves of the Rebels, one
    containing 17, one 37, another 2, & several single graves” (17 July).
    <br><br>Folsom soon mustered out, but his diaries continue through the end
    of 1866. He describes the scene in Meadville on the eve of Election Day in
    1864: “Democratic meeting here today. The Union party played a good joke on
    the McClellanites. Last night they made a battery in the square & placed a
    Quaker gun pointing towards the square. Upon the battery was written
    Manassas. I never saw so many intoxicated here before today" (2 November).
    Additional notes on his diaries are available upon request.<br><br>Folsom
    was a good amateur draftsman, and sent home 5 pieces from his wartime
    service: a detailed drawing of a highway turnpike gatehouse in Washington
    where he did picket duty, described in his diary on 17 June 1864; a view of
    the barracks at Fort Bunker Hill (noted in his diary on 8 July 1864);
    detailed plans of Forts Bunker Hill and Stevens; and finally a map of the
    Battle of Fort Stevens, some of which he had witnessed. It shows the
    location of the Union and Rebel skirmishers north of the fort, the other
    forts comprising the northern defenses of Washington, the home of Montgomery
    Blair where he had previously been on picket duty, and the location where
    Folsom was on picket not far from the start of the fighting.<br><br>Finally,
    the collection includes 69 letters addressed to Folsom during the war years
    by friends and family members, most of them in Cleveland. Two are on
    patriotic letterhead. Many of the letters are from his sister Hadassah, a
    Cleveland educator who wrote regularly during his months at the front.

    Cotter's Battery was formed in Ravenna, OH as a 3-month regiment in the
    early months of the war, and then re-upped for 3 years as Battery A of the
    1st Ohio Light Artillery. Charles Sumner Cotter (1828-1886), author of this
    letter, was the captain of the battery. He writes: "We are at Green River,
    where Buckner (the rebel genl) blew up the RR bridge. It was a beautiful
    structure of iron, one thousand yards from bank to bank. . . . He blew up
    one pier and destroyed two spands of the bridge and took all the track from
    the rest. . . . We have had several skirmishes with our picketts but have
    never come in range of my peices untill last Tuesday. They came up in force
    to attack us and prevent us from repairing rail road bridge. We had one regt
    of infantry acrost the river. They charged on them with the Texan Rangers
    but they were repulsed and I opened two of my peices on them with shell. . .
    . Their was fifty-four of the rebels killed and left on the field. . . . We
    lost sixteen killed." He also describes the battery's new flag given by the
    ladies of Louisville. Captain Cotter served for the entirety of the war and
    mustered out as a colonel.

    Theodore Longwood (1843-1877) was serving in the 20th Indiana Infantry when
    captured at Weldon Railroad in 1864. He was exchanged from a Confederate
    prison and (like many exchanged Union soldiers) sent to a Union parole camp
    at Camp Chase in Columbus, OH. In this letter, Longwood grumbles that after
    the fighting ceased, "the officers are not in any hurry about getting out of
    the service, so they want to keep us as long as possible." A small group of
    parolees escaped through the stockade fence and enjoyed an evening in town.
    Emboldened, "the proled men thought they had been in prison long enough, so
    on last Tuesday eve we thought we would show the millitias that we would not
    be guarded so close, so we got about 500 paroles together and went with a
    yell for the stockade and we was successful, for we knocked two or three
    holes in it that you could drive a eight horse teem through. So when we went
    out and stayed as long as we wanted to, we come back. Since then, the Gen.
    lets some go out every day. We got one man wounded in the leg, so that was
    the last battle we was in. It is called the Battle of Camp Chase, Ohio, one
    of the most successful of the war." <br><br>The generally accepted last land
    skirmish of the Civil War was at Palmito Ranch, TX on 13 May, so if you
    count this Battle of Camp Chase as a real battle, it would be one for the
    record books. You shouldn't count it--but it's a fun story.

    naval attack. A Committee of Public Safety was formed to create a home-guard

    In 1690, Maine was a frontier part of the colony of Massachusetts, and the
    front line in King William's War. The region was subject to frequent raids
    by the French and their Indian allies. Just in the preceding year, English
    settlers had suffered heavy losses at Dover, NH; Saco, ME; Pemaquid
    (Bristol), ME; Falmouth (Portland), ME; and Salmon Falls (Berwick), ME, with
    many taken prisoner. The frontier was rapidly becoming depopulated of
    Englishmen, pushing the front line ever closer to Boston. This document is a
    report by two important citizens of Salem, MA who were sent to Maine to
    advise on defenses. <br><br>The commissioners offered a 6-point plan to
    local Maine officials. First, they urged a need to maintain civil
    government, in order to serve as a "a terror to evell doers and a prayse to
    them that doe well." They also urged that "in millitary concerns that theire
    be due care taken in watchin & wardinge that you may not be surprised by the
    enemy & suddenly destroyed as other playses have been. That you draw your
    selves into soe fewe garrissons and soe conveniently situate as you may be
    in a good poster of defense. That a convenient number of the inhabitance
    that know ye countrey be imployed by turns in constant scoutinge. That a
    sutable party or partyes be sent forth to distress and attauqt the ennemy at
    theire usuall fisshinge places or els wheare as theire may be oppertunitye."
    <br><br>In short, they urged that the few remaining inhabitants gather
    together in small well-fortified groups, from which they could take the
    offensive against Indians with surprise sorties. The advice was either not
    heeded or insufficient. Just two weeks later came the Battle of Falmouth, in
    which 200 inhabitants of what is now Portland were massacred, and a hundred
    more taken captive. <br><br>The two commissioners who delivered this report
    would very soon play a bigger role in history as judges in the Salem witch
    trials of 1692. John Hathorne (1641-1717), great-great-grandfather of author
    Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Jonathan Corwin (1640-1718) worked together to take
    the preliminary testimony which launched the case; Corwin's house is now a
    museum known as the Witch House. The horrors of war so nearby on the
    frontier are sometimes cited as part of the context for the witch hysteria.
    <br><br>Another version of this manuscript (with nearly identical content
    but a different set of creative phonetic spellings) is transcribed in under
    the title "Report of John Hathorn and Jonath. Corwin, commisionated to visit
    the eastern parts," in Documentary History of the State of Maine, Volume 5,
    pages 92-93. While the date is partially illegible in the present document,
    it is given there as 1 May 1690. <br><br>This report is a powerful reminder
    of the fear which gripped the frontier of northern New England during this
    period, with an unusual connection to the witch trials which began less than
    two years later.

    This letter was written as governor of Maryland, and is apparently addressed
    to Sir William Johnson, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Sharpe writes a
    few months after the extended peace conference held with the Six Nations
    tribes at Lancaster, PA. Apparently, the Six Nations had made some kind of
    trade overtures with the Maryland colony. Sharpe discusses his formal
    response (not included), and asks Johnson to send it to the Six Nations
    along with a wampum belt. Sharpe doesn't sound optimistic about the trade
    prospects: "As no Indian trade hath been carried on from this province for
    some time, it would not be possible for me to purchase any wampum here, and
    indeed . . . the postage of it would amount to more than a belt's value. I
    do not think our Assembly will ever be persuaded to cultivate the Indian
    friendship."<br><br>Provenance: Sotheby's sale, 23 April 1982; Swann sale,

    Offered here is one of thousands of small steps on the path toward the
    ratification of the United States Constitution--one which demonstrates the
    influence which a common citizen had on the process. On 19 October 1787, the
    Connecticut Assembly ordered a town-by-town vote for delegates to a state
    constitutional convention. The present notice was issued two weeks later in
    Middletown, CT. The town selectmen ordered the constable to summon all
    qualified inhabitants to "meet at the town house in said Middletown on the
    second Monday of November instant at one o'clock in the afternoon for the
    purpose of choosing delegates agreeable to act of Assembly in Oct. last, and
    to do any other business necessary." The delegate vote was held as ordered
    on 12 November, setting up a final vote on 9 January 1788. Their result was
    not much in doubt, as the two-house Congress (Senate and House of
    Representatives) had been calibrated specifically to satisfy Connecticut and
    other smaller states. Connecticut became the fifth state to ratify the
    Constitution, by a vote of 128 to 40.

    Custer's official August 1874 dispatches from his Black Hills expedition.
    Here Custer writes: "Gold has been found at several places . . . I have upon
    my table forty or fifty small particles of pure gold . . . most of it
    obtained to-day from one panful of earth." His second report elaborates: "It
    has not required an expert to find gold in the Black Hills, as men without
    former experience in mining have discovered it at an expense of but little
    time or labor." This news unsurprisingly launched a gold rush, and the
    resulting tensions with the Sioux led to Custer's death at Little Bighorn
    less than two years later.

    Charles Albert Varnum (1849-1936) was Custer's commander of scouts at Little
    Bighorn, surviving the fight alongside the Reno-Benteen detachment. He
    remained in the army and retired as a colonel at the end of World War One.
    By the time of his death, he was the last surviving officer from Little
    Bighorn. He wrote this letter in response to Frederic F. Van de Water's book
    "Glory-Hunter: A Life of General Custer" (see above), the first to examine
    Custer critically. <br><br>"I received the copy of 'Glory Hunter' in due
    time. . . . At my eighty-five years of age I am not always in condition to
    think or write. I . . . have read it & enjoyed it. I agree with the author's
    comments on the General's actions & his dividing his command. Had the
    Indians captured the pack train we would all have lost our lives. Saving
    that & uniting with Benteen saved us. What might have happened if Terry with

    First edition, with others following in 1779 and 1782. The author was a
    Huguenot immigrant who joined the Quakers and became one of the leading
    early abolitionists in America. In 1770 he founded a "Negro School" in
    Philadelphia, and in 1775 he was a leading organizer of the first
    anti-slavery organization in America, the Society for the Relief of Free
    Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage. This spelling book contains little
    overtly abolitionist material, but it is "particularly calculated for the
    use of parents, guardians and others, remote from schools; in the private
    tuition of their children, and illiterate domesticks." The content includes
    vocabulary lists and short sentences, working up to more complex essays. A
    catechism near the end asks "Who is our neighbor, whom we must love?" The
    answer is "We are to love all men. . . . The Indians and Ethiopians or
    Negroes are consequently our neighbors, our brethren, whom we are enjoined
    to love as ourselves." Bristol B4181; Rosenbach, Early American Children's

    Aaron Daggett (1837-1938) had served as a Union general in the Civil War. At
    this writing, he had recently been appointed as colonel of the 14th United
    States Infantry, passing through Hawaii en route to the Philippines. He
    arrived on 2 July, and wrote "How strange that we should have arrived just
    in season to witness what, it is said, can never again occur on these
    islands, a funeral of the last of the original of the royal family. It was
    gorgeous, beautiful in many aspects, and interesting to all. . . . A weird
    atmosphere seemed to pervade the ceremonies, but they were mostly those of
    the Episcopal Church." He added that "we are all enjoying ourselves by
    visiting the town . . . and, I fear, will be overwhelmed by proffered
    hospitalities." <br><br>Hawaii became a territory of the United States in
    1898. The Dowager Queen Kapi'olani, widow of Hawaii's King Kalakaua, had

    Only the second book published for a Jewish audience in America--and the
    first Jewish calendar. It also includes the calculations to determine “the
    Hour to commence the Sabbath, in the City of New-York. . . . It may, with a
    small variation, answer well for all the Northern States of America.” The
    author Moses Lopez (1739-1830) was a member of the important Jewish
    community at Newport, RI, the nephew of wealthy merchant Aaron Lopez. The
    community went into rapid decline after the American Revolution, and Moses
    was said to be the last Jewish resident until he ultimately departed for New
    York in 1822. Goldman, page II:1166 (discussing the present copy in his
    "Manuscripts" appendix, with 4 illustrations); Rosenbach 135; Singerman
    0163. <br><br>Provenance: inscribed by original owner Jacob I. Cohen
    (1744-1829) in 5566 (1806 CE) on leaves B1-2; gift from Jacob I. Cohen
    (1744-1829) to his nephew Jacob I. Cohen Jr. (1789-1869) in 1808, per
    inscription on the final blank. The nephew was one of the leaders in the
    fight to secure passage in 1825 of the "Jew Bill," which allowed Jews to
    hold public office in Maryland; he then gained election to the Baltimore
    City Council the following year. He brought his large Jewish book collection
    to his new home at 415 North Charles Street, where the collection and
    various family members remained for very close to a hundred years. This book
    was sold at the auction of his niece Bertha Cohen (1838-1929) as detailed in
    the catalog "Antique Furnishings of the Cohen House," Baltimore, 13 November
    1929, lot 380 (Cohen sale noted in pencil on final blank).

    First edition. This is the first translation of the five books of the Torah
    by a Jewish translator into English, with text in Hebrew and English on
    facing pages. Previous editions published by Jews in England had simply
    utilized the King James translation. <br><br>The translator was Isaac Leeser
    (1806-1868), who worked without assistance. In his preface, he apologizes
    for any errors: "How can it be expected that I should escape, when I have no
    Jewish compositors, and have necessarily to be often away when the work goes
    to press?" Despite these obstacles, Leeser doubted that "the precious word
    of God ever appeared among us in a more beautiful form than the volumes in
    which I am now engaged." Leeser avoided reliance on earlier English
    translations, though he made some use of German translations, and noted that
    "the arrangement is strictly Jewish. My intention was to furnish a book for
    the service of the Synagogue, both German and Portuguese." Goldman 7; Hills

    Ward was chosen as their founding president, and future congressman Samuel
    Hoar as their secretary. <br><br>This organization was part of the first

    sitting, but tricked young Tad Lincoln into bringing his father to the
    balcony. "Posing just to please his son, Lincoln appears preoccupied and
    perhaps a little annoyed"--Hamilton and Ostendorf, Lincoln in Photographs,

    In April 1865, the great Civil War photographer Alexander Gardner was
    commissioned to photograph the surviving Lincoln assassination conspirators
    aboard the USS Montauk and Saugus at the Washington Navy Yard. Gardner found
    it necessary to have them retouched for distribution as cartes-de-visite.
    Offered here are the original retouched photographs which were reproduced
    for distribution under Gardner's copyright in 1865. The retouching has been
    attributed to Washington artist Eleazer Hutchinson Miller (1831-1921), who
    did at least one other project for Gardner during this period (an original
    cartoon titled "The Devil To Pay" in 1866). <br><br>This lot includes the

    Wiest copied this composition from a popular 1801 print, "The Apotheosis of
    George Washington" by Barralet (see lot 59), making only two substantial
    changes: replacing Washington's head with Lincoln's, and changing the
    inscription on the tomb. Faith, Hope, and Charity welcome him into heaven.
    Other details might properly have been updated, but remained the same. Most
    notably, the shield in the lower left corner bears only the 15 stars of
    Washington's time, rather than the 35 stars of the union which Lincoln had
    worked so hard to restore. The badges of the Society of Cincinnati and the
    Freemasons hanging from the tomb were also far more appropriate for
    Washington than for Lincoln. "Others may have wondered about the mourning
    Indian; a freed black man would have been far more appropriate"--Holzer, et
    al., Lincoln Image, pages 198-203. A beautiful example.

    This piece was printed to accompany a map of the region, "Novissima Tabula
    Regionis Ludovicianae Gallice dictae La Louisiane," not offered here.
    However, it stands alone as a scarce and important promotional piece to
    attract German investment in the French "Company of the Indies,"
    encompassing not only modern Louisiana but also much of the entire
    Mississippi River basin. Settlements, forts, American Indian groups, and
    natural resources are all discussed. Efforts like this brought thousands of
    German immigrants to the area, many of them settling on the "German Coast"
    west of New Orleans. <br><br>Wild speculation in these shares was known as
    the Mississippi Bubble, which soon burst and wiped out the investments of
    many participants, large and small. The architect of the bubble, the
    economist John Law, is mentioned here: "The whole trade of the shares rests
    on the credit of a Scotsman named Law . . . a clever and sharp mind, who
    started the bank in Paris and afterwards got the West Indian Mississippi
    trading company going. He also knew by persuasion and imaginative
    advertising to exalt the enterprise as great and profitable for the people
    so that everybody wanted to share in these profits" (translation taken from
    the Cornell University catalog). After the bubble burst, Law left France in
    disgrace and eked out a living as a gambler, yet his economic theories
    remain influential today. European Americana 720/102; Streeter sale I:116.

    First edition of the scripture of the Mormon church, released just days
    before the official establishment of the church on 6 April 1830. This was
    the only edition listing Joseph Smith as the "author and proprietor" rather
    than as the translator, and the only edition with his 2-page preface. This
    copy has the 2 pages of witness testimony at the end, but not the index
    pages which were inserted in later copies. <br><br>The first edition was
    printed with numerous variants; Crawley concludes that "very few copies of
    the book exist which are entirely identical." This copy includes the
    uncorrected sheets for 6 of the 41 variants noted in Jenson: page 212 is
    numbered "122"; page 393 reads "neither does", page 487 is numbered "48";
    page 514 reads "maybe" instead of "may be"; page 575 reads "elder priest"
    instead of "elder or priest"; and page 576 reads "un-to the baptism." See
    Janet Jenson, "Variations between Copies of the First Edition of the Book of
    Mormon," BYU Studies 13 (Winter 73), 214-222. Crawley 1; Flake 595; Grolier
    Hundred 37; Howes S623; Sabin 83038; Streeter sale IV:2262.
    <br><br>Provenance: an early (but probably not original) owner was Nicholas
    Summerbell (1816-1889), who signed the front flyleaf and title page, and
    also added the date 1858. Summerbell was born in Peekskill, NY, was a
    Protestant clergyman in Cincinnati by 1850, and in 1858 became the founding
    president of Union Christian College in Meron, Indiana. During the Civil War
    he served as chaplain of the 115th Indiana Infantry. He spent his final
    years in the Cincinnati area. The signatures are a good match for the one
    seen on his 1888 passport application, and the notations to the volume
    appear to have been done during a careful reading by a scholar of religion.
    <br><br>This past year, the book was found in Wolfeboro, NH, a popular
    Mormon summer resort town. A resident asked her grandson to remove some
    boxes of rubbish to the trash, and he noticed this book inside. It has since
    been conserved, and a new front board added which might well pass for the
    original.

    When Joseph Smith set out to create a new translation of the Bible in 1830,
    he began with a copy of Phinney's 1828 quarto edition. Changes were written
    in the margins by a series of assistants; the Joseph Smith Translation was
    then published from the annotated Bible in 1867. The original annotated
    Bible is still in the possession of the Community of Christ (RLDS). This
    Phinney Bible is not annotated by Joseph Smith, but it is from the same
    edition. We notice one other unusual quirk in this Bible: a faint diamond
    pattern impressed across the length of each sheet, presumably to flatten the
    leaves as they came off the press. Only one other book comes to mind which
    is often seen with a similar pattern, the 1830 first edition of the Book of

    William Wines Phelps (1792-1872) was a central figure in the early years of
    the Latter-Day Saints. A newspaper publisher in small-town Canandaigua, NY
    in the late 1820s, he purchased a Book of Mormon in April 1830, and soon
    became a leader in the faith's new settlement at Independence, Missouri.
    There, he published the Evening and the Morning Star newspaper and began
    publishing the Book of Commandments until his press was destroyed by a mob
    in July 1833. At that point most of the Missouri members returned to
    Kirtland, OH, but Phelps wrote this letter from Liberty, MO, a few miles
    north of Independence (and now a suburb of Kansas City). <br><br>This letter
    is addressed to Oliver Phelps, a prominent lawyer from his old home town of
    Canandaigua, NY, now living in the nearby state capital of Albany, NY.
    Despite sharing a last name and home town, the two were apparently not close
    relatives. William wrote (in part): <br><br>"I ask of you as a signal
    benefit for myself, as well as the perusal as distinguished partisans of the
    Jackson party in this region, that you will have goodness to forward to me,
    while the session of the New York legislature, one of the semi-weekly papers
    of Albany. . . . I am located about 2,500 miles from you, still I have an
    anxiety to know how the Empire State maintains her dignity amid the crowd of
    nations that exist, and are striving to burst into being. I have an eye to
    the world as it is marshalling itself for some great event and, as ever, I
    feel a warm desire to act well my part, and enjoy the confidence of all,
    both friends and foes." <br><br>This letter makes no direct reference to
    Phelps's religious faith or activities; his conversion had been
    controversial in Canandaigua, and thus probably not a point to bring up when
    asking for a favor. However, his apocalyptic description of the "world as it
    is marshalling itself for some great event" would have no ready explanation
    in the national news at the time (Jackson had been re-elected the previous
    year), and might suggest his frame of mind after having his business
    recently burned by an angry mob. Why he wanted access to New York state
    political news is also a mystery; he may have been curious whether the
    Saints were getting any media coverage. <br><br>We know of no earlier extant
    Phelps letters. Brigham Young University and the Church History Library each
    have substantial William Wines Phelps collections with letters dating as
    early as 1835.

    In 1836, Joseph Smith decided that the Saints required knowledge of Hebrew
    to advance their theological studies. They brought the Hebrew scholar Joshua
    Seixas to Kirtland to give daily lessons to a group of more than thirty,
    including Smith. Seixas had written a Hebrew grammar, and provided Smith
    with a copy of the 1834 second edition for his studies. The lessons
    continued for more than two months, and had some influence on the further
    development of the faith--most notably in the word Nau-Voo, which appears on
    page 50 of the Seixas grammar. See Louis C. Zucker, "Joseph Smith as a
    Student of Hebrew," in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 3 (Summer
    1968), pages 41-55. The grammar offered here is not the one used in
    Kirtland--that remains among Smith's papers in Salt Lake City--but it

    The famed illustrator Winslow Homer (1836-1910) launched his career at age
    19 as an apprentice lithographer for J.H. Bufford in Boston, working mostly
    on sheet music. Much of his work was uncredited, but this illustration has
    the initials "WH" craftily inscribed between the two lower medallion views,
    with a more formal credit going to "J.H. Bufford's Lith." This cover,
    featuring a battle scene, raised flag, eagle, and other patriotic motifs,
    was used for six different patriotic songs arranged by Francis Brown for the
    piano. <br><br>The following year, in 1857, Homer began his long run as a
    freelance illustrator for Harper's Weekly and other publications, but as an
    artist rather than a lithographer. His original credited lithographic works
    are not often seen, and to have this quintessential American artist grace
    the cover of the national anthem is a fortuitous combination. Not in Filby &

    Duke of York, in 1664; the Duke's grant of what became New Jersey to Sir
    George Carteret and Lord Berkeley; Berkeley's sale of his half to a group of
    Quakers led by William Penn in 1674; and the partition of this half as West
    Jersey in 1676. It then describes the sale of a portion of a 7/90th portion
    of West Jersey to the partnership of Thomas Hutchinson, Thomas Pearson,
    Joseph Helmsley, George Hutchinson and Mahlon Stacy. This land extended from
    the Assumpink Creek south to Burlington--the modern city of Trenton and
    points south. <br><br>Finally, this deed grants by "Mahlon Stacy for & in
    consideration of the sum of ffive and twenty pounds on lawful English money
    to him in hand paid by the said Robert Stacy . . . one full equall &
    undevided sixth pt, in six pts to be devided of one of the aforesaid seaven
    nynetieth pts of all that the said westernly pt." Mahlon Stacy (1638-1704),
    a tanner and devout Quaker, became a central figure in the earliest history
    of the Trenton area. His brother Robert Stacy (1631-1701) also remained in
    the area. In August 1677 he became the first magistrate in West Jersey.

    A pair of anonymous poems to rally the insurgents in the Anti-Rent War which
    spread across upstate New York from 1839 to 1845. The Van Rensselaer family
    had exercised feudal dominion over the Manor of Rensselaerswyck surrounding
    Albany, NY throughout the colonial period, and for decades after the
    revolution. After the 1839 death of Stephen Van Rensselaer, his heirs
    attempted to collect back rent from the tenants to cover the estate's debts,
    resulting in a widespread and long-running insurrection, which culminated in
    the 1845 killing of an undersheriff by masked marauders at an eviction sale
    in Delaware County. <br><br>The Anti-Renters consciously evoked the Boston
    Tea Party with their American Indian costumes and imagery, a connection
    drawn clearly in this broadside. The illustration is a crude woodcut showing
    one of their "brave Indian boys" in full regalia. The first poem begins "Ye
    sons of Tuscarora, to arms! to arms! advance /'Tis time to take your guns in
    hand, and make landholders prance / For sixty years our Rents we've paid /
    And not a word against it said / Now it's time a settlement's made / With
    brave Indian boys." "Lyric No. 2" similarly begins "With his mask upon his
    brow, and his rifle in his hand / The Indian marches forth to drive
    oppression from the land." (One suspects that large groups of actual Indians
    with rifles might not be embraced as brothers by these Anti-Renters.) Boston
    and Rhode Island are name-checked to recall the befeathered revolutionaries
    of the Tea Party and the Gaspee Affair. Several references are made to the
    tin horns famously used by guerrillas to communicate across the hills--and
    terrify the sheriff's men. <br><br>Any material from the Anti-Rent War is
    scarce, and (as with any rebellion), material from the insurgent side is
    considerably scarcer. 2 copies in OCLC, and none traced at auction.

    A dramatic rendering of a night-time steamship disaster on the upper part of
    the Hudson River between the towns of Athens and Hudson. The ship is seen in
    flames, with passengers leaping from the wreck which torch-wielding rescuers
    in rowboats seek survivors and two other steamships close in to help with
    the rescue. <br><br>The American Antiquarian Society holds the only known
    institutional example of this print, but bearing the credit line of James
    Baillie as the lithographer and publisher. Nathaniel Currier published a
    very similar lithograph of this scene, basically a mirror image, but this
    version has a few additional details, including flags identifying the rescue
    ships. The Currier version has a similar caption but lists the death toll at
    "nearly 40 lives," while here "nearly 100 lives are supposed to be lost."
    The early press reports placed the death toll at between 30 and 40, since
    revised downward to the mid-twenties. We suspect that one of these rival
    lithographers pirated the other. As Baillie tripled the death toll of the
    newspaper reports, and then apparently removed his name from the stone, we
    suspect this may be the pirated one--but it remains a compelling view.

    In 1874, the naturalist and photographer Seneca Ray Stoddard (1844-1917)
    published the first tourist map of the Adirondack Mountains; he also
    produced numerous guidebooks to the region. In this letter, a young woodsman
    and inventor named John Elford Alden (1862-after 1925) colorfully offers
    Stoddard the wealth of his personal knowledge of the region. He begins with
    his credentials: "I have been on to over 200 lakes and ponds now shown on
    your map, and on to over 500 mountain peaks, and have seen a good many more
    ponds and streams which I did not have time to explore. I have been through
    windslashes, swamps, burnt timber, beaver meadows, heavy timber thickets,
    over ledges, waded creeks . . . carried boats and packs, climb over range
    after range of mountains and crossed numberless brooks . . . also found a
    good many comfortable shanties not on your map." Over the course of 4 pages
    he proceeds to list the various lakes and high peaks on his "life list,"
    describes some of his impressive feats of navigation, and describes the
    location of the "best brook trout fishing I have had the luck to see" (you
    will need to be the winning bidder to get that tidbit). He also describes
    numerous wilderness lakes not on the Stoddard map. In closing he notes:
    "Have also heard wolves howl from my log house at Indian Lake and lost a
    good deal of venison at my camp by bears and been through miles of raspberry
    brush where they were all trampled down with bears near south branch of
    Moose River." It is not clear from this letter what Mr. Alden wants, but he
    offers a remarkable wealth of observation on one of the last great frontiers
    of the East.

    James Horton Taft (1822-1906) wrote this diary as a devout young
    Manhattanite, very active in the Allen Street Methodist Episcopal Church and
    missionary activities. At least 90% of the content relates to Bible
    readings, church services, missionary society meetings, Sunday school,
    church social events, and spiritual discussions. An effort to have an
    African boy named in his honor for a $30 sponsorship is discussed on 1
    September and 28 October 1845, and 26 March 1846. <br><br>Horton rarely
    discussed his work as a drug merchant, although a business trip to
    Philadelphia on 6-12 January 1846 is recounted at length, including visits
    to factories for linseed oil and quinine, as well as some tourist
    excursions. A visit to extended family in Warren, RI is described from 2 to
    6 July 1846. He also made an enigmatic reference to a manuscript about the
    famed whale ship Essex, an inspiration for Moby Dick: "Spent the evening at
    Ms. Fuller's. . . . Read there the account of the loss of the whaling ship
    Essex, which vessel was struck & stove by a whale. The account was written
    by Capt. C.R. Griffith, who obtained it from one of his crew on board of the
    ship Southport, who was on board the Essex at the time of her loss." (6
    October 1845). We can find no other reference to this account of the Essex,
    which Horton described as a manuscript in the next day's entry.
    <br><br>Although Horton was a young man, and baseball was being born as an
    organized sport in the New York area in 1845 and 1846, we find no mention of
    the New York Knickerbockers or their games in Brooklyn and Hoboken. He did
    visit Elysian Fields in Hoboken on 12 October 1846, 4 months after the
    famous inaugural game. Horton did indulge in a classic 1840s New York treat
    on occasion, though: "Ate some stewed oysters, walked down the Bowery a
    short distance, saw a political procession of the Young Democracy & then
    returned home." (31 October 1845). The diary concludes with a short entry on
    Horton's marriage, to the daughter of the minister of his church.

    John Toan Mills (1821-1910) ran the Bull's Head stagecoach line along Third
    Avenue up to 42nd Street in Manhattan, which was being driven out of
    business by a horse-drawn rail line along the same route. Starting in 1859,
    Mills began petitioning to be allowed to run his own horse-drawn cars along
    a portion of the same rails, on the principle that the rails were a public
    utility. This was granted in December 1863, which brought him into conflict
    with the Third Avenue Railroad Company, a fast-growing company in the
    process of becoming the dominant streetcar operator in the city. This
    battle, which had a David vs. Goliath tone, continued in one form or another
    though at least 1886. Offered here are the files kept by Mills relating to
    this fight: correspondence, petitions, drafts of legislation, resolutions.
    Mills wrote constantly to governors, mayors, and state legislators in an
    effort to get formal support for his claim. One side battle was over
    construction costs due to his son-in-law John L. Brown; another was a battle
    with one Henry Hart, who had apparently welched on an offer to buy out the
    stage line. <br><br>One interesting file contains 11 long petitions circa
    1861 filled with names and addresses of "property owners and residents,"
    urging the state legis;lature to grant Mills rail access, "as a relief
    against the inconvenience and suffering we have been obliged to submit to
    for a number of years, by riding in crammed, over-crowded and ill-ventilated
    cars." Another file contains printed handbills, court cases, and legislative
    speeches on the case; other files include many manuscript drafts of
    legislation. Mills was continually writing and re-writing the history of the
    case. One result is a heavily annotated manuscript draft timeline history of
    the railway by Mills, starting in 1830 ("Since 1830 stage lines existed on
    3rd Ave & the Bowery & Chatham St. The first established was known as the
    Bulls Head Line"), and continues over 6 closely written pages through 1868,
    plus 4 pages of appended documents. Similarly, slips of paper contain
    extracts from his diary dated 1866 to 1872. His correspondence file includes
    retained drafts of letters to Governor Fenton, Mayor A. Oakey Hall, state
    senator Charles Folger (later Secretary of Treasury), and many others. Most
    of the papers relate to the Third Avenue Railway case, but also included are
    a file on construction work done for the Croton Aqueduct in 1868; and a
    battered but heavily annotated album of cartes-de-visite--family, friends,
    and Ulysses S. Grant. This archive is more than just a legal case--it is a

    Oliver Hazard Perry (1817-1864) of Cleveland, OH was not a close relative of
    the War of 1812 naval hero of the same name, but was certainly named in his
    honor. He kept detailed diaries of his hunting trips for deer and elk in the
    woods of Ohio and Michigan from 1836 to 1855. <br><br>Perry died in a
    railroad accident in 1864, and this finely printed volume was produced as a
    tribute "for distribution among his personal friends" 35 years later. It is
    illustrated throughout with tailpieces printed from original circa 1800
    woodblocks by Alexander Anderson and others. The bookplate of distinguished
    collector Paul Lemperly (1858-1939) of Cleveland graces the front pastedown.
    Lemperly was too young to have been among Perry's friends, but he was
    certainly known to the proprietors of Marion Press, who produced this
    volume--they had printed his study of bookplates earlier that year. See "A
    List of Books Printed at the Marion Press," 38 and 41. Both the book's
    editor Charles W. Bingham and Lemperly were active in the Rowfant Club,
    Cleveland's bibliophilic society, which would have been the natural
    constituency for this production. Graff 3258; Howes P250 ("b"); Streeter

    This volume was kept by James Bingham (1694-1737), a saddler of
    Philadelphia, and his heirs. His son William Sr. (1725-1769) was also a
    saddler, but grandson William Bingham Jr. (1752-1804) made some fortuitous
    investments and married into the wealthy Willing family, and became perhaps
    the most prosperous man in Philadelphia by the time of his death, also
    serving a term in the United States Senate. <br><br>Hundreds of receipts
    issued to Bingham (signed by other early Philadelphia residents) show the
    evolution of James Bingham's business, with several saddles and related
    works described in the early entries, such as "eight hunting sadles" sold in
    November 1719 and a "sidsadle" on 25 July 1722. He made increasing land
    investments, and in June 1731 dabbled in mercantile shipping investments,
    sending a marble table to Jamaica "for as much as it will fech", and then
    investing in rum from Barbados. He continued with his original trade,
    though, with purchases of large quantity of leather in September 1733. The
    famed Philadelphia mapmaker Nicholas Scull signed a receipt on 11 August
    1737 for "suroveghing 2000 acres land & . . . 500 acres at Cohogan,
    Lanchester County and for 279 bushells lime." <br><br>In addition to the
    receipts are several pages of other accounts and memoranda. The first full
    page includes a long "memorandum of outlay on ye boatt" including tar,
    timber, oakum, nails, oars and more. On the second page is a recipe for rum
    punch. A few of the receipts were issued to James's widow Anne through 1747,
    and one to son William in 1765. A short memorandum reads "Miss Benezet
    accepts with pleasure Miss B & Mr. Cadwal"; it was perhaps written by
    William's granddaughter Maria Benezet (1778-1799).

    Robert Patterson (1773-1854) wrote this letter at Jean Bonnet's Tavern in
    Bedford, PA, noted as a hotbed of Whiskey Rebellion sentiment and still in
    operation as an historic tavern. He was travelling southeast through
    Pennsylvania during the Whiskey Rebellion, just as the militia called up by
    President Washington was headed west to suppress the rebels. He wrote:
    "Early in the morning we met about seven hundred of the army between the
    foot of the Alegany and the Dry-Ridge. Near their front was Govnr. Mifflin.
    These we passed without any inconvenience except here and there a question
    from the soldiers: Are you Whiskey boys? Are you making your escape &c. Then
    along the Dry-Ridge we met detached parties of light horse, droves, forage
    and baggage waggons &c &c so frequently that we were rarely out of sight of
    one company till another was in view. Thus we traveled for about five miles
    and then we began to meet the thick marching corps of foot and light horse
    who marched in as close succession as they could, and were in general from
    five to seven men deep. . . . Among others we were a while with Alexr.
    Hamilton, Secretary." <br><br>Patterson was ordered to backtrack eight miles
    to be interviewed by a judge: "I found it a great benefit to me that I had
    not been actually engaged in any of the riotous marches. I told nothing but
    the truth and very little of that, and I believe all in such a manner as it
    would not in the least injure any of my friends." <br><br>The massive
    military display made Patterson fearful for his nation's liberties: "My
    heart inwardly throbed when I viewed the sad condition our poor country must
    shortly be in because of a few rash illegal measures that had been taken by
    some of our countrymen." He noted that the troops "breath out dreadful
    threats and vengeance against all who have had an active part in the riots,
    but especially against the liberty poles and their votaries." <br><br>The
    author was the son-in-law of John Canon (1741-1798), the prominent founder
    of Canonsburg, near Pittsburgh--known as another seat of rebellion. He was
    writing to John's eldest son William (1774-1858). Why he chose to sign as
    "P.R." is unknown, but he was obviously nervous about running afoul of the
    army; the letter is docketed as from "R Paterson Jr." He attended the
    University of Pennsylvania, and later became a clergyman and publisher in
    Pittsburgh. Provenance: Sotheby's sale, 22 June 1981, lot 293, to Milton R.

    John Francis "Frank" Gaitree, who was a steamboat clerk and captain based
    out of Pittsburgh, PA. His 4 letters in this lot are dated 1853-58. Most
    notably, on 10 April 1854 he wrote: "I am at presant building a boat which
    employs most of my time. I am building the largest steam wheel boat that
    ever was built here. When finished she will cost me about twenty-one
    thousand dollars. I own one fourth." This may have been the steamer Paul
    Jones, a very large 353-ton vessel launched out of Pittsburgh on New Year's
    Day, 1855. The Pittsburg Daily Post of 1 December 1854 mentions Gaitree as
    the new ship's clerk. The Paul Jones was most famous as the ship on which
    young Samuel Langhorne Clemens (Mark Twain) began his practical studies as a
    river pilot in 1857. <br><br>The remaining letters are written by 3 of
    Gaitree's half-brothers. Eldest half-brother John Paul Grimball (1826-1866)
    was somehow separated from his mother at birth and raised in rural Avoyelles
    Parish, Louisiana. His 1850 letter begins poignantly: "It would be
    impossible were I to undertake to describe to you my feelings on receiving
    intelligence that my dear mother was yet alive, and that I had four brothers
    & a kind sister liveing whom I knew not & who I suppose never knew they had
    such a brother living." <br><br>Another half-brother, Joseph N. Miraben
    (1837-1863), was also involved in the steamboat trade. He wrote from
    Louisiana in 1860: "I want [brother John Gaitree] to take my place for a
    while, so that I can rusticate. He made a trip up on the boat, or he would
    have been here 10 days ago. The Pine Bluff left New Orleans last Saturday
    for Arkansas River. I think she is doing a good business as the papers speak
    very highly of her." The New Orleans Times-Picayune of 19 Jan 1860 notes the
    steamer Pine Bluff leaving for the Arkansas River with John F. Gaitree,
    clerk. <br><br>The youngest brother Leonidas Romulus Miraben (1839-1892)
    wrote one final letter while serving in the Civil War as a sergeant in
    Battery C of the West Virginia Light Artillery, 23 September 1863: "We are
    now camped near the Culpepper C.H., it being only about five miles from here
    to the front, it being on the Rapidan. I think from present appearances we
    will move forward soon, as I think the rebels have or are going to evacuate
    Virginia, with the exception of holding Richmond." More detailed
    descriptions of these letters are available upon request.

    This album represents two important milestones: the end of Mathew Brady's
    career as the most renowned American photographer of the 19th century, and
    the birth of what became the Organization of American States. <br><br>The
    American politician James Blaine (1830-1893), best known as the losing
    candidate in the 1884 presidential election, served as Secretary of State
    from 1889 to 1892. Blaine had an expansive vision of the nation's role on
    the international stage, and convening the First International Conference of
    American States was one of his first accomplishments as the nation's top
    diplomat. Held from 20 January to 27 April 1890, it brought together 27
    delegates from 17 nations. A secretariat was established on 14 April which
    evolved into today's Organization of American States. The date is still
    observed as Pan-American Day. <br><br>The work of photographing the
    delegates was given to Mathew B. Brady (1822-1896), revered for his
    pioneering work from 1844 through the Civil War. By 1890, he had gone
    through bankruptcy and was in poor health, just six years away from an
    ignominious death in a hospital charity ward. His most recent major
    commission had been an 1888 album of the members of the 50th Congress. He
    was later hired to produce a similar album of the 1891 Patent Centennial,
    but no examples are known. <br><br>Among the most well-known delegates
    represented here are Blaine, who leads off the album as portrait 1; wagon
    manufacturer Clement Studebaker, #22, and industrialist Andrew Carnegie,
    #25. Among the Latin-American delegates were two future presidents of
    Argentina, Manuel Quintana and Roque Sáenz Peña; and a former president of
    Ecuador, José María Plácido Caamaño. Philippe Hannibal Price of Haiti
    appears second in the volume. Delegates from Peru, Guatemala, Colombia,
    Uruguay, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Brazil, Honduras, Mexico, Bolivia, Venezuela,
    Chile, and El Salvador are also represented. The final image shows the
    Wallach Mansion on Massachusetts Avenue, where the conference was held.

    Three Bonine brothers had substantial careers as photographers. Robert
    Atkinson Bonine (1836-1912) was a photographer in Altoona, PA for many
    years. The best known, Elias Atkinson Bonine (1843-1916) went to California
    in 1876, and is renowned for his Indian photographs taken on expeditions to
    Arizona through the 1880s. Archibald Franklin Bonine (1846-1907) was a
    photographer in Lancaster, PA from at least 1884-1892. <br><br>Offered here
    are a large group of photographs by and of the Bonine family, apparently
    from the family of niece Flora Jane Sener Weiand (1869-1955). They include:
    <br><br>20 promenade cards of Pasadena, CA views on matching mounts by Elias
    Atkinson Bonine, each personally inscribed on verso with notes such as "Snow
    on the mountains, from my windmill" and "My apricot orchard," plus another
    on similar mount of a cactus-strewn farm scene in Arizona (uncaptioned).
    <br><br>Set of 3 portraits on Elias Atkinson Bonine mounts, possibly
    self-portraits; one is marked "Sacramento Ranch--uncle & prospector."

    In 1812, Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry pushed through a
    redistricting plan to create safe seats for his Democratic-Republican Party.
    The injustice of this complex maneuver was difficult to convey to rank and
    file members of the rival Federalist Party, so a graphic was in order. This
    front-page newspaper map was the first attempt. It shows the new lines drawn
    across two Massachusetts counties, Worcester and Essex. The accompanying
    text describes one of the new Essex districts as being "properly called by
    the name which children give to a letter in the alphabet, Crooked S." A long
    remonstrance against this redistricting fills much of pages 1 and 2, and two
    long editorials on page 3 continue the case, railing against "the crooked
    district in Essex." <br><br>Three days later, another Federalist paper, the
    Boston Gazette, issued their own version of this map as a broadside. Then,
    on 26 March, they hit on a stroke of genius, engraving the S-shaped Essex
    district as a horrible winged and clawed creature dubbed the Gerrymander.
    This was the winning combination to get the message across--and the term
    remains in common use among political commentators today. <br><br>The Weekly
    Messenger was issued in two editions, the city edition and this somewhat
    scarcer "Weekly Messenger for the Country" (as described at the end of the
    final page). We trace neither at auction, though Goodspeed offered one in
    1929.

    An unusual betting document compiled shortly before the 1840 presidential
    election. 27 bets are recorded, by 14 different men, all against one
    Alexander Donnan. Several of the bettors have been traced to Petersburg, VA,
    most notably the wonderfully named Armistead V. Prosise. Young University of
    Virginia graduate Alexander Donnan (1818-1892) had just begun practicing law
    in Petersburg in 1840. The bets are large for 1840, ranging from $1 to $30,
    but most were paid in articles of clothing: a coat, a vest, a hat, a pair of
    pantaloons. In all cases, Donnan seems to have supported the Whig Harrison,
    and his friends were all believers in Van Buren's doomed re-election
    campaign. Not all of the bets were for a straight Van Buren victory; some
    were on specific margins of votes or for specific states. The final
    accounting is convoluted, but we feel confident that Mr. Donnan went about
    well-clothed for the entirety of the William Henry Harrison presidency.

    The National Convention of Union Soldiers and Sailors was a Civil War
    veterans association which was formed in 1866 to support the Democratic
    Party, as a counter-balance to the Republican-leaning Grand Army of the
    Republic. The 1868 convention described here was held in conjunction with
    the Democratic Party convention being held in New York at the same time.
    These minutes were apparently compiled for publication a few weeks after the

    newspapers, and these are clipped and pasted in rather than transcribed. The
    keynote address by Major General Thomas Ewing is inserted in printed

    A speech given in the weeks before the racially charged 1868 election, in
    which Reconstruction stood on trial. This unidentified Democratic speaker in
    Trumbull County, eastern Ohio, was not a fan of Reconstruction: "Grant in
    his letter of acceptance says 'Let us have peace!' What intelligent mind can
    expect peace in a country where intelligence is disenfranchised and
    ignorant, idle and semi-barbarous Negroes have the governing power?
    Radicalism desires peace on those terms. It is the object of all their
    machinations to settle a peace upon the country with white men as slaves and
    serfs. . . . I understand that Mr. Garfield stated in a speech delivered in
    Warren on last Saturday night that the election of Seymour & Blair would
    bring war. We say let it come--the sooner the better. When it does come it
    will not be on the broad savannahs of the south, but in the hills of New
    England" (14-15). Republican congressman (and future president) James A.
    Garfield addressed a massive Trumbull County Republican convention on
    Saturday 10 October 1868 in Warren, OH. This speech apparently shares a

    Much expanded second edition of the regulations for the famed railroad line
    which was founded in 1861 and stretched eastward to complete the
    Transcontinental Railroad at Promontory Point, Utah in 1869. Chapters are
    devoted to the six departments of the railroad, including various auditors,
    freight agents, passenger and ticket agents, and baggage agents. One
    ethnicity is singled out for special treatment: "When [overland] tickets are
    sold to Chinese passengers the word 'Chinaman' must be written thereon, and
    the signature of the passenger also taken. . . . Conductors in charge of
    trains carrying large bodies of Chinamen on special tickets must count the
    number of same en-route" (pages 145, 154). Lunatics and convicts are
    similarly handled on page 154. Certain cargoes were heavily regulated, such
    as transport of salmon in August, or intoxicating liquors bound for Iowa
    (page 101); corpses were also subject to strict rules (page 98, etc.).
    <br><br>This was the personal copy of the Central Pacific's civil engineer
    Lewis Metzler Clement (1837-1914), who had played a central role in bringing
    the transcontinental line to life with bridges and tunnels across the Sierra
    Nevadas. 2 copies traced in OCLC, and none at auction.

    As the Reconstruction period drew to a close, former Confederates grew
    increasingly anxious to regain control of their state and local governments.
    The 1876 election was marked by a variety of clashes between Southern
    Democrats and formerly enslaved people. Although the first incarnation of
    the Ku Klux Klan had been largely broken up by federal troops, they were
    replaced by informal "rifle clubs" which intimidated their opponents, and
    killed dozens. The unrest brought federal troops from the Department of the
    South under the command of General Thomas Ruger. Two separate state
    governments declared themselves the winners; furthermore, the tight
    presidential election depended upon South Carolina's votes as well. The
    disputed governorship lasted for months. This archive documents General
    Ruger's efforts to maintain order in the days and weeks after the election.
    Offered here are 8 documents from General Ruger's files on the election's
    aftermath. They include:<br><br>Contemporary copy of a letter from General
    William T. Sherman to General Winfield Scott Hancock. "Please instruct the
    commanding general at Columbia, S.C. [Ruger] to hold his troops ready, to
    consult with and protect the Board of Canvassers in their duty of counting
    the votes." Washington, 13 November 1876. <br><br>Daniel H. Chamberlain.
    Autograph Letter Signed as South Carolina's sitting Republican governor to
    Ruger. "I am fully persuaded that it is necessary to have a guard of U.S.
    soldiers around my house tonight. . . . There is danger of some attempt at
    violence tonight, and no protection can be so efficient as a small number of
    U.S. troops. I dislike greatly to ask this, but I feel there is a necessity
    for it." Ruger's hastily penciled affirmative response is on verso.
    Columbia, SC, 28 November 1876. <br><br>Official retained copy of a telegram
    from Ruger to General Sherman, seeking guidance on how to manage the chaos.
    "The Governor calls on me to eject certain persons claiming to be entitled
    to places . . . as Democrats. Both parties are now in the Assembly room. In
    the absence of any riot or violence I have not at once acted. . . . I
    request . . . that this be brought to the attention of the Secretary of War
    and President as soon as possible." Columbia, SC, 30 November 1876.
    <br><br>Telegram from General Sherman to Ruger, in response to the above.
    "Both your dispatches of today were placed by me in the hands of the
    Secretary of War, who has gone to the President with the Attorney General
    for consultation." Columbia, SC, 30 November 1876. <br><br>Official
    transcript of a telegram from James Donald Cameron as Secretary of War to
    Ruger, essentially telling him to continue sorting out the electoral crisis
    himself. "Telegram received, shown to the President and your action so far
    approved. If any change in your course is deemed advisable, will instruct
    you from here. Keep us fully advised." Washington, 1 December 1876.
    <br><br>Official transcript of Ruger's telegram to President Grant. "Much
    excitement for few days and large number of men in place, some attending
    State Fair, but most came on account of political situation. Greater part
    have gone. No doubt members of rifle clubs came, but did not appear on
    street as organizations or armed. Have learned that arms were brought into
    city. No open demonstration has been made against state authorities.
    Threatening talk by individuals on street and about hotels." Columbia, SC, 7
    December 1876. <br><br>Manuscript list of queries presented to Ruger by F.A.
    Connor, chair of a committee of the Democratic state legislators. "You are
    aware that troops are in the state house. Will you be kind enough to inform
    us by whose authority these troops are in the state house, and for what
    purpose they are there? . . . Are your troops instructed to resist the
    peaceable entrance of our House into the hall?" Docketed on verso with a
    note by Connor: "Gen. Ruger, commanding troops in Columbia, will call for
    your reply at 1 o'clock." Ruger has hastily docketed the sheet "Handed me by
    Mr Connor and others on Dec 7th 1876." <br><br>Governor Daniel H.
    Chamberlain. Autograph Letter Signed to Ruger. "I fully concur in your
    judgment respecting the proper action to be taken in regard to affairs at
    Timmonsville. If the danger shall be found to be past, I shall be glad to
    have the necesity of sending troops avoided." This apparently related to the
    assassination of a Black Republican judge in Timmonsville the previous week,
    resulting in threats of retaliation. Columbia, SC, 4 February 1877.

    The 1876 election in South Carolina was marked by widespread violence and
    voter intimidation by white supremacist "rifle clubs" and resulted in two
    governors claiming victory: the incumbent Republican Daniel Chamberlain,
    backed by the federal government and its military, and Democrat Wade Hampton
    III, an ex-Confederate Lieutenant General. The contested presidential
    election was decided in favor of Republicans, but with a compromise
    agreement to withdraw federal troops from the South. When the troops left,
    Governor Chamberlain left, and General Hampton was free to start planning
    his inauguration. This invitation lists the dozens of managers on his

    This document shows almost eight years of barter accounts between two of
    Rhode Island's most prominent figures from the American Revolution. James
    Mitchell Varnum (1748-1789) graduated from what became Brown University,
    practiced law in East Greenwich, RI, and then served as a general in the
    Continental Army during the Revolution. He was noted for enlisting enslaved
    people into the First Rhode Island Regiment in exchange for their freedom,
    and for his service at the Battle of Rhode Island and Valley Forge. William
    Greene Jr. (1731-1809) of Warwick, RI served as governor of Rhode Island
    from 1778 to 1786, a period including the long British occupation of
    Newport, the American victory, and Rhode Island's act for the gradual
    emancipation of the enslaved. <br><br>On the left side of this document are
    debts incurred by Varnum to Greene, and on the right the services rendered
    by Varnum to repay the debts. The earliest entry was in June 1780, just
    after Varnum's election to the Continental Congress, when Governor Greene
    sent "six barrels racked sider delivered you in Providence." Perhaps Varnum
    shared some of this cider with the French General Rochambeau, whose troops
    came to Providence for an extended stay the following month. <br><br>From
    1783 to 1788, Greene provided Varnum with a steady supply of farm goods and
    services from his substantial Warwick estate: keeping his horse and oxen,
    and sending butter, wood, corn, onions, and hay. Typically for the period,
    these men of means trusted that the debt would be settled at some point,
    either by cash, goods, or services. Varnum's opportunity to reciprocate came
    in November 1784. The governor's son Ray Greene had just graduated from
    Yale, and was interested in pursuing a law career. Varnum agreed to tutor
    the youth for two years for £30, a solid investment--Ray Greene later became
    a United States Senator. Varnum also rented Greene some office space for 12
    weeks, returned some old cider barrels, and settled the nearly decade-long
    account with a mere 4½ pence. Both men signed at the bottom on 13 March
    1788, signifying that the account was officially balanced. General Varnum
    moved to the western frontier as an early Ohio settler soon afterward, where
    he died of tuberculosis within a year. This account documents the
    longstanding relationship between two figures of great significance to the
    state's history.

    This receipt book was kept by Elizabeth Frazier, widow of Hugh Frazier,
    starting in 1793. Many of the receipts are for quarterly rent she paid on a
    boarding house she kept on Charleston's picturesque Stoll's Alley. She also
    paid for schooling for her sons Phil, Alexander William ("Sandy"), George,
    and James. In 1799 , she began monthly payments for the hired labor of
    enslaved people. The first of these entries reads "received 30th December
    1799 of Mrs. Eliza Frazer six dollars in full up to this date for the hire
    of my wench Sue one month. Mary Fowke." In May 1801, she became Mrs. Matthew
    Miner, continuing with monthly payments for "negro hire" and moving their
    residence to nearby 21 East Bay Street. <br><br>The entries become more
    sparse after 1804, but reflect moves to Newport, RI, and French Grant and
    Marietta, OH, where Elizabeth died in 1815. A few later memorandum entries

    In 1887, the Glens Falls Breeders Association began harness racing on a
    half-mile track in Glens Falls, NY. The Northern New York Trotting Horse
    Breeders Association was formed in 1889 and took over the operation. A new
    full mile track was opened in 1893. For several years it was very prominent
    on the national racing Grand Circuit. A speed record was set there on 10
    September 1896 between the horses John R. Gentry and Star Pointer. <br>This
    lot includes some or all of the N.N.Y.T.H.B.A.'s race records for each year
    of its existence from 1889 through October 1902, as recorded in pre-printed

    Books," manuscript copies of the official judge's books, transcribed at
    year's end for each of the association's members. John R. Gentry's
    record-setting 2:01½-minute performance, national news for racing fans at
    the time, is recorded on page 24 of the 1896 volume. Not included is the
    association's aborted 1903 season, which was postponed until 20 July. The
    track was sold at a foreclosure sale two days later, bringing its racing to

    Christy's Minstrels were founded in 1843, and soon became the nation's
    leading blackface minstrel performers, helping to define the standard form
    of a minstrel show. This program is from early in their 7-year residency at
    Mechanics' Hall in New York, which began in March 1847. This program
    contains an unusual footnote: "Gentlemen are requested not to beat time with
    their feet, as it is annoying to the audience generally, and confuses the
    Performers." Founder Edwin Christy and his stepson George disbanded the
    group by 1855, although other performers toured on the Christy's name for
    many years after.

    Jackson Edwin Guernsey (1910-1998) was raised in Shavertown, PA and
    graduated from Williams College in 1931, embarking on a career as a science
    teacher. On his summer breaks in 1933 and 1935, he undertook impressive
    cross-country trips, both documented here with photographs and meticulously
    presented itineraries. In the first, he took a bus from Pennsylvania to
    Portland, OR, bicycled across to eastern Montana, took another bus to
    Chicago, and bicycled home. The photographs show the Grand Canyon, redwoods,
    Crater Lake, Yellowstone Park, and the Century of Progress World's Fair in
    Chicago--95 snapshots in all. His 1935 trip took him southward through
    Kentucky (Mammoth Cave is represented), Alabama, and into Florida, circling
    around Lake Okeechobee before skirting along the coast to Charleston, SC and
    cutting inland via Virginia's Natural Bridge toward home--52 snapshots.
    Interspersed between and after the bicycle trips are shots of his work at
    the Wilkes-Barre Academy, including sporting events and a massive flood in
    March 1936, as well as a few family snapshots (81 non-bicycling shots in

    A gruesome battlefield scene, with one Indian scalping a dead American
    soldier while another takes payment from a British officer with "Secret
    Service money" as a "reward for 16 scalps." In the background, two Indians
    and two red-coated British soldiers dance around a fire. The inspiration is
    thought to be the 15 August 1812 Battle of Fort Dearborn near Chicago, where
    British Colonel Henry Proctor was rumored to have paid for American scalps,
    resulting in the death of some soldiers and civilians who had surrendered.

    William Sydney Porter (1862-1910), best known to posterity as the author O.
    Henry, was raised in North Carolina, and went west to Texas as a young man
    in 1882. After a stint on a sheep ranch, he settled in Austin, TX, where he
    worked various odd jobs while exploring his interest in writing and drawing.
    The drawings offered here were his first professional commission, when he
    was about 21 years old. <br><br>The drawings were done to illustrate the
    frontier mining memoir of Joseph T. Dixon (circa 1844-1929), an eccentric
    character almost universally known as "Uncle Joe." Dixon had spent several
    years prospecting in the Rocky Mountains, and was brought to Austin, TX by a
    friend named John Maddox to set his colorful memories to paper, to be titled
    "Carbonate Days." Young Porter was brought on to illustrate the project,
    working directly with Dixon for about three weeks while they shared a small
    cabin on Maddox's property. After Dixon spent about six months writing at
    Maddox's home, arrangements were made to send him to New York to secure a
    publishing deal. The night before his departure, in a fit of insecurity,
    Dixon tore the manuscript into small pieces and threw it into the creek.
    Fortunately, Porter's illustrations had been given to Maddox for
    safe-keeping. <br><br>The illustrations are almost all captioned in
    manuscript, and appear well-suited for a lively Wild West narrative, filled
    with adventure and comic overtones. A man being startled awake by a room
    full of mules is titled "Early Visitors." Several show street scenes in
    rough-edged mining towns, and two show attempts to buck a burro, while one
    recalcitrant mule is captioned "Don't wish to go prospecting." A young woman
    is captioned "the Señorita of the Cañada." A claim jumper with a gun to his
    head is titled "The jumper taken by surprise." Several of the captions
    suggest specific locations, all in New Mexico: "Cañon Pino"; the head of the
    Pecos River; Herlow's Hotel in Santa Fe; the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
    Railway at Apache Cañon; the head of the Rio Grande; and a Santa Fe street
    scene. Dixon's later biographical accounts note time in Colorado or "the
    Rockies" generally. A 1917 profile called him a former "miner and prospector
    in the Rockies from British Columbia to the Mexican Sierras" who
    participated in the Leadville, CO gold rush. These drawings only hint at the
    stories Dixon told the young Porter in 1884. <br><br>With the destruction of
    the manuscript, the drawings now had no practical purpose, but they were not
    immediately discarded. Porter gave them to a local girl named Pauline
    Haynie, who kept them as a memento. Porter did not adopt the pseudonym O.
    Henry until 1899 and did not achieve success as an author until 1902, with
    his early efforts as an illustrator by that point in the far distant
    rear-view mirror. <br><br>These drawings surfaced in 1912 when 3 items were
    published in "Rolling Stones," the twelfth and final volume of O. Henry's
    collected works. The "Emigrants' Camp" drawing is reproduced facing page 29,
    "Early Visitors" (published as "Morning Visitors") facing page 49, and "Zeke
    Sells the Basket of Toads to the Bloated Bondholder (Herlow's Hotel)" facing
    page 249. So far as we know, the remainder remain unpublished. <br><br>The
    drawings are accompanied by two photographs: a small worn tintype, 2¾ x 2
    inches, of two men said to be young Porter with his friend Wilcox circa 1884
    or 1885; and a well-preserved cabinet card portrait of Porter, 6½ x 4 inches
    including mount, with the backmark of Hamilton Briscoe Hillyer of 916
    Congress Avenue, Austin, TX. Hillyer was at this address from about 1881 to
    1887. Also included are 4 letters and related clippings of later owner John
    Hagelstein, 1925-39. <br><br>References: Arthur Page, "Little Pictures of O.

    their related Walnut Grove Water Storage Company. The water was used for
    placer mining as well as cattle irrigation. The Walnut Grove Dam failed in

    William McKay (1841-1930) was born in Scotland, raised in Canada, and by the
    period of this collection was living in Cherokee, Iowa. Circa 1876 he became
    involved in the Cherokee & San Juan Gold & Silver Mining Company, which
    sought out mining investments in Colorado. A substantial segment of this lot
    relates to his mining activities. A file of 15 contracts and agreements
    covers his claims to specific mines. A file of 36 other mining-related
    documents includes location certificates, assay office reports, and a
    receipt given to McKay in Antelope Park on behalf of "D.T. Hendrick (Bronco
    Dan)". 35 letters are addressed to McKay in Colorado from 1878 to 1880, most
    of them to Animas Forks, then a thriving mine village of several hundred
    souls high in the mountains of San Juan County, but now a completely
    deserted ghost town. Others are addressed to Silver Cliff and other nearby
    camps. <br><br>At least 20 letters were addressed to McKay from Colorado
    while he was back east, 1876-81, many of them with original postmarked
    envelopes. Some of these discuss mining operations, such as C. Allison in
    Animas Forks, 30 August 1876: "I have found the vain of the Custer Lode. . .
    . I think it will prove to be a good one. It is about 20 feet wide and think
    it will show gray copper from the beginning." Robert Skinner's letter of 26
    December 1880 describes the rapid development of Durango, CO in detail.
    Ephemera includes a pair of Denver & Rio Grande railroad maps, a price
    schedule for the Ocean Wave Mining & Smelting Company, a circular letter to
    the stockholders to the Little Dora Gold & Silver Mining Company, and
    McKay's business card as a mining broker. The most visually appealing is a
    color-coded manuscript map of the related claims he handled, centered in
    Animas Forks, 15½ x 19 inches (illustrated). <br><br>The large mass of
    papers outside of McKay's mining activities are also interesting. Much of
    the correspondence was addressed to him while in Cherokee, Iowa, often
    relating to work he did as an agent for the Milburn Wagon Company of Toledo,
    OH, Warrior Mower Company of Little Falls NY, and Aetna Insurance Company,
    and as a general land agent and Justice of the Peace. At least 33 letters
    dated 1873-74 are addressed to McKay as secretary of the St. Andrews
    Society, a chapter of the Scottish-American club hoping to promote
    settlement in the west. McKay had apparently taken an advertisement in the
    Scotch-American Magazine and received responses from all over the nation.
    <br><br>A 11 January 1874 letter from a friend in Ann Arbor, MI describes a
    speech by free love advocate and former presidential candidate Victoria
    Woodhull "or rather attempt to lecture. She had a very fine lecture, but the
    students (about 1000) made such an eternal noise, hooting, hissing and
    groaning that she left the stage in disgust. It approached near to riot." We
    have not read more than a tiny proportion of the correspondence; good
    material undoubtedly remains to be discovered.

    The September 1879 Meeker Massacre in northwestern Colorado was one of the
    more dramatic incidents of the Indian Wars. A Ute uprising on the White
    River Reservation killed Indian agent Nathan Meeker and 10 others. A cavalry
    detachment led by Major Thomas T. Thornburgh rushed out from nearby Fort
    Fred Steele to protect Meeker. They were simultaneously ambushed at Milk
    Creek, with Thornburgh and 13 of his men quickly killed, and the survivors
    holding out for 6 days by crouching behind their dead horses for defense.
    <br><br>Offered here is the letter that got Major Thornburgh into this
    terrible mess. He had been serving uneventfully as a paymaster in Texas
    until swapping positions with Henry Goddard Thomas of the 4th U.S. Cavalry,
    a Union general then serving as major in command of Fort Fred Steele. This
    letter to General Thomas confirms the fateful switch a year before the
    massacre: "Your letter of April 22d on the subject of transfer with Maj.
    Thornberg was received by me. . . . The application had passed through,
    receiving the action of the Lieut. General [Sherman]." <br><br>With--another

    Frank Jay Haynes (1853-1921) was the official photographer for the Northern
    Pacific Railroad and Yellowstone National Park, in addition to his own
    projects. He operated a studio out of a specially outfitted railway car
    which was carried from town to town. One of these photographs has a

    negative at the Montana Historical Society to a ranch near Billings, MT on
    25 October 1885. The other photographs are uncaptioned, but each has been

    An unusual frontier variation on the 19th-century city directory, which
    would normally give street addresses for all residents. In early Montana,
    few of the settlements had proper addresses (or streets), and the territory
    was too vast to make a house-by-house canvass. However, each county's tax
    rolls were available, so they are here transcribed. Each taxpayer's post
    office and often an occupation is given. Once you get to Puller's Springs or
    Silver Bow, finding your party would be a matter of word of mouth. This
    method would not catch most wage laborers, itinerant trappers, or squatters,
    but it does include more than 10,000 names. Frequent occupations include
    miner, saloon owner, assayer, farmer, and stockman. The list also includes
    the occasional Chinese laundryman, such as Ah Min Sing & Quong in Billings
    (page 133). Numerous advertisements, some illustrated, are also included.

    This letter was written from the silver boom town of Chloride, NM, founded
    early in 1881 by a British miner who found silver ore in the canyon, but was
    soon killed by Apaches. The settlement nonetheless quickly grew to more than
    a thousand people. This letter includes lyrical descriptions of the area's
    natural beauty, a few cagey references to his mining prospects, and most
    notably a description of the local Apache fights: <br><br>"I can see the top
    of the San Mateos. These are said to be the most inaccessible mountains in
    the territory. They are the great stronghold of the Apache Indians. Men who
    have been in this range say that one hundred men could not be taken in or
    driven out from this gigantic natural fortress by all the U.S. troops. These
    are the mts from which the Indians last made their incursion on the
    settlements. A large body of men from hereabouts drove them back and
    attempted to follow them into their own country, but were surprised in one
    of the canyons and those who were not killed only escaped under cover of
    night." <br><br>The author also makes interesting observations about miner
    society: "There is a kind of open brotherhood between prospectors. If I make
    a big strike, my neighbor is not envious, but comes over and sees it and
    takes almost as much interest as if it were his own. If I were in the
    mountains and came onto somebody's cabin and was hungry, I should not
    hesitate to go in and take or cook any thing that I could
    find."<br><br>Chloride went into rapid decline after 1893 and is now a
    virtual ghost town on the eastern edge of the Gila National Wilderness.

    The Little Missouri Horse Company was established by Arthur Clark Huidekoper
    in the Dakota Territory in 1884, around the same time and place that
    Theodore Roosevelt began his own ranching adventures. The Little Missouri
    soon became one of the largest horse breeding operations in American
    history, known for its elegant and hard-working Percherons. Various
    addresses are given for the company in southwestern North Dakota, including
    Medora, Amidon, Gladstone, and Black Butte; it was a big property. These
    photographs are captioned in the negative as follows: "River Ranch, Little
    Missouri Horse Co., No. 12"; "Bunch of Percheron Mares, L.M.H. Co. No 24.";

    photographer Truman Ward Ingersoll (1862-1922) was based in St. Paul, MN but
    was known for shooting scenic views throughout the western states. On one

    circa 1886. One of the photographs offered here shows the company's prize

    The author was an artist who went west and found work on a sheep drive to
    Texas. The first letter was written from Saline District in the Cherokee
    portion of Indian Territory, near the present village of Rose, OK, on 13
    April 1859. He describes a fire which destroyed his camp and all of his
    clothing: "It made me angry to think what ragged clothes I had been wearing
    so as to save my good ones, and then lose them by fire." He described his
    present wardrobe as consisting of "a check shirt, jeans pants, and a striped
    jeans hunting shirt made and manufactured by an Indian woman--oh! I look
    quite Indian-like. . . . This is the greatest country for reptiles I ever
    saw. I have killed several rattle-snakes and two centipedes and one
    tarrantilas." He also announces his intention to "lay down my crook and take
    up the old business (Knight of the Brush) as soon as I can reach any place
    where they have a taste for the Fine Arts." <br><br>The second letter was
    written just across the border in Fort Smith, Arkansas, five months later on
    25 September 1859. He describes the town's primitive boarding house lodgings
    at length, adding that he wears a belt "containing a Colt's revolver & an
    extra-sized Arkansaw tooth pick. You may think we are in danger of our
    lives, the way we are supplied with implements of war, but everybody goes
    armed in this country (and that is the cause of so much bloodshed), and a
    person does not know what minute he may be attacked." Two recent murders and
    an attempted murder in town are described.

    This letter was written by attorney Isaac E. West (circa 1838-1900) in
    Yankton, Dakota Territory, concerning the case of the recently arrested
    highwayman Samuel S. "Laughing Sam" Hartman, who had been stirring up
    trouble in and around Deadwood for two years. Legends have Laughing Sam as
    the survivor of a dust-up with Calamity Jane. West wrote: "I received a
    letter from Laughing Sam Saturday asking if I had seen or heard from you,
    that he was anxious to see you &c. What in your opinion ought I to do in
    this matter? I wish to act fairly and honorably by him, but I am really
    unable financially to go to Rapid City and incur the expense of hotel bills
    &c during what may be a tedious trial, with little prospect of remuneration,
    yet I told him I would do so. If he can raise money to pay expenses only, I
    will gladly keep my promise & defend him to the best of my skill & ability."
    Laughing Sam would soon be released on a technicality, but quickly returned
    to jail for a long sentence.<br><br>The letter continues: "Tell Flanner he
    owes me two letters & that I expect him to either discharge the debt or go
    into bankruptcy before they repeal the statute." Alonzo Joseph Flanner
    (1851-1913) had been the first district attorney in Deadwood, and by 1878
    had settled in nearby Crook, SD. <br><br>The most famous sheriff in South
    Dakota was Seth Bullock of Lawrence County, but he only served for a few
    months in 1876 and 1877, and by this point had been replaced by John J.
    Manning. Perhaps more likely as a recipient would be Sheriff Frank P.
    Moulton of Pennington County, based in Rapid City where Laughing Sam was
    being held--35 miles from Deadwood. Regardless of who this letter was
    addressed to, it offers a pungent slice of old Deadwood.

    Seth Bullock (1849-1919) was the first sheriff of Deadwood in 1876, and
    spent the remainder of his life there. This photograph is uncaptioned, but
    was taken by a Deadwood photographer, and Bullock was probably the only man
    in the Black Hills with a nose, ears, and moustache this large. He appears
    in military uniform, dating the scene to shortly after his return from the
    Spanish-American War as an Army captain. A likely date: Deadwood's 25th
    annual Independence Day parade, which featured "the Grand Marshal, Captain
    Seth Bullock, in his uniform as a captain of United States Volunteers;
    mounted Indians from the Pine Ridge Reservation; aides to the grand marshal,
    D.F. Connor, G.P. Mills, and Henry Wyttenbach" (Daily Deadwood Pioneer
    Times, 5 July 1901). <br><br>The stamp on verso reads "C.B. Horton, Jr.,
    Developing, Printing and Viewing, Deadwood St." This would very likely be
    Charles Bela Horton Jr. (1876-1944), then resident in Deadwood as telegraph
    manager, following in his father's footsteps, though we find nothing else
    connecting him to the photography business.

    Sisterdale was a predominantly German settlement in the Texas Hill Country,
    founded in 1847. One of its earliest businesses was a water-cure clinic
    founded by philosopher Ernst Kapp (1808-1896), who had just recently fled
    Germany as a political dissident and became the locus of a community of
    free-thinkers and abolitionists. One of his patients here offers detailed
    commentary on this interesting time and place. He begins with a discussion
    of his health: "I cannot say since the first excitement has fully subsided
    that there is any perceptible improvement in my general health other than an
    increase of strength & cheerfulness. . . . The doctor says that the
    treatment has not yet brought my condition to what he calls a crisis, but
    says with apparent confidence that all my symptoms are favorable & that a
    crisis is near, after which my progress to health shall be both rapid &
    certain. . . . You will have but little time to devote to books if you will
    strictly follow the Doctor's prescriptions. . . . Your outfit must include
    two blankets, four Osnaburgh bedsheets, a few towels & a syringe." One
    disturbance to the peace is "rumours of Indian depredations from abroad &
    even from the immediate neighborhoods of the largest towns." <br><br>Moving
    on to the surprising intellectual ferment of Sisterdale, he explains: "The
    only question of excitement among the Germans here now is slavery, on which
    there is a considerable division among the German population of San Antonio,
    New Braunfels & Fredericksburg. I have attended a party a few weeks ago
    which in selectness, behavior & taste throughout would do credit to the
    aristocracy of Jamestown, Va. I was indeed surprised to perceive the tone &
    cast of the community in this settlement, among which there are men of the
    highest & best calibratted minds. They are now forming a club which is to
    meet once a week for the purpose of aiding each other in learning the
    English language & interchanging sentiments on different & general
    subjects."

    First edition of a colorful classic biography of the Texas frontiersman,
    written by a close lifelong friend. The first 158 pages are devoted to
    hunting and Indian fighting. Pages 159-228 describe his role in the 1842
    Mier Expedition by a Texas militia against Mexico, including his capture,
    survival of the Black Bean episode, and long imprisonment at Perote. The
    final 7 chapters are an uproarious and perhaps not 100% reliable account of

    Henry Harlow Brooks (1871-1936) was a distinguished Manhattan physician and
    professor of clinical medicine at New York University. He had served as a
    civilian physician during the Spanish-American War, and had long been a
    member of the National Guard, so he naturally volunteered for military
    service in 1917 not long after the declaration of war on Germany. <br><br>At
    the heart of this collection are 118 letters written to his wife and
    daughter during his war service. They start with 21 letters written from the
    Long Island training camp at Camp Upton, best known as the subject of the
    Irving Berlin musical "Yip Yip Yaphank." At the end of August 1918, Dr.
    Brooks shipped overseas to France as part of the American Expeditionary
    Force, where he was soon named Chief Consultant in Medicine to the First
    Army, holding the rank of Major. He later took the same title for the Second
    Army under Colonel Charles Ransom Reynolds (1877-1961), later Surgeon
    General. <br><br>Unsurprisingly, the "Spanish Flu" influenza epidemic was a
    frequent subject in his letters. The epidemic was in its most dangerous
    second wave when he arrived in France, and he was hardly a bystander:
    "Pneumonia and influenza are to be my problems, at least I propose what
    should be done, but that is not all in this game by any means, and most of
    all we must keep pounding the Boche [Germans] night and day" (12 October
    1918). He tried to keep his letters upbeat, but his concern came through: "I
    hope you will try very hard not to get tired out or under-nourished, for
    these have been the chief factors in the spread of influenza here. Happily
    we seem to have gotten over the worst of it in our fighting line, which is
    my part of the job, though I am told they are having it further back. Be
    very careful and keep Ruth and mother D. out of crowds" (26 October). He
    reiterated on 26 November after further hard experience: "I am afraid you
    are not keeping yourself warm enough. Sleep, food and warmth keep the
    influenza away. You can not know how I worry about you, so do your very
    best." <br><br>Brooks worked near the front line, but was generally unable
    to offer much combat content due to military censorship. One exception was
    10 November, the day before the Armistice, when he offered a long and
    detailed letter describing his work on the rapid final offensive. "With the
    infantry go the M.O.s [medical officers] establishing their stations as they
    proceed, and leaving non-coms and privates to continue the work as they can,
    and wherever possible to move the wounded back to points which can be
    reached by ambulances, going out also and collecting in a systematic way
    those who cannot come themselves to the dressing stations. . . . I got my
    first real whiff of gas today, got my mask on in jig time and rather enjoyed
    the experience. The next time it may be much worse and I shall be perfectly
    cool and collected." With the fighting over, he was freed to share more
    anecdotes about his experiences. He was eventually promoted to Lieutenant
    Colonel. His correspondence continues through the end of March 1919, when he
    began his journey home. <br><br>Also included are 25 war-date letters Brooks
    received from his wife and daughter; 9 other miscellaneous war-date letters;
    3 photographs of Brooks in uniform; and his military decorations, said to
    have been removed from his uniform by his widow at his funeral.

    Harold Harley Webster (1895-1924) of Lisbon, ND was a musician with the band
    of the North Dakota National Guard, which was activated for World War One as
    the 164th Infantry Regiment. The one time Webster mentions his instrument
    was his favorite Martin "B-flat bass" on 9 June 1918; we infer that he was a
    bass clarinet player. His wartime experience was quite different than the
    soldiers out in the trenches. He was apparently never very close to the
    front, but did his part to boost morale with almost daily concerts at bases
    throughout France for a wide variety of military and civilian audiences.
    <br><br>Before the period of this diary, Webster's guard unit had already
    been activated for duty on the Mexican border, and then was reactivated for
    World War One shortly after their return. This diary begins with his
    departure from a Valley City, ND training camp, followed by two months in
    camps in North Carolina, Long Island, and New Jersey. On 14 December 1917,
    they departed for Europe on a massive captured German transport ship. The
    mood was tense approaching Europe: "No one allowed to undress tonight. Gun
    crews on full force. 12 men to a gun & they have to sleep on deck now,
    beside the gun" (21 December). <br><br>The band was based mostly at two
    camps in France, first in Gondrecourt and later at Langres. However, from
    those bases they travelled far and wide to other military camps, often
    sharing a bill with other performers. On 8 February they shared the stage
    with the noted Shakespearean actor Edward Hugh Sothern. Webster often
    recorded the pieces performed, ranging from patriotic pieces (American,
    English and French), classical music, popular songs, backing for minstrel
    shows, and on several occasions jazz. On 21 October 1918 the band even
    staged a comedy of their own creation: "Over to Turrenne Y and put on our
    show, 'Fun in a Band Room,' a 3 act comedy. It sure went fine. Got a good
    comp[liment] from the Y man." In the rear of the volume is a 3-page list of
    "Our repertoire of big concert numbers," as well as a group photo of the
    band (illustrated) and 4 other photographs. <br><br>The realities of war
    were not far away; funerals and hospital visits were a part of his regular
    routine. Though he noted at Gondrecourt that "we are 25 or 30 miles from the
    trenches" (14 February), the next day he wrote "Woke up at 3 a.m. and sure
    could hear heavy bombardment at the front." He went through gas mask
    training on 20 March 1918. The band was apparently affected during the
    relatively mild first wave of the Spanish Flu from 21 to 27 May: "Gewalt
    went to hosp. with high fever. . . . The band all have the grippe. . . .
    Nothing doing all day for nearly all have the grippe." During the more
    deadly second wave, he mentions it but once, on 27 October 1918: "Nice day,
    but no playing because of the Spanish Flu epidemic." <br><br>Webster and his
    bandmates also found time for the occasional amusement. On 11 March 1918 he
    bummed a joyride with a military pilot for his first airplane ride: "We were
    up in the air over 20 minutes, and at an altitude of over or between 1800 &
    2000 feet." He participated in several baseball games (described at most
    length on 4 May 1918). From 25 July to 3 August he and some friends enjoyed
    a week's leave at the mountain lakeside resort town of Aix-les-Bains, where
    they enjoyed music and café life: "Heard part of band concert by N.H.
    band--sure is a punk band . . . Met a man & his wife (Americans) who took us
    into a cafe at Grand Port & bot us some champagne & Gewalt played some jazz.
    I danced some with the Madame, a young woman & wonderful dancer." He
    concludes this section with an amusing summary with cast of characters in
    yearbook form, including the local women they cavorted with. The most joyous
    passages describe the news of peace on 12 November 1918: "Hiked down town &
    played a parade to Hotel de Ville. Some wild crowd. Played 2 hour concert &
    then back to camp. . . . Some wild mob on the streets tonight, everybody
    happy & doing lots of yelling, laughing & celebrating in all ways."

    with the North Dakota National Guard, and his printed folding map of France.

    David Woodrow Wilson (1917-2007) of Larchmont, NY had an unusual and
    eventful experience in the war. He had been a 6'5" tennis star at Columbia
    University, but was not drafted because of imperfect eyesight. Eager to
    serve the cause, he signed up as an ambulance driver with the American Field
    Service, who sent him to North Africa. He was attached to the British Eighth
    Army as they pressed the Axis from Syria all the way to Tunisia. <br><br>His
    diary begins on 20 May 1942 with an 82-day passage by Dutch freighter across
    the Atlantic and around the Cape of Good Hope, followed by two months in
    Syria, tending to a regiment of Nepalese Gurkhas. On 12 October 1942 he was
    suddenly dispatched for the desert front. In Egypt on 25 October he reported
    "One of my section is from Free French who are just north of Qattara
    depression, ambulance shot full of holes. As he was dragging patient out to
    safety, explosive bullet hit & killed patient. Stuck in sand & had to await
    tank to be pulled." On 6 November near Daba, Egypt: "My first sight of
    soldiers killed in action, lying right beside road, already beginning to
    smell. Booby traps all around, and even though there is lots of loot to pick
    up, it is best to be careful. Several in CCS [Casualty Clearing Station]
    from those set off by fountain pens, water bottles, etc." He crossed into
    Libya on 15 November. After weeks in the desert with no bath, he washed his
    clothing in petrol on 1 December. On 8 January 1943, he wrote "Camp on road
    about 70 miles from Benghazi. Patient sleeps right next to me with
    contagious jaundice--great sport!" Pressing into Tunisia, he reported on 7
    April "Germans retreating now. . . . Several hundred Jerry prisoners pass by
    walking to POW cages." Outside of Tunis on 7 May, "we take 4 Jerry wounded
    back to CCS, looting their kit as we go; can't say I dealt gently with
    bumps. . . . They were very young and dead tired, probably hadn't slept in
    four days." The next day, entering liberated Tunis, was "the most exciting
    day of my life. . . . The people are wild, cheering, clapping, throwing
    flowers. . . . Climb aboard a Churchill tank and feel like Caesar as we
    acknowledge acclaim of crowds." This festive day was a fitting end to his
    year of service, and he was soon en route homeward; the diary ends on 20
    May, with a few additional memoranda about some Egyptian sightseeing and the
    trip home. Mason spent most of his long postwar life in Fryeburg, ME, where
    he ran a camp. <br><br>Included with the diary are 66 photographs from this
    period, showing Mason and his fellow drivers as well as the North African
    scenery. One shows an American Field Service ambulance with its front tire
    blown off by a land mine (illustrated). Other ephemera includes a large
    folding map of northern Egypt; a paperback war-era history titled "The
    Conquest of North Africa"; 8 pieces of paper money collected from various
    nations; 3 period newspaper clippings; an air-dropped safe-conduct pass

    Jack Clarence Doyle (1916-1983) was an Oregon native who met his sweetheart,
    Kathryn Ramsey of Richmond, VA, shortly before his enlistment as a corporal.
    Offered here are approximately 120 of his letters to Kathryn written during
    his military service, a mix of Autograph Letters Signed and V-Mail. In his
    first letter to Kathryn on 26 December 1942, he wrote "Darling, the only
    regret I have is that we didn't go through with it last night. But maybe as
    your mother said, it will all work out for the best. Believe me, though,
    darling, I'm yours. All we have to do is wait." Typically for World War Two
    letters, he was unable to offer many specific details of his service due to
    military censors. We do know that his unit, the 8th Tactical Air
    Communication Squadron, served in the European theater and had an impressive
    accomplishment: on D-Day, they were the only air support unit to make it
    ashore with working radio equipment, improvising radio contact with Air
    Force pilots and diverting them to important targets (see Cooling, Case
    Studies in the Development of Close Air Support, page 257). His first extant
    letter after the landing is a V-Mail dated 21 June 1944, "Somewhere in
    France": "Still live & kicking, honey, getting tired of sleeping in
    foxholes, etc. . . . There are about three things I'd like to have: a good
    bath, an honest to goodness meal, and last a good bed. Boy! I could really
    do justice to them all." On 26 June, the day the Allied forces captured
    Cherbourg as their first port on the continent, he wrote "This will probably
    be a memorable day and will go down in history no doubt. . . . It is
    unfavorable as far as the weather goes. That is about all I can tell you. .
    . . Am beginning to pick up a little French, if you can imagine. The people
    in here overall now are very friendly, and give us milk, butter, and other
    things to eat. In return we give them cigarettes, candy, etc." <br><br>Also
    included in the lot are approximately 60 war-date letters from Kathryn to
    Jack; 40-plus other personal letters, mostly war-date; a printed roster and
    home address list of Jack's squadron (he is listed under Oregon);
    approximately 50 pre-and post-war family photographs and album; two pocket
    New Testaments presented to Doyle during wartime; and other ephemera.
    <br><br>Doyle was discharged as a sergeant at the conclusion of the war,
    with his final letter dated 24 September 1945 from England. Records show
    that he and Kathryn were married on 29 October. His death certificate
    indicates that he drove an oil truck in Richmond until his retirement.

    "Segunda edicion, corregida y aumentada" of the influential works of José

    of Cuba. Exiled in 1823 for supporting independence, he issued his first
    volume of poetry in New York in 1825, shortly before joining the Cuban exile
    community in Mexico. This second edition is substantially expanded and

    This drawing was done during the visit of a delegation to the Dominican
    Republic in 1871. Ulysses Grant, the president of the United States, had
    proposed annexing the small island nation, but had not received approval
    from Congress. He sent a group of diplomats including Frederick Douglass on
    a mission to salvage the deal. Accompanying the delegation was James E.
    Taylor (1839-1901), who had made his reputation as a Civil War sketch artist
    and reporter for Frank Leslie's Weekly, and continued with the paper until
    1883. Several of his drawings from this trip were engraved for Leslie's,
    starting with the 11 March issue. <br><br>This drawing, which does not seem
    to have been published in Leslie's, depicts Dominican officers and soldiers
    in dress uniform, apparently preparing to march in a military parade. The
    standard-bearer can be seen in the foreground tying his shoes, with the
    musicians behind him, then troops arranged in rows apparently taking
    instruction from a drill sergeant. Officers in dress uniform can be seen to
    the left and on horseback in the background, and the Dominican flag flies
    overhead. The occasion may have been a 27 February dispute in which Haitian
    troops were said to be marching on the city of Azua, and Dominican troops
    prepared to face them. The New York Daily Herald of 17 March 1871 wrote:
    "This military parade has served the purpose, for it has impressed the
    Commissioners with an idea that all the trouble comes from Hayti."

    es muy util y en el se allan diversos pasteles, estofados, postres,
    chanfainas, sopas &c." A few clues point to a possible origin in the

    for "tortitas de huebo oajaqueña," and several recipes (pages 20, 39, 87
    etc.) featuring the chilguacle [chilhuacle] chile, grown only in Oaxaca.
    Other Mexican dishes include "vaca beracrusana" (23) and "guiso beracrusano"
    (35), the stew called manchamanteles (57), tortillas reyenas (67), and in
    the dessert realm, torta de mamey (78). A small diagram for serving salad

    A portrait of Juan de Palafox y Mendoza (1600-1659), an important and
    influential Bishop of Puebla from 1640 to 1655 who also served briefly as
    Viceroy of New Spain in 1642. He established the first public library in the
    Americas, and defended the rights of Indians. He is best known for his
    lengthy power struggle with the Jesuits of New Spain. <br><br>This
    allegorical portrait was likely created in support of Palafox's long process
    of beatification, which first received papal approval in 1726, and moved
    forward with an examination of his writings in 1758 (it was not concluded
    successfully until 2011). It depicts a beardless Palafox surrounded by seven
    women bearing emblems pertinent to his career. The caption circling his
    images reads in Latin "Ven Ioannes de Palafox episcopus angelopolitan et
    postea oxomen," surrounded by an elaborate array of saints bearing tribute.
    At bottom are the additional captions "Ingentes animas prograndia nomina
    prasal unicus, at gemino spiritu adauctus habet" and "Totus amor virtus
    sapienta gratis totus, cui sacra candet ovis cui sacra plaudit avis."
    <br><br>This painting appears to be the source image for at least two period
    engravings, and possibly three. A 1760 engraving attributed to Franz Regis
    Göz [Goetz] is held by the National Library of Spain. The other was engraved
    by [Francisco] Gutierrez circa 1780-1810; an example was sold by Swann on 10
    March 2020, lot 346. A similar but distinct composition by Juan Bernabé
    Palamino after Antonio Velazquez was used to illustrate the 1762 Madrid
    edition of the Works of Palafox (a copy is held by the John Carter Brown
    Library). <br><br>Provenance: Alcalá Subastas in Madrid, 7 October 2015, lot

    12 of these images are albumen photographs credited to the well-known
    Mexican photographer Abel Briquet, either in the printed caption slip,
    signed in the negative, or both. Briquet was born in France and became one
    of Mexico's first well-known commercial photographers. Most of these images
    are landscapes from his "Vistas, Mexicanas" series including the cathedral
    and national palace in Mexico City, the tomb of Juarez, three of the
    Chapultepec castle and its forest, and two ranch scenes from the scenic
    mountain town of Amecameca. Also included are two figures in traditional
    dress headed "Tipos, Mexicanos, Estado de Mexico" and another headed
    "Antiguedades, Mexicanas, Piedra de los Sacrificios, Museo Nacional de
    Mexico." One final uncredited Mexican photograph shows the city of Zacatecas
    from a distance. Finally, at the end of the volume is a cyanotype photograph
    of an imposing urban residence--we suspect the compiler's home in Memphis.
    <br><br>The compiler was William Horatio Bates (1841-1918) of Memphis, TN,
    president of S.C. Toof & Company, Printers, Lithographers, and Binders, the
    firm which not coincidentally also produced this handsome custom binding.
    The Memphis Daily Commercial of 31 March 1890 reports on the return of Bates
    from a business trip to Mexico, where he attended a bullfight and was
    "treated to all interesting sights peculiar to the region and the mercurial
    people of their tropical land, exotic vegetation and erotic individuality."

    Andrade in 1666 and 1667. "The interest of the work, excluding some
    ‘jesuitical chaff’, is not inferior to its rarity, as it contains accounts
    of many early voyages to the Indies, not elsewhere to be found"--Sabin
    55269. European Americana 643/89; Medina BHA II:1053; Palau 191023. We find

    This view was done shortly after the Uruguayan Civil War, in which
    Montevideo lay under siege for 8 years through 1851. The city had a large
    Italian population, and prominent among its defenders was an Italian legion
    led by Giuseppe Garibaldi. With peace, the city grew quickly as a mercantile
    port. This view shows a harbor packed with vessels bearing the flags of the
    United States, Italy, France, and more. A rowboat in the lower right bears
    the flag of Uruguay. An elaborately stylized version of the coat of arms of
    Uruguay appears in the lower margin.
