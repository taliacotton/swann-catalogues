    inscription to Edmond Picard from Verlaine to front free endpaper. First
    Edition. The inscription reads: "à Monsieur Edmond Picard/ hommage
    affectueux/ P. Verlaine."Mes Prisons is an account of the various prisons
    endured by the great poet, beginning with the school "dungeon" where he was
    sent as a child for an incorrect Latin conjugation through several
    incarcerations for disturbing the peace as an adult. Most of this book is
    concerned with his two-year sentence to Mons prison (of which he served 18
    months) for the murder of Arthur Rimbaud, his lover, in Brussels, on July
    12, 1873. Verlaine discusses the shooting and the trial, his life in prison
    afterwards and the various psychic prisons he has since occupied.Picard
    (1836-1924) was Verlaine's lawyer in the Rimbaud affair and one of the
    poet's closest friends. Also a distinguished journalist, playwright and
    patron of the arts, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in literature five
    times. A lecture Verlaine delivered on his prison experiences in Picard's
    home was the basis of Mes Prisons. This lecture was arranged by Octave Maus,
    a Belgian art critic, writer and lawyer. His invitation to Verlaine asked
    for a presentation that would "have a little bearing on the law.... [I]t
    might be interesting to hear your account of your judicial dealings in
    Belgium.... My Prisons by Paul Verlaine-what an alluring title for a
    lecture" (cited in Richardson). This presentation was a notable event.
    According to Petitfils, it was attended by all of Belgium's most important
    writers. Richardson, Verlaine 303. Petitfils, Verlaine 398-403.

    stamped in black, gilt-stamped spine. Inscribed by Carpenter: "To George
    Ives / in friendship from / E.C." dated March 1905 and penciled note
    beneath: "Whose is the work of which this is only the fore-runner?" First
    and only English Edition. Inscribed by the "Gay Godfather of the British
    Left" to a fellow activist.Carpenter was an English writer, reformer and
    lifelong advocate of gay liberation. Disenchanted with what he perceived as
    the hypocrisy of Victorian society, he abandoned his life in Cambridge as a
    scholar and cleric and moved to northern England. Referred to by many in
    recent years as "the gay godfather of the British left," Carpenter's radical
    politics and open relationship with his partner George Merrill influenced
    many activists and writers, including E.M. Forster, whose visit to the
    couple in 1913 inspired his novel "Maurice."

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This work on prison reform, prefaced by an excerpt from The Ballad of
    Reading Gaol" is inscribed to a close friend and activist, George Ives.
    Together with several others, they founded the progressive British Society
    for the Study of Six Psychology, which promoted both sexual liberation and
    education through a rational approach to sexual conduct. Ives also
    independently established the Order of Chaeronea, a secret society meant to
    provide refuge from the prejudices of Victorian society and further the
    cause of gay liberation (among others, Wilde was rumored to be a member).
    The text itself is marked and, in a few places, annotated or corrected in
    ink, most likely by Ives based on the initials "G.I." after one note, but
    possibly by Carpenter as well. Among the work's influences is Clarence
    Darrow, the American lawyer who also wrote extensively on penology and
    prisons. A French edition was published by Schleicher in 1907.

    Archive of 101 costume designs and related correspondence for the play
    "Kassa."
  TYPESET: >-
    14 brown paper folders separating contents by scene. Each folder contains a
    lined, folded notebook sheet with a notary seal on cover and occasional
    fabric swatches for the realized costumes; contents hold Anderson's costume
    drawings in watercolor, ink, and wash, the versos contain notations and
    signatures used in English legal court proceedings over the dispute between
    Anderson and Kassa's playwright, John Luther Long (see note). Average
    measurement of drawings is 254x180 mm; 10x7¼ inches; nearly all bear
    Anderson's monogram. Lined notebook sheets measure 12¾x8 inches. Presumed to
    be complete. A fascinating archive of costume designs for a grand-scale,
    early 20th century stage production. Kassa was an Edwardian-era
    dramatization of the story of "the broken butterfly" from the ancient
    Hunnish book. Its author, John Luther Long, was a collaborator of the great
    theatrical producer and playwright David Belasco, who first adapted Long's
    short story "Madame Butterfly" to the stage before Puccini adopted the
    libretto for what became his most famous opera. Kassa's leading lady was
    Mrs. Leslie Carter, among the greatest actresses of her generation,
    nicknamed "The American Sarah Bernhardt." The play premiered at the New
    National Theatre in Washington, D. C. on January 4, 1909 before traveling
    north to Broadway's Liberty Theatre for a short but well-attended run.
    Anderson was a prolific and successful English stage designer of opera and
    musical comedies, best known for his long tenures with the Savoy Operas,
    D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, and His Majesty's Theatre. Although focused on
    musical theatre professionally, socially Anderson also enjoyed the company
    of writers, artists and politicians, including Hamilton Aidé, Lord Ronald
    Gower and Hugh Walpole with whom he was closely associated. While Anderson's
    work was more rooted in 19th-century tradition, his work can be seen as an
    important forerunner of the more famous Avant-Garde stage designers Leon
    Bakst, Claude Lovat Fraser, and Edward Gordon Craig. Kassa's massive
    eighty-five member cast kept Anderson busy and the sheer number of designs
    in this archive display his dedication to the stylistic details demanded of
    the scenes and storyline. The attention to color, fabrics and finishes,
    historical style, accessories, and harmony of group attire are exquisite,
    each drawing enriched with his copious notes.Due to a disagreement regarding
    payment and use of the designs, legal action was brought by Anderson against
    Long for non-payment of these designs. The archive contains a few documents
    relating to this case including: a series of seven Typed Letters Signed by
    Long in 1908 from Philadelphia, relating to the staging and production of
    Kassa, and stating that Mrs. Leslie Carter was responsible for payment to
    Anderson for the costumes, a Manuscript Letter Signed by Anderson to Carter,
    1909, and the original mailing envelope with same notary seals as the
    folders, containing those contents, sent by Henry F. Walton, Esq. to the
    Court of Common Please in Philadelphia, stamped September 16, 1912.

    Duveneck. She worked as a book illustrator and was also known for her color
    intaglio prints and pastels.She had a lifelong relationship with Ethel Mars
    (1876-1959) who she met while a student at the Art Academy. They lived
    together in Paris and Provincetown, Massachusetts and were active in the art
    scenes. The couple were close with Gertrude Stein whose work Miss Furr and
    Miss Skeene (believed to be the first work to use the work "gay" to relate
    to homosexuality) is thought to be based on Mars and Squire's relationship.

    artist who studied and taught in the U.S. and abroad, there exists little
    biographical coverage of Cushing, much as a result of his heirs destroying
    evidence of his sexuality. Most prolific at the turn of the century when
    commercial illustration hit its stride in magazines and newspapers, he was
    influenced by his contemporaries J.C. Leyendecker, Aubrey Beardsley and his
    admittedly favorite illustrator, Lord Frederic Leighton. Art historians have
    remarked that across his body of work, a clear homoeroticism can be detected
    in the proportions and the haughty attitude of his young male subjects,
    evidenced here by the dance's onlookers.

    Paul Swan was an American painter, sculptor, dancer, poet, and actor, known
    for his beauty, unconventional behavior, and gender nonconformity. He
    performed Greek-inspired dance throughout his career, finding it to be a
    near-perfect mode of expression. His near nude performances shocked even
    Paris, where he performed for a time in the 1930s. Later he held weekly
    Sunday dance recitals from his studio in Carnegie Hall (1939-1969). His
    approach, which remained unchanged over the decades, came to be perceived as
    campy, and Andy Warhol included him in his 1965 underground film Camp.
    Swan's many faceted career also included appearances in silent films,
    including Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments, and painting and
    sculpture commissions. His bust of Willa Cather is in the Nebraska Capitol
    Building.

  at-a-glance: ''
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This photograph comes from a group of approximately 20 silver prints that
    were discovered in two manila envelopes (like the unmarked envelopes that
    were used to send risqué and "illegal" material through the mail in the
    first part of the 20th century) in the Monroe Wheeler Estate. The envelopes
    were marked "Intimacies" and "MW-GPL PRIVATE." 


    George Platt Lynes and Wheeler met in 1927 when Lynes was 20, and these
    photographs were presumably made of and by each other early in their
    relationship (this also corresponds to Lynes' introduction to photography).
    The prints were found in a box that held personal mementoes, private notes
    and letters, some physique images cut out from magazines, and gifts given
    to/from the Lynes-Wheeler-Glenway Wescott triad, including a small bottle of
    "Love Potion No. 9" and a set of diamond-studded cufflinks with a note from
    Lynes to Monroe expressing his love. The boxes were stored in an attic for
    25 years, untouched, along with other private material from Monroe Wheeler's
    Estate that was left to Anatole Pohorilenko and left untouched until
    Pohorilenko's death in 2014. 


    We can presume that they were only seen by the trio and possibly some very
    close friends. In most cases, the images are unique. This image is one of
    three copies, each of which are very slight variants (mostly differences in
    the size of the borders and paper, including a cropped version of the larger
    image). The print is warm-toned and lush in its treatment of the human form,
    here both velvety rich and defined with compelling contrast.


    The photographs are now housed in the Monroe Wheeler Archive, and to date
    they have largely not been shown, other than four that were included in
    David Zwirner's 2019 exhibition The Young and Evil: Queer Modernism in New
    York, 1930-1955. This image is the endpaper for the accompanying book (and
    on page 16), which was edited by Jarrett Earnest, and with text by Earnest,
    Ann Reynolds, and Kenneth E. Silver.

    Samuel Horace Littlefield, a Harvard-educated medical doctor, he was known
    for his strength in drawing but did not practice fine art at university. He
    studied privately under Adeleine Wolever, Charles Woodbury, and Edmund
    Tarbell. In 1925 he met Nicholas Podiapolski, his future lover and muse that
    inspired his early practice. Littlefield became acquainted with Lincoln
    Kirstein and his circle in New England. In October of 1934, at Kirstein's
    request, Littlefield created the stage sets for Serenade and Mozartiana, the
    American Ballet of New York's first production, performed at the Wadsworth
    Atheneum in Hartford.After the passing of his parents, he devoted himself to
    art criticism, painting, and arts administration in Provincetown and became

    Watercolor and pastels on green wove paper, 622x469 mm; 24½x18½ inches.
    Signed and dated in pencil, right center. 1938.Provenance: acquired directly
    from the artist's brother Joseph Delaney; private collection.This sensitive
    portrait is an early work by Beauford Delaney, made while he was living and
    working in Greenwich Village. He settled in the Village due to his ideals of
    integration and a bohemian lifestyle that he saw fit for himself. Delaney
    painted portraits of friends, supporters, and public figures relevant to
    him. His social consciousness led him to portray his friends and associated
    with all racial and sexual backgrounds. He depicted both black and white
    people, and the hetero-normative and queer residents of the Village. Delaney
    lived a romantically solitary life as he chose not to express his underlying
    sexuality due to his strict religious upbringing and the politics of the
    era.

  TYPESET: >-
    Watercolor and ink on cream wove paper, 220x245 mm; 8⅞x9⅞ inches. Signed in
    ink, lower right. 1991.Provenance: gift from the artist to art historian,
    Karl Lunde; acquired by descent, private collection, NJ (2009).Exhibition:
    Avel de Knight: Paysages Intimes, La Maison Française New York University,
    March 1-24, 1993.Appearing as if a mirage, out of an apparition, Avel de
    Knight's Saint Sebastian (Père Lachaise) is a powerful symbol of the early
    Christian saint and martyr. Saint Sebastian was executed for converting his
    fellow Roman soldiers to Christianity. Then rehabilitated by a pious widow
    but faced the Roman Emperor and beaten to death.Spiritual members of the
    queer community have come to view him as a queer icon and martyr due to his
    eroticized portrayals that began within late nineteenth-century gay circles.
    De Knight and many artists before him were inspired by the symbolism of the
    arrows penetrating his body, countenance of rapturous pain, and resilience
    in the face of persecution resonating with them. The location, Père
    Lachaise, acts as an ideal memorial and conjuring site for the martyr, which
    is in tune with De Knight's sense of myth and romanticism.

    Double-sided color drawing, with notations in French, by Tennant, within

    mm; 9¼x7⅞ inches, full sheet, the paper once folded in half horizontally,
    with hard fold (partly separating). Signed "Stephen Tennant" in ink. Recto
    contains numerous portraits of Marseille locals. A note in the upper right
    corner reads (in English) "A book doesn't need a precedent." The verso
    contains a verdant waterside scene of nude women among grapevines, rendered
    in yellow, with a small menu sketched below signature, reading "Le Café
    Brasil." British writer and aristocrat Stephen Tennant cultivated a life of
    glamour if accomplishing little professionally during his life. As one of
    the most colorful members of London's "Bright Young Things," the group of
    Bohemian socialites in the 1920s, he stood out for his flamboyance, beauty,
    and wit, among his more productive companions who included Harold Acton,
    Cecil Beaton, Evelyn Waugh, the Mitfords and the Sitwells, though he did
    inspire numerous characters in their novels. His own literary and artistic
    ambitions were fostered by such illustrious friends as Willa Cather, E.M.
    Forster, the Bloomsbury Group members, and Siegfried Sassoon, with whom he
    had a romantic relationship. The majority of his surviving - and now coveted
    - writing and artwork was centered around his novel "Lascar," which remained
    unfinished at his death, despite several decades devoted to its creation.
    Some of the drawings for Lascar have come on the market and the ones offered
    here, which bear a strong resemblance to those, may also have been intended
    for the book.

    almost daily from January to September 1948, plus a few scattered long
    entries in February 1950 and November 1952.
  at-a-glance: ''
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This young man (not named in our catalog because he was not a public figure)
    began this diary in the navy, working at the neuro-psychiatric ward in a
    naval hospital in San Diego. The bulk was written in 1948, spending a spring
    semester enrolled at Arizona State University in Flagstaff and then off to
    the beaches of Los Angeles. The author often annotated the diary with
    sequential circled numbers in the margins. For example on 9 May 1948 in
    Arizona, he wrote "met a rebel named Preston & spent the nite out at
    Barker's Village," noting it with a circled "18." On 17 May, "met two Navy
    men, Art & Ralph. . . . They came in & Art & I went to the museum for a
    drink. We later met Ralph. Then home--very late to bed." This entry earned a
    circled "19" and "20." On 22 May "went into town for a final night in
    Flag[staff]. The usual # of drunks, Indians & cowboys, etc. Fooled around &
    then slept in penthouse of Bury Hall." A circled "22" is next to this entry.
    Visiting Tucson on 17 June, "met a Bill J from Houston and we fooled around
    until I left at 9:30." This was number 25. He spent the summer of 1948 in
    Los Angeles, where he became less cryptic. On 24 June 1948, "read a
    marvelous book 'The City and the Pilar' by Gore Vidal. I want to buy a copy
    as it is something, for me, of a textbook." "The City and the Pillar" was
    the most prominent novel of its era to feature a gay protagonist. He added
    (with circled numbers "27" and "½"): "Slept out one night in Venice . . .
    God! What a life! I want to stop being so damned foolish and wait for the
    right one. . . . I feel like an imposter among imposters, yet am not a
    member elsewhere! . . . There are three people here whom I think quite nice
    and not so ordinary as most of these faggots." Our diarist had little income
    and sometimes slept on the beach. On 25 June 1948, he circled a "28" after
    writing "Listened to music at Zanzibar, was done for trade & then home." The
    next day, he notched 29 and 30: "Oh, if only one event hadn't happened! I
    hope I'm not going to the dogs and can maintain control of myself. Feel so
    disgusted and ashamed, all the way through. Got into town & . . . fooled
    around--Army--was trade again." He soon stopped numbering his encounters. On
    2 July, "We went down to the Square, the Circle, Maxwell's, etc. What places
    those are! All the mad faggots in town gather and laugh & be aloof with/to
    each other." On 7 August, "spent last night on the beach. Rather tiring. I
    was trade." Our author began taking classes at UCLA, in 1949 transferred to
    Arizona State University, and announced proudly on 31 January 1950 that he
    was awarded his Bachelor of Science degree in Social Welfare. A long entry
    in February 1952 documents his return to California, where he found himself
    "an habitué of Dopey's, fountain hangout of the Ocean Park Shady Side:
    queers, mugs, whores, beauty parlor operators, pimps, gamblers, police & a
    few neighbors who just didn't care. Dopey was a big fat character who lived
    over the fountain. He used to drag his tricks up there. The apt. had a
    peephole & often he would let friends use it & then watch their performance
    through the hole." He also describes a violent incident at a drag ball where
    a thug attacked one of the performers: "We hid in an irrigation ditch & the
    rest of the summer were scared of Sonny." Tucked into the diary is a small
    photograph of the author. It is unsigned, but matches a portrait of the
    author in a drum major competition which appeared in a 1941 newspaper (copy
    enclosed).

    Today McBean is also considered a cult figure associated with surrealism. In
    addition to his "surrealized" portraits of actresses such as Audrey Hepburn
    and Vivien Leigh, McBean created inventive tableuax that featured elaborate
    miniatures he designed and construced himself, spending weeks to achieve the
    desired effect. These images often served as McBean's Christmas cards, but
    this large, gorgeously hand-colored silver print is an usual and exceedingly
    rare oversized example of this work. In it, a nude male figure emerges from
    the sand under a dreamy pastel sky. In the background, a mysterious figure
    in gold underneath a tattered sail beckons.

  DESCRIPT: SAMUEL STEWART (1909-1993)
  CROSSHEAD: Untitled.
  TYPESET: >-
    Watercolor and ink on wove paper, 241x374 mm; 9½x14¾inches.Provenance:
    estate of the artist; acquired by the Johnny Cakes Books, Salisbury,
    Connecticut; purchased from above, 2014 by current owner, private
    collection, New York.Raised in a Protestant household fearing sexuality,
    Samuel Stewart quickly realized he was attracted to other boys. Stewart
    attended Ohio State University and graduated with a Ph.D. in English in the
    early 1930s. He taught at Ohio State during his last year there and, after
    graduation, moved around to teaching positions at Carroll College in
    Montana, Washington State University, and Loyola University in Chicago. He
    arrived at Loyola in 1937, but left academia believing it didn't afford him
    enough time for writing or his other passion, tattooing. He used the moniker
    Phil Sparrow in the early 1960s as a tattoo artist on Chicago's notorious
    South State Street. Steward worked closely with Alfred Kinsey on his
    landmark sex research. In 1964, he took his tattooing skills to California
    when he relocated to the East Bay Area. He was the tattoo artist of the
    Hells Angels Motorcycle club. Stewart became an intimate friend of Gertrude
    Stein, Alice B. Toklas, and Thornton Wilder while maintaining a secret sex
    life from childhood on and documented these experiences in brilliantly vivid
    (and often very funny) detail.Using the aliases Ward States, John McAndrews,
    and Donald Bishop, he was a prolific essayist in the first European gay
    magazines; as Phil Andros, he was the author of a series of popular
    pornographic gay novels during the 1960s and 1970s. He used drugs throughout
    his life and became addicted to barbiturates at the end of his life. He also
    struggled with his psychological health, suffering "through long periods of
    dark depression, loneliness and self-destructive behavior."

    signed this drawing. He was an American underground artist of gay erotic art
    whose career began in the 1930s and is best known for his 1948 series of
    drawings "The Barn." Like many artists, his work was initially distributed
    underground as a result of American obscenity laws. His first one-man show
    was held at the Leslie-Lohman Gallery in SoHo in November of 1980. Its
    success launched him into greater popularity and his most artistically
    productive decade. Bate died on June 27, 1989, the twentieth anniversary of
    the Stonewall riot.

    unevenly trimmed. Signed and dated "Brian Stonehouse-N.Y.C. 1956" in lower
    right image. Tipped to matte and framed. Stonehouse was a fascinating
    figure. He served as a World War II spy and went on to become one of the
    most prominent fashion illustrators throughout the 1950s-60s.British born
    but raised in France, his artistic and translation skills earned him the
    position of Special Operations Executive during the war. He was captured and
    sent to prison in Germany where, for a time, an SS guard who was sympathetic
    and appreciated his skills, assigned him to create portraits of officers and
    their families. He barely survived further imprisonment and concentration
    camps and formed the International Prisoners Committee with fellow British
    officers, assisting war victims and raising morale until Liberation Day in
    1945. After the war, he resumed his artistic ambitions, emigrating to New
    York and becoming the first fashion illustrator hired by Vogue since 1939.
    For the next three decades, his work for Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and print
    advertising focused on women's fashion, until the liberal air of the 70's
    allowed him the freedom of expression to begin creating homoerotic imagery
    and fine art. Only a small body of his original artwork survives, though a
    small but excellent show of his drawings was on display at the Henry Miller
    Fine Arts exhibition at Coningsby Gallery in England last year.

  CROSSHEAD: Untitled (Erotic Fantasy).
  TYPESET: >-
    Ink on paper. 420x293 mm; 16½x11¾ inches. Unsigned. Circa 1959. Unexamined
    out of archival frame. This wild work is a homoerotic take on Hieronymous
    Bosch's The Garden of Earthly Delights with human and fantastical creatures
    engaged in myriad ithyphallic activities. Steward was an early and wildly
    prolific pioneer of the erotic arts and somewhat of a Renaissance man. He
    was a young friend of Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, Thomas Mann, André
    Gide, and Thornton Wilder, who influenced his early endeavors as a poet,
    novelist, and professor of English Literature. Leaving academia to become a
    tattoo artist under the tutelage of Admund Dietzel, he eventually became the
    official inker of the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang. In the 1960s he
    published a series of extremely popular erotica, often on the themes of
    sadomasochism and interracial relations, under the name of Phil Andros.
    Throughout these periods, he was also a spiritualist, (unofficial) sex
    researcher for Alfred Kinsey (with whom he shared his detailed sex journals
    and photographs), a pulp pornographer, and homoerotic artist/illustrator,
    sometimes under his own name or pseudonymously. Among biographies of
    pioneering gay figures, Steward's is certainly one the most fascinating and
    entertaining.

    she worked with another Black drag queen, Lottie LaBeija, to host a ball for
    Black queens. Their first event was the first to be hosted by a House, for
    which the term was coined. Cyrstal LaBeija would become the founder of the

    depicted standing with his palette in front of an easel on which rests his
    1948 painting Harvasu CreekGeorge Quaintance is well-known for his idealized
    and homoerotic depictions of men in mid-20th-century physique magazines.
    Chiseled cowboys and idealized male bodies populate his imagery, turning a
    queer gaze on subject matter that was at times historical and always
    traditionally heteronormative. His work helped to establish the macho motif
    pervasive in gay imagery and influencing artists such as Tom of Finland.

    Oil on canvas. 610x610 mm; 24x24 inches. Signed in canvas, lower right.
    1940. Quaintance was one of the early American pioneers of homoerotic
    fantasy art. His illustrations for Physique Pictorial magazine in the early
    1950s helped to popularize his work. While best known for his images of
    overtly masculine and campy cowboys, gods, matadors, and other idealized
    physical specimens, he was also an accomplished portrait painter and
    landscapist. Outside of his portraiture, there are few known images of women
    in his ouevre. This monochromatic canvas is a particularly beautiful and
    sensual study of the female form.Provenance: Private collection, Los
    Angeles. Literature:  Dian Hanson and Reed Massengill, Quaintance, (New

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Under the name Champion Studio, Walter Kundzicz became one of the last great
    pioneers of physique photography when he entered the field in the late
    1950s. Unlike the muscle-bound beefcake imagery of earlier the decade,
    Champion's handsome young models were a new breed. Not only did Kundzicz
    push legal boundaries with sexier props and more revealing imagery, his
    color photographs also pushed the established aesthetics, featuring sunny,

    Pencil with white heightening in gouache on paper.  430x353 mm; 17x13⅞
    inches.  Signed with the artist's pseudonym "Colt" and dated in pencil,
    lower left recto, and signed in pencil, verso.  1968.Provenance: Private
    collection, California. Jim French began drawing, and then photographing,
    male erotica in the 1960s. As a successful fashion illustrator, he and a
    friend co-founded a mail order company in New York City they named Lüger, to
    which French contributed homoerotic drawings of hyper-masculine types such
    as bikers, soldiers, and cowboys. He eventually bought out his business
    partner and by 1967, under the pseudonym Rip Colt, he founded Colt Studio.
    There he created highly detailed drawings for various Colt Studio books,
    magazines, and calendars, such as this lot. He soon turned to the Polaroid
    camera to shoot photographs of posed male models to serve as guides for his
    drawings, ultimately building a formidable reputation for himself as one of
    the most important photographers of the male form. French's fine art
    training and drawing skills can be credited for that success. As Nat
    Gozzano, COLT Studio’s archivist and art director since 1997, noted: “As
    opposed to the early male pin-ups that were for gay audiences, but still
    masquerading as muscle magazines and athletic training magazines, Jim was
    more directly tailoring his images to the taste of gay audiences. His
    composition was so strong and from life drawing classes, he really knew how
    to pose models with strong tension in their bodies – and that set him apart
    from other people right away.”

    Ink and graphite on paper.  290x270 mm; 11½x10¾ inches, sheet. 1981.
    Stamp-signed in Japanese, upper right; dated year, month/day "1981 2/15"
    lower left. Loose and cornered to matte. Provenance: Private collection, Los
    Angeles. Hasegawa was a master of homoerotic fetish art, often within
    fantastical and mystical settings, featuring Indian, Thai, Tibetan Buddhist,
    African, Japanese, and Balinese elements influenced by his extensive
    travels. Now recognized as one of the most influential creators of
    homoerotic art in Japan and throughout the global queer community,
    Hawegawa's reputation was fairly confined during his lifetime. He was
    prolific during his short life but commercially limited by his own refusal
    to distribute his work outside of Japan. His suicide at the age of 54
    shocked the art world and his influence might have narrowed even further
    when his family was prepared to destroy his remaining paintings. But a note
    he left near his portrait of an earlier queer Japanese writer and victim of
    suicide, Yukio Mishima, requested that the work he left behind be donated to
    Gallery Naruyama in Tokyo, who currently holds the majority of his collected
    works. Aside from their collection and limited appearances in gay magazines,
    Hasegawa's monograph Paradise Vision (1996 Kochi Studio) has been the main
    gateway into his works.

    98" in lower left image. Tipped to matte and framed. Peruvian artist
    "Palanca" is known for his peculiar homo-fetish art, much of which involves

    about the fictional company "Dumbrella" became a jumping-off point to the
    broader genre of underground erotic drawings and comics. An ambitious
    self-promoter, by his mid-20s, he developed his pseudonym of Palanca (which
    means "lever" or "gear shift"), moved to Los Angeles, and made connections
    in the erotic and gay art circles there, most notably through the Tom of
    Finland Foundation, who honored him with a Tom's Award in 2007. Palanca's
    drawings have been published in European and American magazines including
    FootScene, Sneerzine, Honcho, and Inches.Provenance: Tom of Finland

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Berlin (born Armin Hagen Baron Freiherr von Hoyningen-Huene), trained as a
    photo-technician and worked as a photographer in his native Germany. He
    began designing and constructing his own clothing, some of the ensembles
    skin tight, which he wore cruising the streets in Berlin, where he lived,
    and then San Francisco, where he moved in the early 1970s and became Peter
    Berlin, his exhibitionist, ultra-sexual alter-ego. Berlin photographed his
    ensembles in erotic poses, and in addition to becoming a fixture on the
    streets, created a demand for his photographs as a mail-order business. With
    the increase in production, sometimes he would inadvertently underexpose
    some frames of film. Not wanting to waste any of the prints, Berlin began
    taking a brush with acrylic and oil paint or just a pencil to enhance the
    images.


    Berlin made a hard-core porn film with his friend Richard Abel titled Nights
    in Black Leather (1973), which became a cult hit, and led to other film
    projects, some of which were available as loops by mail order. He was
    photographed by Robert Mapplethorpe, silkscreened by Andy Warhol, and drawn
    by Tom of Finland. Radical, unusual, and dedicated to his life as Berlin
    from the early 70s until the late 80s, Berlin left an indelible mark. He
    gave a world starved of blatantly gay visual role models a new conception of
    the beautiful, empowered, self-loving, sensual, shameless gay man.

  DESCRIPT: JIMMY DESANA (1949-1990)
  CROSSHEAD: A portfolio titled 101 Nudes.
  TYPESET: >-
    A complete and sealed example of this important early series from
    photographer Jimmy DeSana, who was part of the counterculture punk community
    of artists in New York in the 1970s and 80s. The set includes 56 halftones,
    the overall sheets measuring 279.4x390.5 mm; 11x15⅜ inches, the printed
    title sheet with graphic red text; enclosed in the original plastic bag with
    a cardboard backing and a staped paper seal. 1972.
  at-a-glance: ''
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Gifted by the artist to Robert A. Stefanotti, his gallerist, in 1974. DeSana
    moved to New York in 1973 and gifted several copies of this portfolio to
    friends and acquaintances who helped him get established in the city. 


    The grainy, flash-lit images in this portfolio, partially influenced by
    1950s pornography, depict DeSana's friends and acquaintances posing nude in
    various domestic and suburban settings. Far from confrontational (indeed
    "without eroticism," as DeSana himself noted), the nudity here is organized
    around an examination of conformity, consumerism, sexual liberation, and
    queer identity. Printed himself on a small press (the images could not be
    commercially printed, given the subject matter), the images also recall the
    influence of Surrealism on the photographer.


    DeSana was a part of the counterculture "punk" community of artists and
    musicians living in Manhattan's East Village in the 1970s and 80s. His work
    is both personal and subversive, and his voice and perspective as complex
    and revolutionary today as it was then.

    a two-part exhibition, which took place at Hal Bromm Gallery, New York,
    during October and November, 1977. Here the work (on pg. 21) is titled My
    Latin Heritage/El Cansearch Presidente, from the Esoterrorist Series.
    Additional text accompanies the image.
  at-a-glance: ''
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The accompanying exhibition catalogue reads as follows: "The work is the
    first "PUNK" treatment of any of the existing object lines from the series
    'My Latin Heritage.' The 'My Latin Heritage' series is a personal historical
    myth construction of the artist's real and imaginary past. Here, the artist
    is seen in the bottom photo coupled with his regular photographer's image
    seen above in portrait. An indication of the master/slave relationship:
    photographer to subject. Who's on top? The graffiti advertises the FALN, a
    terrorist, Puerto-Rican liberation group; also it titles the top photograph
    of the artists' photographer Jimmy DeSana, as El Cansearch Presidente.
    Cansearch, is a cancer research institute, founded by the artist, and the
    art objects, such as this one , and his films, videotapes, etc, is the
    actual research itself, in the direction of understanding cancer. The piece
    should have an urgency to it: a quick, easy blow up of a not-posed-looking
    mug shot situation; a rushing to Press: to sell the FALN story: a believable
    sympathy/identification with FALN and art/terrorism. Finally, the piece is a
    direct outgrowth of my involvement with the ESOTERRORISTS, a street gang
    (Anya Phillips, Duncan Smith & myself): we support the notion of PUNK JUNK
    ROCK CANCER SEND. Our target is: CORP. CANCER RECEIVE." - Diego Cortez

    Acrylic on canvas, 1979. Signed, Fonseca, and dated, 79, lower left. Signed,
    Fonseca, dated, 6.22.79, and inscribed as titled on stretcher. 914x610 mm;
    36x24 inches. Harry Fonseca began his art career using imagery from his
    Native American Maidu heritage in his art. His Coyote Series of paintings
    started in 1979. These works use the coyote as the trickster of Maidu
    ancestral stories, depicted in nontraditional clothing and settings. In this
    painting Coyote is dressed in black leather and other aspects of queer-dress
    experienced by the artist in San Francisco, expressing Fonseca's personal
    narrative as a gay Native American living off-reservation.

    which my characters, perhaps, shared though the author not. But I was a
    realist back then--if you succeed in driving a stake through those false

    demonstrate that heterosexuality does not exist, one must first posit the

    Several illustrations. [48] pages. Octavo, illustrated purple wrappers,

    Book Service,1964]. Unauthorized second edition. The original report was
    commissioned by the Florida State Legislature to investigate an alleged
    epidemic of homosexuality, including "infiltration into agencies supported
    by state funds by practicing homosexuals." The resulting report is filled
    with moral outrage. Also included are several erotic photographs including a
    full-page shots of bondage and of oral sex being performed in a public
    restroom. A "Glossary of Homosexual Terms and Deviate Acts" extends to
    several pages, as does a "Bibliography on Sexual Deviations." The report was
    released in mid-March 1964. Copies were distributed to all Florida state
    legislators, and additional copies were available to the public for 25
    cents. The Florida attorney general, in shutting down the distribution of
    the original printing two days after its publication, warned that "It will
    become the object of curiosity in every school in the state and could
    engender perversion." This second edition was published in unauthorized
    facsimile by the Guild Book Service, the newly launched mail-order wing of
    H. Lynn Womack's Guild Press. The price was $2.00. Womack, who had
    previously been prosecuted and acquitted for sending pornographic gay
    material through the mail, was investigated by the Postal Investigation
    Service for mailing the government report.  He boasted of "substantial"
    sales of the "Purple Pamphlet" thanks in part to the legal case: "The
    publicity has been very helpful." His marketing brochure emphasized the
    erotic photography, promising that "this is the most amazing book that we
    have ever seen come from any public body." See Tampa Bay Times, 30 June
    1964; Miami Herald, 18 March 1964, 23 July 1964, 15 November 1964.

    as the first LGBTQ business association in the United States, uniting the
    owners of San Francisco's gay bars against police raids, supporting
    unemployed members, and staging an annual Beaux Arts Ball. They also raised
    money for a variety of causes within the LGBTQ community and beyond. The
    bulk of this lot consists of the Guild's mailings to members from 1971 to
    1993, most of them photocopies of typescripts on approximately 400
    letter-sized sheets. They include the formal minutes of general membership
    meetings (often containing lists of unemployed members), circular letters to
    the membership, newsletters, committee and treasurer reports, election
    ballots, membership lists, and more. A few records from the 1960s are

    history titled "The Tavern Guild: A Record of Accomplishment," and a copy of
    the Guild's constitution is stamped "Jul 1 1969." The bulk of the records

    sizes, consisting mostly of invoices and memoranda for regular expenses:
    printing of bar calendars and yearbooks, dues, event tickets and catering
    expenses, often stapled with register receipts or other related documents.
    Individual businesses are often named. A 19 April 1972 memorandum notes the
    deposit of a $1,000 "returned bail check." A sign-up sheet from the Guild's
    27 July 1971 meeting includes 78 signatures with their bar affilation.

    were held in front of Philadelphia's Independence Hall every year on the
    Fourth of July from 1965 to 1969. These "Annual Reminder" days were among
    the first organized gay rights protests in the United States, with a focus
    on equal employment opportunity. The 1969 march was the largest ever with
    150 participants, drawing on the excitement of the previous week's Stonewall
    Uprising. Printed copies of this sign can be seen in the hands of picketers
    at the 1969 Annual Reminder Day in several photographs by Nancy Tucker held
    by the National Constitution Center and in the Barbara Gittings Collection
    at the New York Public Library. Two copies can also be seen in the 2004
    documentary "Gay Pioneers," which also shows Frank Kameny with his

    original staple-bound illustrated wrappers, minor wear; numerous inked notes
    and marks including a light "X" through the Stonewall listing; early owner's
    inked stamp on title page. New York: Apollo Book Co., 1968. This guide was
    issued in late 1968, just a few months before the Stonewall Rebellion. The
    Stonewall is named in the listings of Manhattan bars: "It continues
    operating  amid persistent rumors of closing. Caters to a younger crowd who
    seem to spend all their time perfecting their dancing. Observers note that
    'go-go-boys' installed on platforms have failed to attract the dwindling
    crowds." The recent prosecution of the club's mobster co-owner for extortion
    and larceny is also discussed. In addition to the listings and ads, the
    guide includes longer pieces on political activism, the "Gay Cruising
    Scene," the Homosexual Bill of Rights, and "Wave of Killings Shock
    Homosexual Community." Other annual and quarterly editions of this guide
    were issued by the Mattachine Book Service, which is uncredited here but
    actually held the copyright per "The Stonewall Riots: A Documentary
    History," page 326.

    approach the subject from within. Whatever examples of gay power have been
    demonstrated thus far, whether it be through straight media or on the part
    of homosexuals themselves--it's either met with some kind of legal or
    ignorant interference or too one-sided a picture has been presented. Variety
    is the spice of life and Gay Power is by and for all people. A people is
    what we shall exemplify first not in any 'half see how far we can get'
    subtle way, but in the best entertaining and educational way"--from the

  TYPESET: >-
    Offset lithograph poster. 737x610mm; 29x24 inches. [New York]. 1987.This is
    the rare FIRST PRINTING of the poster, printed before the image was turned
    over to ACTUP. According to Avram Finkelstein, 1800 hundred copies of the
    poster were printed, "nine hundred posters, plus another nine hundred
    replacement posters" (After Silence p. 42)Provenance: from the collection of
    Christopher Lione. This is the second of two original editions of the poster
    kept by Mr. Lione.According to Lione, "the first printing by us of the
    Silence = Death poster (before ACT UP existed) is a custom size based on the
    proportions of our design. Subsequent printings (printed by ACT UP and
    others) are longer."The Silence=Death Collective formed in the early years
    of the AIDS epidemic including Avram Finkelstein, Chris Lione, Jorge
    Socarras, Oliver Johnston, Charles Kreloff and Brian Howard. This poster
    appropriated the Nazi regime's pink triangle for the Collective's own
    positive and empowered usage. The text at the bottom of the poster was
    printed in smaller typeface, "forcing intimate contact on the part of the
    reader…The poster was about complicity, at all levels, but it also needed to
    inspire action" (After Silence p. 48). In this first printing of the poster,
    a misunderstanding resulted in several misprints in the smaller text at the
    bottom. When the government agencies were actually spelled out to the
    typesetter of the poster they were misread as "The Center for Disease
    Control" as opposed to the "Centers" and it also read "Federal Drug
    Administration," instead of "Food and Drug Administration." The poster
    originally hit the streets in mid-March 1987, less than a month before ACT
    UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) was formed. The Collective eventually
    turned the rights of the poster to ACT UP who reprinted it, first without
    making any changes, but then reprinted it, again, with the correct names of
    the government agencies. This poster was not, as many have written, the work
    of artist collective Gran Fury. Gran Fury (named after the type of Plymouth
    automobile used by the New York City Police Department) formed in 1988, the
    year after this poster was designed.After Silence pl. 1, Aids Demographics

    four on a single sheet, include pink triangles on light blue, light green
    and black backgrounds along with two proposed text placements. "Silence is
    Death" was Johnston's original contribution to the Collective's search for
    an effective tagline for the poster (After Silence, p. 45), and during the
    design process "Oliver kept pushing for versions with brightly colored
    backgrounds" (ibid p. 47). These recently re-discovered sketches were left
    in the home of Silence=Death collective member, Jorge Socarras, after the
    final 1986 Silence=Death collective meeting at which Johnston drew them.
    They shed light on a pivotal moment of the visionary design process involved
    in originating the Silence=Death logo.Oliver Johnston was one of the
    original 6 members of the Silence=Death Collective. He was a graduate of
    Parsons and a graphic designer in his own right. He was the only member of
    the collective not to survive the AIDS era, he passed away from AIDS

    important, it was chosen for its ability to maximize point size within the
    narrowness of the poster's topography. The condensed font allowed for the
    increased vertical scale, giving maximum readability from a distance. It
    did, however, have kerning pitfalls. The space between the letters made for
    a very hard read. After the poster hit the streets, a few people asked us
    why science equals death. In the subsequent printing, we opened up the
    spaces between the I, L and E." (After Silence p. 47).Provenance: consigned
    by the Silence=Death Collective.

    chalk drawings on the unused advertising panels of the New York Subway
    stations, and would continue doing so for the next ten years to the delight
    of the city's commuters.  Barking dogs were among his repeated icons, along

    Etching on white wove paper.  252x225 mm; 10x9 inches, full margins. 
    Signed, dated and numbered 48/80 in pencil, lower right.  1989.Published in
    Littmann, Keith Haring, Editions on Paper, 1982-1990, Stuttgart, 1997, page
    141.The Valley is a collaboration between Haring, who made 16 separate
    etchings for the series, and the Beat Era poet and novelist William S.
    Burroughs, whose text-based "cut-up" method of writing influenced Haring’s
    pictographic style.  Reflecting a shift from Haring’s more light-hearted
    early works, The Valley series is dark and menacing, made during the final
    years of his life when he was living with AIDS.  Alongside his Apocalypse
    series (1988), this series introduces stylistic shifts of more complex
    compositions and characters such as jesters, masks, skills and martyrs. 
    This series tells the story of the valley people who live in hellish
    conditions, then rescued by people from the outside world.  Haring and
    Burroughs set up an "us" and "them" narrative in this series, notably around
    contamination from the valley people.  Thus, The Valley series strikes
    parallels with contemporary crises like the AIDS epidemic and functions as a
    compelling social commentary.A portion of Burroughs's corresponding text for
    this etching reads: "The Press, of course, wallowed in speculation and
    clamored to be allowed to interview the Valley people and take pictures.
    They were firmly admonished that the possibility of a virgin soil epidemic
    imposed emergency conditions.  No one but scientists and doctors from the
    CDC would be allowed access to the Valley people, unless or until there was
    no danger of an unknown disease agent getting loose in the world’s
    population."

    use the store's name on his design, and yet the images became advertising
    icons all the same). One of the bags featured a portrait of a woman on one

    widely known in the design world for his Louis Vuitton Graffiti logo bags
    created in collaboration with Marc Jacobs in 2000. He also designed the
    dress worn by Debbie Harry in the 1978 video for Heart of Glass. His punk
    style in design caught the attention of Andy Warhol. Through their
    friendship Sprouse began experimenting with media such as silk screen
    printing, photography, and collage. The recipient of this painting, John
    Reinhold, was friends with Stephen Sprouse and Andy Warhol. Reinhold, a
    jeweler, gave Warhol a jar of diamond dust suggesting he might incorporate
    it into his work. Andy Warhol's diamond dust works would follow.

    augmented by elaborate costumes, music, imagination combined with hippie
    psychedelia had catapulted them to local stardom and they were considered
    the darlings of the Bay City counterculture. Their fame led to a New York
    tour in 1971 where they were coupled with Sylvester. The show was not
    successful, with many of New York's downtown gliteratti walking out on
    opening nght. The show closed at the end of it's three week contract.
    Sylvester himself only performed for a few evenings before he heeded the

    Offset lithograph poster. 655x495mm; 25¾x19½ inches. 1992.<br>In 1992 drag
    queen and activist Terrance Alan Smith ran for president of the United
    States as Joan Jett-Blakk, representing the Queer Nation Party. Her
    memorable slogan from the ultimately unsuccessful campaign was "Lick Bush in
    '92." With plans to have Dykes on Bikes patrolling America's borders, and to
    paint the White House lavender, her campaign was effective in its cutting
    satire and helped bring queer issues into the American political debate. As
    Smith she was able to sneak in to the Democratic National Convention in
    Madison Square Garden, where she changed back into a star spangled mini
    dress and announced her candidacy from the floor of the convention. A
    performance that caused Pat Buchanon to proclaim that her appearance was
    "the greatest single exhibition of cross-dressing in American political
    history.” This poster borrows liberally from the famous Black Panther image
    from the early 1970s of an armed Huey Newton sitting in a wicker chair.

    as a "fuck you" response to Senator Jesse Helms's stance on banning obsence
    art from the NEA, Penny Arcade's show has been performed on and off ever

    to get up from our seats and dance, even as it nurses our political and

    Urvashi Vaid (October 1958 - May 2022) was an Indian-born American LGBTQ+
    rights activist, lawyer, and writer. She was the author of two books and
    held a series of roles at the National LGBTQ Task Force, including leading
    the organization (then called the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force)
    during the height of the AIDS crisis. Many years before intersectionality
    became a common approach to activism, she insisted that freedom for gay men
    and lesbians meant fighting for gender, racial, and economic equality as
    well. She also argued against fighting for access to the mainstream, instead
    fighting for power to change and alter it, a progressive position that was
    completely unique. “My understanding of liberation did not come from the
    feminist and gay activists with whom I worked, but rather from movements
    working to end colonial occupation and white supremacy,” she wrote on the
    website OpenDemocracy in 2014.


    Sue Hyde was the co-founder and, for 30 years, the Director of NGLTF’s
    Creating Change Conference. She is currently Executive Director and Board
    Secretary of the Wild Geese Foundation.

    producer John Glines; gifted to private collection, New York.Kenny Burgess's
    Untitled (Male Nude) is inspired by a scene from As Is a play by William M.
    Hoffman. Directed by Marshall W. Mason and co-produced by The Circle
    Repertory Company and The Glines production company. The show opened on
    March 10, 1985, at the Circle Theatre, where it ran for 49 performances. The
    cast included Jonathan Hadary, Jonathan Hogan, Lou Liberatore, Ken Kliban
    and Claris Erickson. As Is portrays the effect that HIV, a relatively new
    epidemic in the 1980s, has on a group of friends living in New York City.
    The scene Kenny Burgess portrays is of a nude reclining sex worker.This play
    depicts a gay couple, Saul and Rich, who open the play with their
    relationship separation. Rich's decision to separate is reversed when he
    returns to Saul after contracting AIDS from his new lover. Seeking emotional
    support, Rich shows how people with AIDS were treated by the American
    family, doctors and friends. Their impersonal and detached attitudes lead
    Rich to recognize the importance of a partner for the gay individual.

    Foundation.This pair of drawings are two studies for Harter's artwork Pete
    Asleep.John Burton Harter documented the richness of gay experience through
    his artwork. Harter is most known for male figure studies and compositions
    of the male body. These works range from classical studio drawings to
    completed paintings and self-portraits. Many convey camaraderie and
    affection and are filled with joy. Harter participated in the AIDS
    discourse, leading to his creation of the AIDS Wall. Executed from
    1992-2001, the AIDS Wall is a tribute to friends and people he admired who
    died from AIDS-related complications or who were living with HIV.Born in
    Jackson, Mississippi, Harter grew up in Louisville, Kentucky. Interested in
    anthropology, archaeology, and the arts, he was educated at the University
    of Louisville, BA Art History, 1963 and Louisiana State University, MA,
    Painting, 1970. Harter worked at the Louisiana State Museum in the late
    1960s and gained a reputation for his attention to detail in caring for fine
    art. The museum promoted him to curator and then collections manager,
    overseeing all holdings. Meanwhile, Harter produced paintings and drawings
    that often reflected his explorations as a gay man. He credited Paul Cadmus
    (1904-1999) for establishing an artistic climate that motivated him to
    explore the male nude and relationships between men openly in art. He died
    in an unsolved murder at his home in New Orleans.Recent exhibitions of his
    work include The Messenger: John Burton Harter & R. E. Roberts, SPRING/BREAK
    Art Show, Los Angeles, CA, 2022 and his work was included in Art after
    Stonewall, 1969-1989, Leslie-Lohman Museum, New York, NY, 2019. His artwork

    1995.Provenance: Estate of the artist to benefit The John Burton Harter
    Foundation.John B. Harter focused his artistic practice on the male body. He
    worked from photographs, first shooting his models then creating fully
    formed compositions based on these images. Often they depict his friends and
    acquaintances, he even photographed himself as a model.  In addition to his
    artwork, he worked as a curator for many years before dedicating himself to
    his studio practice. He stated: "The development of my art has paralleled my
    homoerotic exploration and as I discovered aspects of the gay world, I
    incorporated them into my paintings and drawings. My translation of the gay
    world to imagery, to art, defined what I was learning to myself, and each –
    art and lifestyle – became a part of the other."

    series. Ink and marker on paper with glaze. 406x289 mm; 16x11½ inches.
    Signed "©John Blackburn" and "Jay Blackburn" lower margin. 1989. Provenance:
    Private collection, Los Angeles, California.John Blackburn was born in
    Statesboro, Georgia in 1939. He attended art school in Nashville, Tennessee.
    After graduation, he settled in Atlanta but relocated to Los Angeles in the
    1960s where his career flourished. There he drew illustrations for such
    publications as Physique Pictorial, Physique Art Quarterly, One, In Touch,
    FirstHand, ManTalk, Manscape, and Guys magazines. During the late 70's,
    Blackburn created the character of Coley Cochran, a 19-year-old bisexual who
    is kidnapped and undergoes a rite which turns him into a Dorian Gray-like
    ageless "voodoo sex god," narcissistic and able to seduce anyone. The artist
    incorporated his own experiences and memories of being a young gay man in
    the south during the '60s and '70s into Coley's character and narrative. He
    self-published four volumes of the popular series between 1989-1991.

    his day. Chelsea Boys was carried first by Next magazine, and then
    syndicated throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain,
    and South Africa. Its acclaim led to two book anthologies (Chelsea Boys.
    Alyson Books, 2003; Chelsea Boys Steppin' Out. Bruno Gmunder, 2006) and an
    exclusive art show (Chelsea Boys: Hung) at the Leslie-Lohman Museum in

  TYPESET: >-

    lower right. Circa 2001.Provenance: Acquired directly from the artist by the
    current owner, private collection, New York.In Scarlet Letter, Paul Marcus
    examines Nathaniel Hawthorne's famed novel The Scarlet Letter and applies a
    queer recontextualization of the text. The unalienable right to love between
    Hester Prynne and Arthur Dimmesdale is alternative to a queer couple's right
    to marry and love of one another. The figure's puritan drag and the bundle
    of holly lend a hand to the revisionist grasp of Harthorne's text. Marcus
    dons Prynne's scarlett letter but uses the greek letter for lambda now known
    as the symbol for the 1970s gay liberation movement. The pink triangle
    behind the lambda initially intended as a badge of shame by Nazi Germany,
    later reclaimed as a positive symbol of self-identity during the 1970s as a
    popular symbol of LGBTQ pride.Painter and printmaker Paul Marcus focuses his
    social justice-based practice on the subjects of HIV, war, discrimination,
    and poverty.  He studied at the Cooper Union and attained a BFA from Cooper
    Union in 1976 and an MFA from the University of Buffalo in 1978. In 1990, he
    collaborated with David Wojnarowicz (1954 - 1992) on an exhibition examining
    the current state of the AIDS crisis at their gallery P.P.O.W. Solo
    exhibitions have included Horsplay, University of Buffalo Art Galleries,
    University of Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, 2011; Paul Marcus: The Bush Years,
    ACA Galleries, New York, 2008; A Critical Reality: Works by Sue Coe and Paul
    Marcus, ACA Galleries, New York, 1997. He has artworks in the collections of
    The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the National

    John Bankston received his BFA from the University of Chicago and his MFA in
    painting from the School of the Art Institute in Chicago. Bankston is known
    for his signature coloring book style format where he employs playful

    with the use of traditional macho accessories juxtaposed with flamboyant
    headpieces and clothing. Bankston takes the notions of “drag” and
    “impersonation” to a new level in order to get to the root of important
    human traits such as trust, admiration, and love.John Bankston's work has
    been exhibited at The Studio Museum in Harlem, The Andy Warhol Museum,
    Pittsburgh, The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, The Contemporary Art
    Museum Houston, and Wexner Center for the Arts. Bankston is the recipient of

  DESCRIPT: JAMES GOBEL (1972 - )
  CROSSHEAD: Before Paramount.
  TYPESET: >-
    Felt, yarn and acrylic paint on canvas mounted on board, 2004. 711x609 mm;
    28x24 inches. Signed, titled and dated in ink, verso.Provenance: acquired
    from Kravets Wehby Gallery with gallery label, verso, private collection, NY
    (2005).Exhibited: Ridicule is Nothing to Be Scared of, Kravets Wehby
    Gallery, New York, 2005.Ridicule is Nothing to Be Scared of is an excellent
    example of James Gobel's felt artworks that he began making in the 1990s. He
    first draws his figures in pencil and then in yarn, and then creates a
    mosaic of felt pieces. The use of felt emits drama and solicits empathy for
    its character from the viewer. Inspired by the Bear community and
    Edwardianism, Gobel channels Aubrey Beardsley, Peter Max, and 1980s New Wave
    imagery. He uses the ideologies of feminist and queer theories to forge a
    vignette of a zaftig gay man. Gobel's foreshadows issues of gender and
    physicality while emoting while constructing a language outside of a
    perceived societal norm.Born in 1972 in Portland, Oregon, James Gobel
    received his BFA at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, 1996 and his MFA at
    the University of California, Santa Barbara, 1999. He had a solo exhibition
    at the UCLA Hammer Museum in 2000 and has been included in group exhibitions
    at the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art, Des Moines Art Center, Asian Art Museum
    San Francisco, Akron Art Museum, Parrish Art Museum and the New Museum in
    New York. Gobel is a professor in the Painting and Drawing Program at
    California College of the Arts.

    Sepuya was issued in Studio Work (Familiar), 2012 after he completed after
    finishing the Artist-in-Residence program at The Studio Museum in Harlem.
    The artist writes about his works: “I am exploring how the studio
    environment, as the site of creation, editing, and accumulation affects and
    frames portraiture, and the performance of portraiture.”Born in San
    Bernardino, California, Paul Mpafi Sepuya received his BFA from New York
    University’s Tisch School of the Arts in 2004 and his MFA from the
    University of California, Los Angeles 2016. Known as a postmodern portrait

    fragmentation and connection.His work has been included in group exhibitions

  DESCRIPT: ANDREW LAMAR HOPKINS (1977 - )
  CROSSHEAD: 'The New Orleans Home of two Confirmed Bachelors #2.'
  TYPESET: >-
    Acrylic on canvas board, 2014. 347x457 mm; 13⅝x18 inches. Signed and dated
    in ink, lower left. Signed, titled and dated in ink, verso.Provenance:
    commissioned by the owner, private collection, New York.Poised in the
    painting are two elegant bachelors seated in a 19th-century sitting room
    basking in daytime attire amongst the fine and decorative arts of the
    period. Andrew LeMar Hopkins has created a fictionalized scene, not of
    continental France but Creole New Orleans. Inspired by a research-based
    practice, he has constructed a world where two men could be confirmed
    bachelors or more. Incorporating architectural elements of 18th century
    French Quarter and designs from antiquity, Hopkins weaves together a
    neo-classical world that subtly alludes to the their queer life
    together.Experienced as a professional antiquarian, Hopkins is a self-taught
    artist born in Mobile, Alabama. Currently living and working in New Orleans,
    Andrew LeMar Hopkins creates historical fantasies of Creole people in the
    19th century. Through research, exploration and his imagination, he creates
    maximalist paintings that are detailed with every possible aspect of Creole
    life. Working in a continuum, he explores the past while tweaking it to
    involve the viewer in intimate vignettes, injecting overtly homosocial
    scenarios or overt references to queer culture. He uses his identity as a
    Black, queer man living in New Orleans to revisit, recontextualize, and
    bring histories that have been lost to us. In Addition, his parallel
    practice is as a drag queen; his alter ego, Désirée Joséphine Duplantier, is
    a grande dame empress from New Orleans.

    Bridgwood attended The Art Institute of Boston from 1978-81 and the School
    of Visual Arts, NY from 1981-83. He emerged from school just as the
    short-lived art scene of Manhattan's East Village was in its boon. This was
    a vibrant time with youth culture vying for attention in the galleries,
    clubs and graffiti decorated walls of the city. Though much of the art in
    New York during the 1980s was socially charged realism, Bridgwood chose
    abstraction as his means of expression.
