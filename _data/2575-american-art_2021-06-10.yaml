    San Francisco (<i>Ano 1719—Armir</i> with the label); private collection,
    Florida.<br><br>Carlsen (1848-1932) used drawing to record color
    information, draw contours for transfer to a painting or as a pre-sketch
    before inking.  Most of his drawings were destroyed once used to transfer to
    the canvas, so very few have survived. <i>Study of a House</i> possibly
    portrays William Merritt Chases' homestead in Shinnecock, New York; he often
    stayed with Chase (1849-1916) from around 1876 until he met Julian Alden
    Weir (1852-1919) and spent time at Weir's home in Connecticut. The house is
    found in other works by Carlsen. The figural study verso is a grid drawing
    with contour for transfer or enlargement, and is similar to those he made
    around 1896-97 after studying in Paris with Antoine Vollon, which were
    similar to the French artist's in style.  The other drawing, <i>Ano 1719
    Arm's Jr.</i>, likely represents a bar or tavern in Boston, or possibly,
    England.

    several prominent women associated with the artistic life of Cincinnati at
    the turn of the century, Sykes (1855-1931) specialized in colorful,
    Impressionist-inspired watercolors.   She was born in Brookline,
    Massachusetts; her father was a silversmith and engraver, and her mother was
    a gifted needleworker.  Stimulated by the artistic example of her parents,
    Sykes studied at the Lowell Institute in Boston in 1875 and enrolled at the
    school of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1878.  She married in 1882and moved
    with her husband to Cincinnati, at that time a flourishing cultural center
    dubbed the "Queen City of the West."  In order to refine her artistic
    skills, she enrolled at the Cincinnati Art Academy in 1884.  Throughout the
    next decade, she continued her training under such notable American painters
    as Frank Duveneck and Thomas Satterwhite Noble.  Although she occasionally
    worked in oil, watercolor became Sykes' favorite medium of
    expression.<br><br>She was a regular contributor to the annual exhibitions
    of the Boston Art Club, New York Watercolor Club, Art Institute of Chicago,
    the Philadelphia Water Color Club and the Ohio Water Color Society.  In
    1892, she became a charter member of the Woman's Art Club of Cincinnati. 
    Over a three-decade-long period, Sykes exhibited at the Cincinnati Art
    Museum on forty-two occasions.

    Europe, where he painted society portraits of the upper class.  When he
    returned to the United States, he continued to build his career painting
    portraits of prominent society members.  This bold study of a nude model,
    with a silk robe over her left shoulder, while not unusual in his
    <i>ouevre</i>, was an infrequent subject for Betts, it is also among the
    largest nude studies by the artist to be offered at auction.

    Eberle (1878-1942) in 1907, this bronze was cast in 1911 and stands out
    among the artist's most important Ashcan School works.<br><br>Eberle
    (1878-1942) was known for her politically and socially conscious small-scale
    bronze sculptures that depicted the poor residents of New York's Lower East
    Side.  She was born in Webster City, Iowa and was raised in Canton, Ohio. 
    She began teaching herself by copying tombstones and memorials before
    studying at the Arts Students League, New York.  In 1907, she began
    composing sculptures in a social realist manner and was associated with the
    Ashcan School, which also included artists Robert Henri, John Sloan and
    George Luks, and photographers such as Jacob Riis and Lewis Hine, all of
    whom rebelled against American Impressionism and academic realism popular in
    the art market at the time.  Many artists associated with the Ashcan School
    exhibited at the Macbeth Gallery, New York; Eberle showed there from
    1907-13.  In 1913, she exhibited two works at the Armory Show, one titled
    <i>White Slave</i> that depicted a child prostitute (child prostitution was
    then euphemistically reffered to as white slavery).  The shocking
    combination of contemporary realism, with a man peddling the youth by his
    side, and her blatant nudity caused considerable controversy.  Overall,
    Eberle believed art should have a social function and that the artist has,
    "No right to work as an individualist with no responsibility to others."

    Julian and Académie Colarossi.  He spent summers near Damariscotta, Maine,
    which was often the inspiration for his work. The years of 1932-42 are
    considered his most innovative period and the last years during which he
    painted in oil, using brilliant colors and switching between the brush and
    the palette knife.  His subject matter focused mainly on small towns and
    landscape during the Great Depression, evincing hints of the struggle of its
    inhabitants despite the overall compositions appearing peaceful.

    photographs; his <i>George Platt Lynes: Photographs 1931-1955</i>, 1981,
    with an introductory text by Kirstein, is a photography book icon; private
    collection, New Mexico.<br><br>Tooker (1920-2011) was born in Brooklyn and,
    after graduating from Harvard University with an English degree in 1942 and
    enlisting in the Officer Candidates School, United States Marine Corps (he
    was discharged for medical reasons), studied at the Art Students League, New
    York, from 1943 to 1945 under the artists Reginald Marsh and Kenenth Hayes
    Miller.  Tooker met Paul Cadmus at the Art Students League and through
    Cadmus was introduced to Jared and Margaret French, all of whom would work
    together, collaborate and become lifelong friends in the ensuing decades. 
    Through his connection with Cadmus and French, Tooker also became closely
    acquainted with Monroe Wheeler and Lincoln Kirstein, both of whom had strong
    ties to the nascent Museum of Modern Art, New York.<br><br>In 1946, in large
    part due to Kirstein's influence, Tooker was included in the groundbreaking
    exhibition "Fourteen Americans" curated by Dorothy Miller, at The Museum of
    Modern Art, which was a significant success in his early career.  Three
    years later, following a half year of travel through Italy and France,
    studying old masters and architecture with Cadmus, Tooker participated in
    the exhibition "Symbolic Realism," 1949-50, organized by Kirstein, which
    brought him further recognition; the same year <i>The Subway</i>, egg
    tempera on panel, 1950, was acquired by the Whitney Museum of American Art,
    New York, his first painting to enter a museum collection.  He had his first
    solo exhibition the following year at the Edwin Hewitt Gallery, New
    York.<br><br>Like Cadmus and French, Tooker was categorized by art critics
    as a "Magic Realist," though he resisted this label.  He said of his work,
    "I am after painting reality impressed on the mind so hard that it returns
    as a dream, but I am not after painting dreams as such, or fantasy." 
    Describing his process, he noted, "I don't really think I'm a creator.  I
    feel that I'm a passive vessel, a receptor or translator . . . The
    fascinating thing about painting is the discovery."  Tooker's work gradually
    fell out of the spotlight with the ascent of Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art
    and Minimalism in the decades following the 1950s, though he continued to
    paint in the assiduous style he had developed during his early
    career.<br><br>The death of his partner, the artist and activist William R.
    Christopher, in 1973, prompted his conversion to Catholicism and a deeper
    spirituality in his work thereafter.  Tooker's work was rediscovered during
    the 1980s and his appeal widened starting with his representation by DC
    Moore Gallery, New York, in the late 1990s and the exhibition "George
    Tooker: A Retrospective," at the National Academy Museum, New York;
    Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia; and Columbus Museum of
    Art, Ohio, in 2008-09.  He spent the last decades of his career focusing on
    his art and spiritual life in relative solitude at his home in rural
    Vermont.  Tooker received the prestigious National Medal of Arts in 2007; he
    died at home in April 2011.<br><br>Although Tooker had begun to experiment
    with egg tempera early in his career through Marsh at the Art Students
    League, it was both Cadmus and French who encouraged him to adopt it as his
    primary medium.  The technique had close ties to Renaissance painting, which
    all three artists emulated, and was the primary panel painting medium for
    nearly every painter in the European Medieval and Early Renaissance period
    up to 1500.  Tempera is a quick-drying, tedious and unforgiving method of
    painting that is hard to change after being applied.  This deliberate method
    suited Tooker's disposition and artistic theory.  He spent several
    intensely-focused hours each day, most days a week, for roughly four months
    fine-tuning each piece, slowly and deliberately building up color and
    dimension.  He mixed his colors by hand, using water, egg yolk and powdered
    pigment.<br><br>Tooker's images convey a sense of overwhelming silence, as
    in the current painting, and the figures he depicts are rarely overcome by
    emotion and seldom convey individuality.  Although in this work, the
    features of the male, with the large, dark eyes, prominent brown, round
    face, full lips and close-cropped hair bear a striking resemblance to Tooker
    in his twenties, and the style of the dress worn by the woman is one
    frequently modeled by Magaret French in numerous 1940s/1950s PaJaMa
    photographs (the moniker "PaJaMa" is a portmanteau of the first two letters
    of Paul, Jared and Margaret which the three artists used to reflect a fluid
    and collective mode of authorship in their photography).  Tooker's work is
    grounded with a precise geometric architecture, which is both a gesture to
    the ubiquitous use of perspective in Renaissance art and a recognition of
    the order and rigidty of modern architecture.  In the current work, the
    scaffold, playground-like frame is similar to one seen in PaJaMa photographs
    from the 1940s and 1950s, on which Cadmus and Jared and Margaret French
    often posed for photographs, on the beach at Fire Island, New York.

    and the artist's great-niece, Council Bluffs, Iowa; private collection,

    owners, Grell (1887-1960) was sent to Germany to study and trained at School
    of Applied Arts in Hamburg and at the Royal Academie of Fine Arts in Munich,
    under Franz von Struck (1908-12).  When America's involvement in World War I
    became certain, Grell was forced to escape Europe in 1914 through Norway and
    landed his first American artistic position as a stage set designer for
    large Broadway productions in New York in 1915.<br><br>During the late
    1910s, Grell made his way back to the Midwest and settled in Chicago, where
    he became the main art instructor at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts
    (1916-22) where one of his students was animator and cartoonist, Walt Disney
    (1901-1966).  By the early 1930s, Grell had embarked on a solo career as a
    portrait and mural painter.  He became among the most prominent muralists of
    the Hollywood Golden Age, with a regular clientele list that included old

    earth itself." While at Wittenberg, he channeled most of his creativity into
    stage sets and became interested in experimental film.  He wrote to Hilla
    Rebay (1890-1967), director of the Museum of Non-Objective Painting (now the
    Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum), which led to him moving to New York to work
    at the museum while also furthering his own artistic practice, which
    included experimental filmmaking as well as painting.

    his New York apartment, isolating himself from news and current events,
    absorbing the energy and chaos of the city during infrequent outings.  He
    eschewed Abstract Expressionism and rejected trends of Minimalism and Pop
    Art and produced lively, surreal figurative work in line with the visions of
    Jean Dubuffet and Paul Klee.  Early in his career, his work was featured in
    an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, "Recent Drawings,"
    April 25-August 5, 1956, and in addition to The MoMA, his works can be now
    found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Brooklyn Museum, New
    York;  Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven; Carnegie Museum of Art,
    Pittsburgh, and the Collection de l’Art Brut in Lausanne, Switzerland.

    original label; private collection, Massachusetts.<br><br>Gurr (1897-1992)
    was born in Brooklyn.  She studied art at the Educational Alliance Art
    School and was awarded a scholarship to The Art Students League, New York,
    where she studied with John Sloan (1871-1951).  Gurr had a prolific career
    in which she painted landscape scenes and still lifes, but her most noted
    works were the everyday city scenes that were laced with social commentary. 
    She often painted in a semi-Cubist style, but always also tried to capture a
    sense of humanity within abstraction.

    trained to become a Jazz musician, but in the late 1940s, after being
    exposed to Cubism and studying with Hans Hofmann for two years, redirected
    himself toward the fine arts.  In 1950, he met the poet Frank O'Hara,
    beginning a lifelong association with various literary figures (Jack Kerouac
    and Allen Ginsberg among them), and had his first one-man exhibition at the
    Tibor de Nagy Gallery, New York.<br><br>Rivers's early work reveals foremost
    Abstract Expressionist tendencies, albeit with the appropriation of various
    everyday objects that both influenced and brought him closer to the Pop art
    movement.  His artistic style was perhaps best summed up by Andy Warhol, who
    mused, "Larry's painting style was unique--it wasn't Abstract Expressionism
    and it wasn't Pop, it fell into the period in between.  But his personality
    was very Pop."

    Hans Hoffmann before moving to New York and immersing herself in the Second
    Generation of New York School abstract expressionist painters.  She was the
    youngest member of the American Abstract Artists group in 1944.  Later in
    her career she was drawn towards working in a more representational style,
    blending it with her dynamic brushwork reminiscent of her earlier Abstract
    Expressionist paintings.<br><br>In the 1950s, she met Dilys Evans, a nurse
    who helped Blaine recouperate from polio complications at Mount Sinai
    Hostpital, New York.  Blaine has noted that Evans brought her paint and
    canvas to the hospital while she was recovering from polio so she could
    produce art. They eventually become lovers, and together they traveled
    extensively, including to the UK, St. Lucia, and Gloucester, among other
    locations.
