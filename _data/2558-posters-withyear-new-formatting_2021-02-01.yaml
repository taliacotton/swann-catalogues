    Beardsley designed this image as a stock poster, leaving the entire right
    side available for the printer's text. "The most striking thing about
    Beardsley's work, and the source of its immediate fame, is the intense,
    erotic (or better, narcissistic) atmosphere it exudes. Once the shock of
    recognition passes, it can be seen that Beardsley was an incredibly assured
    draughtsman and a perversely inventive designer" (Word & Image p. 18). This
    elegant, reclining woman with a low-cut dress (made more modest with a
    brooch) is certainly an unexpected image to see promoting the sale of
    children's books. In <I>La Plume's</i> 1899 <I>Album d'Affiches et
    d'Estampes</i>, only the image was offered for sale. It is <i>rare</i> to
    find the complete poster with the text. DFP-I 5, Reims 1348, The Poster no.

    Leonard Smithers, a libertine, book dealer and publisher of erotica, founded
    the magazine <I>Savoy</i> in 1896. For his principle illustrator, he
    employed Beardsley, who had recently lost his position at the <I>Yellow
    Book</i> due to intense criticism of his mores. In Victorian England, such a
    publication did not last long - only 8 issues were published. Beardsley
    designed all the covers and numerous illustrations for the articles, as well
    as some stories himself. This image, referred to by Beardsley as a
    'posterette,' was his design for the cover of the last issue, and after the
    magazine's demise, it became the cover for the complete three-volume set of
    <I>Savoy</i>.

    Various characters populate this poster promoting a series of books
    published in England and Boston. Beardsley, "with his erotic grotesquery,
    his tuberculous capacity for a fine, punctilious decadence . . . ushered out
    the century in a sensuous shiver" (Rickards p. 36). "He so far despised the
    society that suffered him that he allowed his mockery to invade his work;
    more often than not his assignments in illustration and decoration carried
    him off in flights of irrelevant rudery; he was compulsive, abstruse, and
    rapturously sick" (ibid). DFP-I 11, Maitres 1900 p. 105, Weill 103, Metzl p.

    York City, (created while part of the Ashcan School), led to his
    considerable fame. "His posters display a firm control of graphic design
    that continued throughout his extensive career as an etcher in the new

  at-a-glance: '107½x47 inches, 273x120½ cm. J. Blasnika, Ljubljana.'
  TYPESET: >-
    The Sokol movement was founded in 1862 (in what is now the Czech Republic)
    on the principle that physical fitness was an important part of a person's
    well-being. Sokol members would gather every four years at massive Slets
    (assemblies) to perform physical drills and gymnastics to which the public
    was always invited. Aside from exercise, the Sokol movement was also a
    hotbed for nationalist development; the movement spread across Moravia and
    Slovenia, where the first Sokol event was held in 1863, and eventually
    spread across the Austro-Hungarian empire to encompass events in the
    Croatian and Serbian territories as well. This poster promotes the third
    Slovenian Sokol Slet, in Ljubljana. As Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated
    barely two months before this exhibition was supposed to take place, and war
    declared in July 1914, it is unclear whether or not the event occurred. The
    wonderfully-colored and archly Art Nouveau image depicts a young athlete in
    his physical prime, standing in a field full of flowers, surrounded by
    falcons (which is the literal translation of Sokol), with the Ljubljana
    Castle in the distance. Note the impressive floral ornamentation and the two
    Sokol logos in the bottom corners of the design. <i>Rare.</i>

  TYPESET: >-
    This is one of Mangold's earliest posters (his first was printed in 1902).
    In his formative years, Mangold's work reflected the influence of Hans
    Sandreuter. A Swiss painter (who also designed several posters),
    Sandreuter's work was inspired by Greek mythology and his images are filled
    with allegorical figures in classical poses. To announce this upcoming Song
    Festival, Mangold combines Secessionist design elements and mythology.
    Arion, the Greek poet who was saved by a dolphin, is depicted in Lake
    Constance swimming toward Zurich. Soon after this poster was designed,
    Mangold began working with the inimitable Swiss printing house of
    Wolfensberger. He quickly abandoned his symbolic approach and naturalist
    renderings, began using flat colors, and became one of the pioneers of the
    modern Swiss poster art. Mangold 42, Swiss Art Nouveau 80.

    publishing company in 1889, designing sheet music covers for operas. Shortly
    thereafter, he became art director of the firm and began to design posters.
    Poster artists such as Dudovich, Mauzan and Metlicovitz worked under
    Hohenstein, and their posters reflect his influence as one of the masters of
    the Golden Age of Italian posters, "from obvious stylistic floral influences
    of French Art Nouveau and the German Jugendstil" (Manifesti Italiano, p.
    114). Hohenstein was invited to work outside of Italy, in France as well as
    Belgium, where he designed at least two posters printed by the Belgian
    printing house J.L. Goffart. The Liberty Style at the turn of the century
    was triumphant in Italy, while the fascination for posters had begun to wane
    in France. Here, he advertises the innovations of Félix Marmonier, a famed
    inventor who created wine presses and equipment in the American style.

    <I>L'Estampe et l'Affiche</i> was a magazine devoted to prints and posters;
    during the two years of it's publishing run, it was a mainstay of the print
    and poster collecting community. Bonnard's image, using only three colors,
    is a charming allegory of the life and spirit imbued in collecting prints.
    It shows a young collector coming home in such a hurried and excited state
    that some prints are actually falling out of her huge portfolio. An older
    woman, who represents a different generation of collectors who do not
    understand all the rage surrounding paper, bemusedly observes her process.
    The freely-drawn typography literally invades the image, with prominence of
    placement and the bold white color of the paper given to the word "Affiche."

    Chéret is unanimously considered to be the father of the poster. His first
    recorded attempt at poster art was in 1858 for Offenbach's <I>Orfée aux
    Enfers</i>. By present day standards, the result was a dark, messy poster
    with clumsy color usage, but in its day it was a revolution. Over the next
    thirty years Chéret perfected the technique of mixing colors, and
    simplifying his layouts. He also may be the first artist to ever use
    sexuality to sell products; in most of his posters he would depict
    beautiful, care-free, irresistible and jubilant women. They became so
    popular with the French public, that they were referred to as Chérettes. In
    1889, with this poster for the opening of the Moulin Rouge, Chéret (at the
    age of 53) reached his stylistic maturity. With three decades of experience
    in the field, he had resolved and refined all color and composition issues
    and emerged as a truly outstanding talent who created masterpiece upon
    masterpiece. For the next decade, he produced some of the most vivid and
    colorful posters ever seen, and was an inspiration to a whole generation of
    artists, advertisers and consumers. This poster contains all of the life and
    spirit that were a hallmark of his work. In the foreground, a Chérette sits
    on a donkey;  behind her is the landmark red windmill, after which the
    concert hall was named, as well as charming girls in gray and black, also on
    donkeys; the figures are positioned throughout the image as if whirling in
    the windmill's blades. Maindron 253, Cheret 395, Broido 309, DFP-II, 181,

  TYPESET: >-
    Capitalizing on the poster craze sweeping through France during the
    fin-de-siecle, publishers began to issue large-format decorative panels
    designed by the best poster artists. Grasset's panels began in small format
    with two plates for <I>L'Estampe Originale</i>. By 1896, he was working on a
    series of ten full-size panels (<I>Estampes Decoratives</i>) for his
    printer, Malherbe. In these panels, Grasset used representations of women
    and nature to express states of mind and moods. The influence of Japanese
    prints is clear, including the use of flat colors and broad outlining.
    Unlike Mucha's sensual approach, Grasset depicted his women in their static
    poses, resulting in a fascinating, hypnotizing effect. <I>Meditation</i> is
    arguably Grasset's best panel, as the image of a woman lost in her thoughts
    in the silence of nature so perfectly reflects Grasset's style. The series
    was acclaimed in 1897 at the <I>Libre Esthetique</i> in Brussels and then at
    the first <I>Secession Exhibition</i> in Vienna. <i>Rare.</i> This is the

    the cabaret, artists such as Renoir, van Gogh, and Pissarro have

    Mucha breathed so much more life into it that this became one of the best
    selling sets of decorative panels" (Rennert / Weill p. 90). "Mucha's style
    of [this] time was characterized by brooding, melancholic figures, strong
    theatrical poses, and flowing robes that at the same time hide and reveal
    beautiful female bodies whose figures are outlined by bold decorative line"
    (Spirit of Art Nouveau p. 184). They were printed in many different

  TYPESET: >-
    The production of <I>Medee</i> advertised here was a contemporary adaptation
    of a play originally written by Euripides. A classic, violent Greek tragedy
    about the warrior Jason, the play begins when he returns home from his quest
    for the Golden Fleece, bringing with him Medea. When he falls in love with
    another woman, Medea, "driven by a pagan code of honor and her own dark
    passions . . . conceives a terrible vengeance of gothic cruelty: she kills
    Jason's father, her own two children, and his new mistress, so that he would
    have to go through life deprived of everything he loved" (Rennert / Weill p.
    208). The somber and tragic image depicts a glimpse of the slaughter, with
    Medea, a mad look in her eyes, standing with a bloody dagger over one of her
    victims. "Mucha's exquisite design uses Medea's arm and the dagger as a
    giant exclamation point, emphasized by the look of stark horror on her face
    as she exacts her gothic revenge. It is one of [Mucha's] most powerful
    posters" (Lendl p. 53). "It carries all the signs of Mucha's masterpieces in
    composition and color as well as the decorative certainty with which he left
    the bottom two-thirds of the background white" (Spirit of Art Nouveau p.
    151). The composition is organized vertically with Mucha's trademark "halo"
    behind the actress' head, and lettering designed in the style of mosaic to
    evoke the story's origin in ancient Greece. Sarah Bernhardt was so enamored
    with the snake bracelet that Mucha depicted adorning her arm that she
    actually had one made by Fouquet for her to wear. Rennert / Weill 53, DFP-II

  TYPESET: >-
    Leslie Carter was an extravagant woman and aspiring actress whose incredible
    success was largely attributed to her charms and the shrewd way in which she
    applied them to her pursuits. Both Mucha and the author of the play promoted
    by this poster, <I>Kassa</i>, (a commercial disappointment, despite the
    wonderful poster) were both so taken with her that they completed their work
    without compensation. For this poster, one of the few that Mucha designed
    while living in America from 1904-1912, the artist is clearly harkening back
    to his poster designs for Sarah Bernhardt from earlier in his career, as the
    tall format of the poster, the drape of the gown, the halo behind the
    actress' head and the crown of flowers are all reminiscent of his work in
    the late 1890s. Mucha had clearly lost nothing of his ability to design a
    great theater poster (although one cannot help questioning the choice of
    blue-green for the actress' skin tone). Curiously, the title of the
    production itself, appears nowhere on the image. The poster, printed by
    Strobridge, is signed "from a design by Mucha;" most likely had the artist
    been on the press, he would have corrected this detail. Rennert / Weill 94,

    there were 100 images. However, as the name implies, these were not posters
    but prints, designed by many of the popular artists of the day. The
    technical and editorial team responsible for publishing the works was among
    the best of its day: the printer was Champenois, and the directors were
    Charles Piazza (who published Mucha's <I>Ilsée</i> and <I>Le Pater</i>), and
    Charles Masson, the director of the Musée du Luxembourg. The print run was
    limited to 2000 copies, with an additional 100 printed on Japan paper.

  TYPESET: >-
    Orazi was born in Rome, received his artistic training at the famed Italian
    printing house of Ricordi, and then moved to Paris where he achieved instant
    success by participating in the second exhibition at Siegfried Bing's
    gallery L'Art Nouveau, for which he designed <I>Le Calendrier
    Fantastique</i>. His work "explores and crosses the influences of Byzantium,
    Antiquity, symbolism and occultism" (Art Nouveau p. 121). Orazi went on to
    design this, one of his most famous posters for Bing's competitor, Julius
    Meyer-Graefe, who opened up La Maison Moderne in 1898. Meyer-Graefe had
    spent time with the avant-garde artistic community in Berlin (he had helped
    establish the influential magazine <I>Pan</i>) before he came to Paris and
    opened up his store dedicated to Art Nouveau finery of the day, including
    pottery, glass, lamps and jewelry. He employed top notch designers like Van
    de Velde to help him with his merchandise and called on some top poster
    designers, like Orazi and Maurice Biais, to create devise his advertising.
    This image highlights not only the extreme elegance of the women who
    frequented the store, but specifically draws attention to many of the fine
    items that were for sale, including the furniture, jewelry and bibelots.
    Bertrand Mothes, in his paper, "La Maison Moderne de Julius Meyer-Graefe"
    helps us identify these objects: "an inkwell bearing a bronze figure of
    Alexander Carpenter on a base designed by [Maurice] Dufrêne and made of
    flamed sandstone by Adrien Dalpayrat, an armchair by Van de Velde, a bronze
    lamp by Gustave Gurschner, a vase by Dufrêne and Dalpayrat and a monkey
    figurine by Joseph Mendes da Costa." Perhaps more importantly, Mothes
    identifies the glamourous and impeccably coiffed and outfitted patron as
    "the famous dancer Cléo de Mérode, who, like a muse, lends her image to the
    gallery"
    (http://hicsa.univ-paris1.fr/documents/file/4-Mothes-Maison%20moderne.pdf,
    p. 17).  Note that Orazi also incorporates the store's stylized "MM" logo,
    designed by Georges Lemmen. In addition to this <i>rare</i> and important
    poster, Orazi himself designed some items to be sold in the store. DFP-II

    René Péan was a student and close follower of Chéret. They worked together
    at the Chaix printing firm and many of Péan's early posters bear a striking
    resemblance to Chéret's work in drawing style, coloring and even lettering.
    Péan created posters for varied clients, ranging from cabarets and theaters
    to tourism and department stores. He designed a number of posters for travel
    from Paris to London which incorporated both the French Railway and the
    London, Brighton & South Coast Railway.

    The French Automobile Club was founded in 1895 and organized their first
    exhibition in 1898. After the 1900 World's Fair had ended and the
    prestigious Grand Palais became available for major events, the <I>Auto
    Show</i> relocated there and grew in both prominence and size. It was held
    in the Grand Palais for the next 50 years. In 1902, Livemont was
    commissioned to design the poster advertising the fifth <I>Auto Show</i>.
    The large format image he designed clearly impressed the organizers and the
    public, as he was commissioned to design two more posters for the
    organization: the generic poster for the Automobile Club de France, and then
    one for the <I>Sixth Automobile Show in 1903</i>, this charming image
    featuring one of his archetypical women driving past the magnificent Grand

  TYPESET: >-
    As a painter, van Rysselberghe was best known as a Neo-Impressionist. In
    1883 he was a founding member of the influential art group Les XX (Les
    Vingt, "The Twenty") and he is considered one of the more important Belgian
    painters of the period. When Les XX dissolved in 1893, it transformed into
    another group called La Libre Esthétique, with which van Rysselberghe was
    also very active. "Van Rysselberghe exerted a positive force for the
    revitalization of the decorative arts at the turn of the century, but his
    posters are not numerous; those he created for <I>La Libre Esthétique</i>
    are unquestionably the finest. The elegant female figures of his posters,
    very knowingly placed on the page, seem to be the pretext for van
    Rysselberghe to balance large spots of red-orange against their greenish or
    bluish complementaries. The text is beautifully drawn and gracefully
    integrated into the design of the poster" (Belle Epoque p. 86). He designed
    two posters for the group. Wember 694, Belle Epoque p. 86,  L'Affiche Belge

  TYPESET: >-
    Liane de Pougy was one of the queens of Paris's fin-de-siecle Music Hall
    scene. She and other glamorous and sexy stars such as Caroline Otero,
    Emilienne d'Alencon and Cléo de Mérode were the objects of desire of
    royalty, industrialists and millionaires. Men of rank would fight (often
    using diamonds as weapons) to have the privilege of being seen in the
    company of these women at Maxim's or driving in the Bois de Boulogne. In
    order to keep themselves in the public eye, and keep the public's lascivious
    interest high, these actresses regularly performed in the best music halls.
    Shows were custom-written to highlight their (often limited) talent, and
    <I>Feminissima</i> most certainly fell into that category. In the years
    after the turn-of-the-century, Redon became one of the most prolific poster
    artists working for the Paris music halls. He specialized in sexy,
    suggestive scenes. Here, in what is arguably his best image, he shows the
    star, in all of her sensuous glory, surrounded by roses. Presumably the
    management of the Casino de Paris had a special relationship with the
    censors, as breasts and nipples were otherwise strictly forbidden on
    posters. "The warm and sensuous atmosphere of the poster, and the very
    feminine forms unveiled for the first time in Paris attracted a big crowd
    (probably disappointed by the little freedom authorized on stage!) to the
    Casino" (Folies- Bergere p. 10). Folies-Bergere 51.

    Bernhard Kellermann's enormously popular 1913 novel <I>Der Tunnel</i> was
    published in 1913, translated into 25 languages, and later adapted into
    films. The French publication was put on hold due to World War I, and
    eventually printed in the 1920s. It appeared in serialized form in the pages
    of <I>L'Humanite.</i> Steinlen's intimate and sensitive image shows a young

    With this heartfelt and tender image of a family evicted onto the street to
    advertise the advent of a tenant's association, "Steinlen's posters began
    promoting social causes rather than commercial products" (Cate and Gill p.
    51). A transition between his advertising work and later war images, we can
    still see several familiar themes, such as the cat and the children, which
    make this image "among his most appealing works . . . Steinlen at his
    humanistic best" (Wine Spectator). Whereas Steinlen's images from 1917-18
    are almost all black and white, here we still experience some of his vibrant
    colors. Bargiel 52, Wine Spectator 113.

  TYPESET: >-
    Misia Natanson, the wife of one of the founders of the <I>Revue Blanche</i>,
    was the muse for the artists and writers within this circle. Renowned as a
    brilliant, charming and beautiful woman, she was a source of inspiration for
    Pierre Bonnard, Jacques Villon and Felix Vallotton, among others. Both
    Bonnard and Toulouse-Lautrec were asked to design a poster promoting the
    magazine and they both chose Misia, the living incarnation of the spirit of
    the <I>Revue Blanche</i>, as their subject. Lautrec's image is
    uncharacteristically soft and endearing, representing Misia skating. Some
    people have suggested that Lautrec had fallen in love with her, which would
    explain this rare, tender portrait. The fact that he depicts her without
    showing her legs lends the image a strange, unbalanced feeling, and adds to
    the mystery of the poster. Adriani 130, Delteil 355, Reims 788, Maitres pl.

  TYPESET: >-
    Marcelle Lender (1862-1926) starred in many of the operettas and comic
    operas popular at the end of the 19th century. One of her shows,
    <I>Chilperic</i>, was justifiably unmemorable except that it inspired
    Lautrec to paint a magnificent painting and design six lithographs (Adriani
    110-115). This is by far the best image from that series and the only one in
    color. Lautrec depicts her bowing after an extravagant Spanish dance that
    fascinated him. To render her wild attire and hairdo, he uses eight colors
    with chalk, ink with brush and a spraying/splatter technique. As Adriani
    notes, "no other lithograph is printed with such wealth of subtle color
    combinations and none embodies, as this does, the opulent decoration of an
    age moving towards its close." This is the fourth state of four, from the
    edition of 1211 impressions printed for the Berlin magazine <I>Pan</i>,
    which were inserted in volume I, no. 3 of the periodical. Delteil 102 III,

  at-a-glance: '53x38 inches, 134½x96½ cm. Charles Verneau, Paris.'
  TYPESET: >-
    Bruant was one of Lautrec's earliest supporters. One year after Lautrec
    designed his first poster for the Moulin Rouge, Bruant recognized the
    potential that such potent artwork could have for his own career. He
    "appreciated the sensation it had caused and recognized it as a watershed in
    marketing a personality and the experience of Montmartre" (Montmartre p.
    92). The success of their first work (which Bruant had to force on the
    manager of the Ambassadeurs as he considered it too vulgar) led to many more
    commissions. This is Lautrec's third poster for the performer. It is "his
    sparest design for Bruant, with the performer turning his back to the viewer
    and glancing over his left shoulder, to reveal his face in profile. Now
    reduced to a few elemental shapes, this forceful hieroglyph served as
    Bruant's logo in a variety of formats" (ibid p. 93). The broad strokes, flat
    colors, detailed representation of the singer's face, and the implied
    arrogance of the performer who would turn his back on his public all served
    to make this an iconic image. The poster originally appeared without text;
    when the second edition with text was printed ("Aristide Bruant dans son
    Cabaret,") it was done so by a different printer, Edward Ancourt. Delteil

    of "common necessity." Roubille, a key member of the <I>Salon des

    magazines for whom he contributed rather radical illustrations. His
    signature style, with bright, flat colors and broad outlining is unique and

    races it has won with Garin astride, while his extended arm, politically,
    covers up the recently lost territory of Alsace-Lorraine. Garin's bike is

    Volodimer would not be remembered at all as a poster artist except for the
    images he designed in 1923, 1924 and 1925 for the first three 24-hour
    endurance car races that became known as the legendary "Le Mans." It was
    originally conceived as a three-year event, in which the winner, determined
    by whoever amassed the most miles over the three separate races, would be
    awarded the Rudge-Whitworth Cup. For this first-ever running of the
    prestigious race, the artist provides an exciting night time scene to
    emphasize the 24-hour element of the race. The poster also provides
    information about the other activities included to ensure that this became a
    popular and trendy event, such as fireworks, a jazz band and food organized
    by a Parisian brasserie. A <i>rare</i> document from the history of car
    racing.

    Brussel-Smith, born in Greenwich Village, was first and foremost known as a

    a commercial artist and illustrator for corporations, such as Seagrams, and
    publications, such as <I>Life</i>, <I>The Saturday Evening Post</i>, and
    <I>Time</i>. Among his most well-known commercial works was a series for the
    New York Auto Show in the 1950s and '60s, including this abstract design

  TYPESET: >-
    A <i>rare</i> and monumental poster showcasing the expansive fairgrounds in
    Roubaix, illuminated by a Farman biplane overhead. As a city whose textile
    manufacturing prowess had greatly prospered from the industrial revolution,
    Roubaix was eager to hold a World's Fair in 1911 to help further establish
    its status and reputation in the eyes of the world. Held in the city's
    Barbieux Park from April until November, the exposition contained: palaces
    of decorative art, industry, textiles and machines; pavilions from
    Argentina, Australia, Belgium, New Zealand, Chile and the Netherlands; a
    Colonial section, a Sengalese village, a casino, stadium and restaurants.
    Aviation, still in its infancy, also played a big role in the exposition. A
    small airfield was constructed near the fairgrounds and the first flying
    demonstration there took place on June 4th; on June 12th, assembled aviators
    flew over the city and the exposition grounds. Roubaix was also on the
    five-stage European flying circuit, encompassing a 15-day race through five
    cities - on June 26th the Roubaix-Brussels stage was held. Ironically, a few
    years after this successful event, the First World War broke out, after
    which Roubaix lost its foothold as the economic superpower of Northern
    France. This poster also exists in a smaller, one-sheet format.

    Roger de Valerio was involved in many different aspects of the printing and

    <I>Le Matin</i>, from 1911 to 1914, and <I>Le Rire</i>, in 1932. In 1917, he
    went to work for Salabert, the music publishers, and during his seven-year
    tenure with the company, he designed over 2000 different sheet music covers.
    He also worked as an adviser for the printer Devambez in 1926, and from
    1936, served as Associate Director of Advertising for the publisher
    Perceval. Throughout this busy career, he also found time to produce many
    posters, all of which were executed with an impressive Art Deco flair. This
    poster is one of the great pre-war Art Deco Air France images, in which a
    personification of the airlines rises out of a plane, the round Air France
    logo in her hands echoed by the circles of the propellers and the moon in

  TYPESET: >-
    The appearance of Halley's Comet in 1910 caused quite an uproar around the
    world. The wine distributors Dondena & Sons, in Milan, took advantage of
    Italy's general unease with the cosmic appearance and had Aldo Mazza to
    create an image of a comet in whose tail were the words "mineral water."
    According to that poster, the populace could "save themselves" by drinking
    wine. That same year, Dondena applied for a trademark for their company
    featuring a star enclosed in the letter "D." This poster is a glorious
    allegory of Italian wines, in the figure of a woman emerging from
    grape-ladened vines, wrapped in Italy's tri-color flag and holding aloft the
    company's logo. Mazza began his artistic career as a caricaturist and book
    illustrator. By 1900, he had begun to design posters and worked with a
    variety of different clients to advertise sporting events, the Mele
    department store, and numerous publications and exhibitions. <i>Rare</i>.

  at-a-glance: '61¼x46 inches, 155½x116¾ cm. Alliance Graphique, Paris.'
  TYPESET: >-
    One has to imagine that following the success of his brand mascot for
    Dubonnet, in 1932, Cassandre was emboldened to try another figure filling
    himself with spirits for his next liqueur commission. As the motto for Bonal
    touts it as a cordial that "opens your appetite," Cassandre depicts it,
    quite literally, as a key. The spirit itself appears as a stream of stars
    infusing the body. Alain Weill explains that the background, "never seen
    before, almost kinetic, shows that Cassandre was certainly interested in the
    study of retinal sensations" (Cassandre / Weill p. 126). The poster and
    image were so popular that they were reused in 1935, virtually identical
    except for a different color background. Mouron p. 54, Cassandre / Suntory
    p. 177, Cassandre / Weill 117.

    "In the beginning was the Matterhorn" (Schweiz p. 50). The extraordinary
    contours of this legendary mountain have appeared in countless posters. Many
    Art Nouveau artists depicted the mountain, and their images reflect the
    realistic, academic representations that were popular at the time.
    Cardinaux's image of the dawn-drenched Matterhorn, exceptional and
    revolutionary in its design, smashed the old mold. Pure, bold, simple and
    strong, this poster adapts the style of the German Sachsplakat (Object
    Poster) from before the First World War, and presages the Swiss Realism of
    the early 1920s. "For the first time a graphic approach was taken to the
    problem posed by a poster" (Weill p. 122). "The Swiss poster can be said to
    have been born with the creation of the Zermatt" (ibid). "The poster stands
    out above the common ruck [the typical Swiss poster of the time] just as the
    mountain soars above the landscape" (Schweiz p. 52). It is the first and
    perhaps the finest object poster within the travel poster genre. Cardinaux

  TYPESET: >-
    One of two posters Cardinaux designed for the famous resort hotel; this one
    shows lounging winter guests around a skating rink, while the other, a
    summer scene, depicts golfers. In both, employing casual grace and
    compelling composition, Cardinaux depicts tableaux in his simple, bold
    style. This poster captures a specific attitude, incorporating mood, style
    and fashion, to reflect the lifestyle of the hotel's clientele. It is
    interesting to note the vainglorious manner in which none of the main
    subjects are paying attention to the winter sport happening around them.

    In 1924, the Eighth Olympic games were held in Chamonix. One year later,
    "these successful Games were retrospectively recognized at the
    [International Olympic Committee] Congress in Prague as the first Olympic
    Winter Games" (Olympics p. 35). The decision to hold these winter games came
    in 1921, and "triggered a period of frenzied construction as rail and road
    links and hotel development opened up the area to international tourism"
    (Ibid p. 33). This is one of five official posters for these winter games,
    all of which were published by the PLM Railway, rather than by the Olympic
    Committee. They were all issued with text variants, sometimes promoting the
    Olympic Games and sometimes just promoting winter activities in the area
    itself. A variation of this image exists with the additional text "Sports
    D'Hiver à l'Occasion de la VIIIe Olympiade / 25 Janvier-5 Fevrier 1924."

    Herdeg was a graphic designer who studied under Ernst Keller at the
    Kunstgewerbeschule, Zurich. He served as Art Director for the famed Alpine
    resort of St. Moritz from 1932-38. "'My job,' he states, 'was to bring
    people to St. Moritz. I knew that if I did abstract designs most people
    would not understand and so would not be motivated. I had to create an
    atmosphere that gives one the desire to breathe fresh air, soak up warm sun
    and ski. So I knew I must have color.' His decision to apply bright colors
    with an airbrush to his inventive photomontages was concurrent with Herbert
    Matter's now iconographic Swiss tourism posters" (Heller, AIGA, 1987). It
    was a "revolutionary, identity campaign. As Herdeg notes, 'I was heading up
    a corporate design program without knowing that such a thing existed.' . . .
    this was certainly the first time a health resort ever tried to do
    'corporate design.' Herdeg created a memorable campaign based on a
    delightful trademark of a brightly shining sun which, to his credit, is
    still used today. And which he proudly had carved onto a ring that he always
    wears" (ibid.). Herdeg was also the founder of <I>Graphis</i>, the
    influential graphic design magazine.

    The modern-day Oresund Bridge (which connects Sweden and Denmark) consists

    the two nations had been fermenting since the late 19th century. In the
    1930s, it clearly was used to lure visitors to this Danish tourism
    exhibition, <I>Holidays in the North</i>." The image is of a space-age

    Mora was a prominent California artist of Uruguayan heritage who was
    well-known as a cartoonist, painter, cartographer, illustrator, photographer
    and sculptor. In 1998 the Monterey Museum of Art held an exhibition of his
    work, which they described as follows: "Apart from its artistic merits,
    Mora's work is valued for its historical significance. As an astute
    observer, Mora created art that eloquently and accurately described the
    western land and way of life he admired, whether his subject was vaqueros,
    Hopi katsina figures, the Arizona landscape, turn-of-the-century Yosemite,
    or the California missions."  Copyrighted in 1936, this version was printed

    men's and boys coats. These promotional posters were printed for the years
    1938, 1939, 1940 and 1941. After World War II broke out, F.E. Cheeseman
    veered away from football-themed maps, in favor of more overtly-patriotic
    subjects. "Pictorial maps also showed American sports and pastimes. The
    regionalist movement of the 1930s, well represented by WPA guides to
    individual states, inspired an interest in folklore . . . American sports
    were also mapped, notably by F.E. Cheeseman in his series of college
    football maps" (Picturing America p, 79.)

    Sesser was a teacher at Detroit's School of Applied Art who is known to have
    designed one poster during the First World War and several posters for the
    North German Lloyd shipping company in 1914. Sesser beat out over 80 artists
    in a competition to design a Centennial poster for Illinois. His "design
    became familiar to the people of the State as the Centennial poster. The
    Centennial Commission reproduced it in color and in various sizes, from the
    full-size poster down to the "sticker" size to be used on letters and
    packages and widely distributed" (Blue Book of the State Of Illinois,
    1919-1920, p. 320). The Official Report of the Centennial Commission
    explains the design, "A Pioneer with a flint-lock musket. Kneels in
    reverence to the United States Flag. The present State House of Illinois is
    in the background showing the progress of the century. Above the head of the
    pioneer appears the dates '1818-1918' and twenty stars, representing the
    twenty states admitted before Illinois. On a line below in the center, the
    new star, Illinois, appears" (Ibid. p. 416). The words at the bottom are
    from a song written by Civil War veteran Charles Chamberlin, composed as
    part of Chicago’s bid to the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (where it was
    ultimately held). In 1925, seven years after the state's Centennial, the
    song was made the official Illinois state song. <i>Rare.</i>

    In the 1920s, the Chicago train companies, including the North Shore Line,

    city's finest graphic designers to produce advertising posters that
    encouraged Chicagoans to use rapid transit for more than commuting to work"
    (www.Chicago-L.org). He is credited with designing 29 posters between 1923
    and his death at an early age, in 1926. His compositions and graphic style
    set him among the best of American designers from the period. This is one of

    German-born Leyendecker came to America at the age of eight and entered the
    advertising world by the time he was sixteen. However, it wasn't until after
    he had spent five years studying at the Académie Julian in Paris that he
    matured into a full-fledged illustrator. "His first [<I>Saturday
    Evening</i>] <I>Post</i> cover was done in 1899, and he did well over 300
    more during the next 40 years . . . His advertising illustrations made his
    clients famous. The Arrow Collar Man was a byword for the debonair, handsome
    male, and women wrote thousands of love letters to him" (The Illustrator in
    America, p. 150). Here, in a tableau that could be straight out of a
    modern-day fashion advertisement, one of his chiseled, dashing young men,
    with oars on his shoulder, stares out at the viewer with the confident
    assurance of youth. The young lady, fashionable herself behind the wheel of
    a sports car and beneath a stylish hat, seems to be looking out as well
    while slyly gazing at her companion in a smitten manner. <i>Rare.</i> We

    This is the poster for the French language release of Chaplin's movie "The
    Tramp." Chaplin once explained his recurring Tramp character to Mack
    Sennett, an official of the New York Motion Picture Company, "You know this
    fellow is many-sided, a tramp, a gentleman, a poet, a dreamer, a lonely
    fellow, always hopeful of romance and adventure. He would have you believe
    he is a scientist, a musician, a duke, and a polo-player. However, he is not
    above picking up cigarette-butts or robbing a baby of its candy. And, of
    course, if the occasion warrants it, he will kick a lady in the rear—but
    only in extreme anger!” (Chaplin, My Autobiography, London 1964, p. 155).

  TYPESET: >-
    Germaine Marx, studied art in France in the 1920s, and designed a number of
    archetypal Art Deco movie posters -largely stylized portraits of performers,
    none is as captivating as this bustling, energetic composition for "La Femme
    de Mes Rêves." The film, "The Woman of my Dreams," is about a penniless
    musician who seduces a wealthy American widow, lives with her in her hotel
    until he is able to successfully marry her. The montage-like layout and
    imagery are reminiscent of graphic treatment for movie posters coming out of
    Russia during the same period. Such was the quality of her artistry, that in
    1932 her posters were featured alongside those of A.M. Cassandre, Paul
    Colin, Jean Carlu and Charles Loupot in a special edition of an art and
    literature publication called <I>Les Cahiers Jaune</i>," published by Jose
    Corti, dedicated to Masters of the French Poster. During the 1930s she
    married Francois Verna and due to the onset of World War II, they settled in
    Switzerland, where she spent the remainder of her career painting landscapes
    and portraits.
