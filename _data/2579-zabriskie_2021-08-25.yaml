    encountering the elderly French photographer's work in 1925 at the Man Ray
    Studio. After Atget’s death, in 1927, she collaborated with Julien Levy, of
    New York’s Julien Levy Gallery, to buy most of Atget’s negatives and prints,
    bringing them back to New York in 1929.  Abbott’s initiative preserved
    Atget's archive, which, given its influence on the avant-garde, has become
    an important chapter of Abbott’s legacy.

    Artist's estate, New York.<br><br>Walkowitz was born in Tyumen, Sibera to
    Jewish parents and immigrated to the Lower East Side of New York with his
    mother in 1889.  He was trained in the academic style at the National
    Academy of Design, New York, and at the Académie Julian in Paris, though his
    style was most influenced by his experiences outside of the studio.  During
    his time in Paris from 1906-07, Walkowitz saw Isadora Duncan (1877-1927)
    dance at Auguste Rodin's (1840-1917) Paris studio and made his first
    drawings of her. He later recalled, "She was a Muse. She had no laws. She
    didn't dance according to rules. She created. Her body was music. It was a
    body electric, like Walt Whitman." Like Duncan's dancing, Walkowitz's
    drawings and watercolors were created by quick and spontaneous lines and
    washes of color. In Paris, Walkowitz was also impressed by the landmark 1907
    Paul Cézanne (1839-1906) retrospective exhibit at the <i>Salon d'Automne</i>
    and by his introduction to the work of Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and Henri
    Rousseau (1844-1910).  By the time Walkowitz returned to New York, his style
    was heavily influenced by European Modernism, with emphasis on gestures,
    simplified forms and flat planes of bold color.  His first solo exhibition
    was held at Haas Gallery, the back of a modest frame shop, in New York in
    1908. <br><br>In 1912, Walkowitz met Albert Stieglitz (1864-1946) through
    Marsden Hartley (1877-1943) and became involved with the 291 Gallery, New
    York, which served as a hub of American modernism. Stieglitz was so
    impressed by the young artist, that he sent him to study art in Greece,
    Italy and North Africa in 1914.  His style became more abstract; its reduced
    linear forms lent themselves to the city's rush skyward, prematurely
    anticipating the New York School and the Abstract Expressionists. <br><br>In
    1913, Walkowitz was represented at the Armory Show and in the 1916 Forum
    exhibition.  Walkowitz was concerned with politics and artists' rights and
    was active in various artist's groups, founding the People's Art Guild and
    the Society of Independent Artists (he became director of the latter from
    1918 to 1938).  In 1920, he exhibited at the Société Anonyme alongside Man
    Ray (1890-1976), Hartley and Joseph Stella (1877-1946).  Despite local and
    international recognition, Walkowitz was not nearly as well-known as his
    contemporaries.  Virginia Zabriskie was among the many figures in the field,
    including Stieglitz, Henry McBride, Carl Van Vechten and Lloyd Goodrich, who
    thought that Walkowitz deserved more notice than he was given.
    <br><br>Walkowitz painted into the 1940s, when his eyesight began to fail. 
    Zabriskie represented him during the last six years of the artist's life. 
    She admired him for his work that was so archetypal of New York and for his
    passion and conviction.  Zabriskie Gallery held thirteen exhibitions of
    Walkowitz's work and placed him in the collections of major institutions. 
    In promoting his legacy, Zabriskie grew close to the aging artist,
    accompanying him to the Academy of Arts and Letters award ceremony in May
    1962, where Walkowitz was given the Marjorie Peabody Waite Award for a
    distinguished elderly artist, to a standing ovation.  After his death,
    Zabriskie purchased the Abraham Walkowitz Estate, including numerous
    watercolors and paintings left undiscovered in his studio.  Zabriskie
    organized Walkowitz's memorial service and remembered him as a devoted,
    often feisty artist whose work was not fully understood in his lifetime.

    third and final cast of this bronze is in the collection of the Hirshhorn
    Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.<br><br>Provenance: Artist's
    estate, New York.<br><br>Though the majority of Walkowitz's <i>œuvre</i> are
    paintings and works on paper, the artist was also a sculptor.  He likely
    received instruction in sculpture during his formal training in New York and
    Paris and supplemented his knowledge of the human form with anatomy classes
    at the Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital in New York.  In Paris, Walkowitz
    visited Auguste Rodin's (1840-1917) studio and may have been influenced by
    his work, though he placed great importance on portraying naturalized,
    non-idealized bodies, such as New York laborers.  Walkowitz exhibited his
    early sculptures into the 1920s but was always known best as a painter.
    <br><br>Walkowitz's painting and drawing style of expressing the essence of
    the subject by using simplified, almost naive forms carried over into his
    sculpture. The present work recalls Oscar Bluemner's 1913 essay on Walkowitz
    in Camera Work</i>.  He wrote that Walkowitz, "can increase the vibration of
    strong charcoal-tones— say the motif of a muscular back— to a degree that
    one imagines a thunderstorm."

  TYPESET: >-
    <br>Oil on canvas.  505x430 mm; 20x17 inches.  Signed, titled and dated in
    ink, verso.  1918.<br><br>As a teenager, Eugenie immigrated with her family
    from Poland to the United States. Having completed formal training at the
    Odessa Art School, Eugenie continued her studies in New York at the National
    Academy of Design and at the Educational Alliance.  Classically trained,
    with Old Master artists as her model, Eugenie's early output was more muted
    and figural than the vivid abstractions of her mature
    <i>œuvre</i>.<br><br>Saul Baizerman (1889-1957) was born in Vitebsk, Russia
    and moved to Odessa with his family as an adolescent. He wished to become a
    sculptor from an early age, watching his father, a harness maker by trade,
    hammer metal and leather hides. Saul was surrounded by revolutionary
    activity and political turmoil in Odessa.  At age sixteen, he was
    imprisoned, though escaped to the United States after serving one and half
    years for his revolutionary ties.  In 1910, Saul settled in New York, where
    he continued his artistic training at the Beaux-Art Institute of Design and
    attended much of the same schools as Eugenie, Moses Soyer (1899-1974),
    Raphael Soyer (1899-1987) and Chaim Gross (1902-1991).<br><br>Saul and
    Eugenie married in 1920, at a time when Saul was beginning to become noticed
    for his small hammered bronze sculptures of the working class.  The two
    artists traveled through Europe during the early 1920s, Saul exhibiting his
    "Labor Series" in London and Paris before the couple's daughter was born in
    New York in 1926.<br><br>Saul's physically arduous technique of hammering
    sheets of copper related directly to his portraits of New York laborers. His
    exertion, evident in the works themselves, is reflected by his subjects.
    Saul was impeded by a studio fire in 1931 which destroyed all of his copper
    works in progress, though he was widely exhibited through the 1930s and
    1940s. <br><br>Eugenie's abstract paintings, which put color theory before
    form, borrowed from Expressionism.  When she did include subjects, they were
    characterized as being "buried under a blanket of petals" so that the scenes
    shrunk into the background.  She exhibited independently at the Artists
    Gallery, New York in 1938 and 1950, though she never sold a work.  In 1948,
    the Baizermans exhibited together Saul's monumental hammered work and
    Eugenie's broadly painted colorful canvases at the Artists Gallery.
    <br><br>Eugenie died in 1949 and Saul's health began to decline.  His career
    in the 1950s was marked by high praise and honors.  In 1953, the Walker Art
    Center, Minneapolis, organized his first retrospective.  By the time Saul
    remarried in 1955, he had already withdrawn from his artistic work. When he
    died in 1957, he left behind a studio of large sculpture and a group of
    critics, collectors, and gallerists dedicated to his work, including
    Virginia Zabriskie and Joseph Hirshhorn. Though Eugenie remained an obscure
    artist, Krasner Galleries held a favorably received retrospective exhibition
    of her work in 1961 and Zabriskie Gallery exhibited her paintings from 1969
    through 1988 and most recently in 2000.

    Fifty Years</i>, 2004, page 82 (illustrated).<br><br>Hartl, born in Paris
    and trained as a master dyer, was admired by fellow artists for his
    untrained innate talent and sense of color.  The artist Fairfield Porter
    (1907-1975) wrote admiringly of his career and technique in Art News</i> in
    1953, noting that Hartl drew directly with paint and never added medium to
    his pigments, only using turpentine for erasing.  He told Porter, "Art is a
    feeling of things, not a description of them.  When you are young you are
    sensual, later your exaltation is more spiritual."<br><br>When Hartl came to
    the United States in 1912, he turned to painting to assuage his
    homesickness.  At first, he painted French flowers and birds from memory but
    even his mature work was autobiographical of either his life in France or
    New York.  Hartl used real-life references to inform his color choices (an
    apple and fallen leaves for a landscape scene) and usually worked on
    multiple paintings at once.  Though his career spanned the Abstract movement
    in the United States, Hartl remained steadfast with representative art.  In
    1920, he exhibited in group shows at the New Gallery alongside Ernest Fiene
    (1894-1965), Arnold Friedman (1879-1946), Joseph Stella (1877-1946) and Carl
    Sprinchorn (1877-1971).  He was represented by Juliana Force of the Whitney
    Studio Galleries (formerly Whitney Studio Club) from its formation in 1928
    through its metamorphosis into the Whitney Museum in 1931.  Hartl had
    numerous solo exhibitions in New York, with one at Zabriskie Gallery in
    1967.

    career of four decades was marked by reinvention and a commitment to his
    vision of the endless possibilities of American Art.<br><br>Born Ivan
    Dabrowsky in Kiev, Graham was a law student and a czarist soldier in the
    1917 revolution.  After imprisonment and the downfall of Nicholas II, Graham
    left Russia and arrived in the United States in 1920.  Though it is unclear
    if he showed artistic inclination in Russia, Graham recreated himself as an
    art student in New York.  He attended the Art Students League from 1922 to
    1924, where he studied under John Sloan (1871-1951).  In a meteoric rise to
    recognition, Graham’s first solo museum exhibition was organized by Duncan
    Philips in 1929.<br><br>Like many early career artists, Graham traveled to
    Paris (his work would later be exhibited at Galerie Zabriskie, Paris) and he
    came under the influence of the Surrealists and their psychoanalytical
    approach, however he remained dedicated to his mission of creating a new
    American Art.  Along with Stuart Davis (1892-1964) and Arshile Gorky
    (1904-1948), Graham would provide a foundation for American Modernism and
    would be sought out by a new generation of the New York School (his
    watershed 1937 treatise, <i>System and Dialectics of Art</i> had advanced
    the Abstract Expressionist movement).<br><br>During the 1940s, Graham
    departed from his post-Cubist style, and adopted a new loosened, abstract
    style.  At this time, he served as a mentor to younger artists such as
    Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Arshile Gorky, whose works would
    shape the Abstract Expressionist movement.  Graham was also considered
    influential to Lee Krasner (Pollock's wife and an artist in her own right),
    David Smith, Dorothy Dehner (then married to Smith) and Mark
    Rothko.<br><br>In his mature career, he found inspiration in Old Master
    works and he approached his canvases with a measure of dignity and
    mysticism.  His portraits are powerful, standing out boldly from their
    flattened back drops.  Simultaneously, Graham conveyed a delicate luminosity
    and vulnerability; his courtesans’ askew eyes act to ground the figure in a
    plane between fantasy and reality.  This merging of worlds characterizes not
    only Graham’s work but also his storied, monumental life.

    daily struggles of those living in New York City.  His chosen subject matter
    became especially poignant at the onset of the Great Depression, and, after
    he began to exhibit his work in the late 1920s, he cemented his reputation
    among the top realist painters of the 20th century.<br><br>His time spent at
    Cape Cod, however, reveals a different side of the artist.  He traveled
    there throughout his life where he visited friends, including Edward Hopper
    (1882-1967), and allowed him to experiment with pure landscape scenes. These
    works diverge from his figural, social realist work and show a colorful and
    modern approach to depicting the vivid New England scenery.

    composition, technique, and printing, establishing herself alongside other
    avant-garde artists. Bing said, “It was a time of exploration and discovery
    ... We wanted to show what the camera could do that no brush could do, and
    we broke every rule. We photographed into the light—even photographed the
    light, used distorted perspective, and showed movement as a blur. What we
    photographed was new, too—torn paper, dead leaves, puddles in the
    street—people thought it was garbage! But going against the rules opened the
    doors to new possibilities.” Bing gifted this print to Zabriskie, noting her
    early excursion with Konrad Wolff, who would become her husband.

    <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>.  His first model was his wife, who worked closely
    with him throughout his life.  Kollar, who had early experience working in
    factory and industrial settings, also became well-known as a master of
    industrial reportage. His imagery examined the changing nature of work
    during the transitional early 20th century, representing in expressive and
    modern compositions the changing landscape and the place of the individual. 
    All of Kollar's compositions demonstrate his deft treatment of light and
    texture, and feature numerous modern techniques, including abstracted
    lighting, superimosition, double exposures and solarization.

    traveled to Paris where he studied with Fernand Léger (1881-1955) and Amédée
    Ozenfant (1866-1966) and devoted himself to abstract art.  He practiced his
    own form of Cubism, which was steadfast throughout his career even as
    Expressionism became the preferred form of abstraction.  He also advocated
    for the recognition of an American abstract art, relaunching the <i>Partisan
    Review</i> (of which he was an editor and contributed as a writer) and was a
    founding member of the American Abstract Artists, acting as its president in

    (1904-1956) were among the earliest American artists to produce abstract
    art, creating experimental, non-objective works in the 1930s.  Balcomb began
    his career studying and teaching psychology, while Gertrude focused her
    early studies on sculpture at the Leonardo da Vinci School in New York. 
    When the couple married in 1926, they moved to Vienna where Balcomb
    continued his studies in psychology before moving to New Hampshire for three
    years when Balcomb was hired by Dartmouth.  After his tenure at the
    university, Balcomb recognized his true passion was painting and in 1931 he
    went to Paris to study at the Academie de la Grande Chaumière.  During this
    time, Gertrude was committed to her work as a sculptor and was inspired by
    abstract movements such as Constructivism and Neo-plasticism.<br><br>Both
    artists produced and championed abstract art in their artistic output as
    well as through activism, particularly during the 1930s.  Gertrude continued
    her three-dimensional work through the 1930s to the mid-1940s before
    pivoting to painting for the remainder of her career.  Balcomb focused on
    non-objective art through the 1940s before reintroducing the figure into his
    work later in his career.  They were founding members of the American
    Abstract Artists group when it was formed in 1937.  Gertrude was its first
    paid employee, working the desk at the Squibb Gallery exhibition in 1937
    (the organization’s first yearly show), and Balcomb was its first chairman. 
    Its mission was to gain acceptance of abstract art within the mainstream
    artistic communities.  In addition to its group exhibitions, the Greenes
    along with other members took a more active approach and routinely picketed
    art museums that did not feature abstract art.

    Paterson, New Jersey and studied at St. Stephen’s College (now Bard College)
    in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.  In 1931, he started an apprenticeship
    with Paul Fiene (1899-1949), which lasted several years.  He also worked
    with William Zorach (1889-1966) at the Art Students League of New York and
    studied in Paris at the Academie de la Grande Chaumière with the sculptor
    Ossip Zadkine (1890-1967).<br><br>While he never identified with a
    particular style or movement, he found inspiration in Indigenous carvings of
    the Pacific Northwest, American folk art and American and European modern
    art movements.  His sculptures depicted abstract and figural totems as well
    as robust female forms, and he worked with natural materials such as wood,
    stone and clay, eschewing machinery.  He also worked in two dimensions,
    creating collages, paintings and works on paper. He was an accomplished
    writer, publishing extensively on Brancusi, among other artists, and taught
    at several institutions, including the University of California, Berkeley,
    Pratt Institute and Vassar College.

    abandonment of figurative painting in 1928 and she dedicated herself
    exclusively to abstraction.  While living in France she gained success and
    recognition, and in the 1930s she became a member of the French abstract

    remained committed to abstract art, often in the form of floating,
    quasi-biomorphic shapes.  She engaged in innovative approaches to
    abstraction through her thread and wire constructions, which are seen as a
    significant contribution to the modern abstract artistic movement and rank
    among her most original works.<br><br>In 1952, the artist and publisher
    André Bloc (1896-1966) invited her to form a London branch of the Parisian

    Art. Inspired by André Breton’s (1896-1966) manifesto, she painted her first
    surrealist work in 1930.  She exhibited with the Surrealists in England and
    abroad, including at the 1936 International Surrealist Exhibition at the New

    reputation of being among the most adventurous and influential artists of
    the Surrealist movement in Britian.

    his original concept to memorialize New York and its soaring skyscrapers,
    with steel balls in a glass test tube and brought it with him to Paris in
    1921, where he told the French customs officer that the jar would give him
    the illusion of having something to eat.  The first version has been

    <i>New York II</i> (alternately titled <i>Export Commodity</i>, <i>Roulement

    this 1925 version from Juliet Man Ray, Paris.  This version broken and

    <br>Metronome with holographic paper ready-made.  230x110 mm; 9x4⅜ inches. 
    Signed and numbered 32/40 in felt-tip pen and ink on the underside. 
    Published by Il Fauno, Turin.  1970.  <br><br>Martin 31. <br><br>Provenance:
    Acquired from Julien Levy, New York. <br><br>The original 1922-23 object,
    titled <i>Object to be Destroyed (Objet à détruire)</i> consisted of a
    photograph of an eye attached with a paperclip to a metronome.  Man Ray
    created the object spontaneously as he was painting in rhythm with a
    metronome in his studio.  The act of destruction was an additional
    conceptual component to the art object, the dismantling also viewed as a
    creative act (most of Man Ray's original objects only exist in
    photographs).  In 1932, after it had already been destroyed by Man Ray in
    his studio, he remade <i> Object to be Destroyed</i> to exhibit, this time
    with a photograph of the eye of his former lover, Lee Miller.  Another
    replica was created after the 1932 version was lost when Man Ray fled Paris
    for New York in 1940.  This replica was created for Julien Levy Gallery, New
    York in 1945, and called <i>Lost Object</i> (also called <i>Last
    Object</i>).  It was one of 10 “Objects of my Affection” exhibited at the
    gallery in April 1945.  In the cataloguing for <i>Lost Object</i> was the
    artist’s intent, “It is still my earnest desire, some day while the eye is
    ticking away during a conversation, to lift my hammer and with one
    well-aimed blow to completely demolish the metronome.”  Anti-Dada
    demonstrators attending the 1957 Dada exhibition at the Galerie de
    l'Institut in Paris removed <i>Lost Object</i> and destroyed it.
    <br><br>Some years later, Man Ray collaborated with artist Daniel Spoerri,
    who had founded his publishing house Edition MAT (multiplication d’art
    transformable), Paris in 1959.  Spoerri was a pioneer in producing
    “multiples,” or editions of three-dimensional art objects and specialized in
    kinetic works.  Spoerri produced Man Ray’s <i>Lampshade</i>, in 1965 and
    subsequently Edition MAT recreated <i>Lost Object</i>, this time with the
    title <i>Object indestructible</i> in an edition of 100.  In 1970, Man Ray
    authorized another 40 objects to be produced by Luciano Anselmino of
    Galleria il Fauno, Turin and Milan.  This next iteration of the object, the
    edition from which the current lot is part, was called <i>Perpetual
    Motif</i> and featured Lee Miller’s eye as a double printed image, made to
    blink as the pendulum swings.  <i>Perpetual Motif</i> was followed by <i>Do
    Not Destroy,</i> the last lifetime edition of 100 issued for the New York
    Cultural Center’s 1974 retrospective.

    readymades at Galleria Schwarz in Milan in the 1960s and 70s, Man Ray also
    had multiples made from his lost original objects.  The two artists worked
    closely with Arturo Schwarz in these replications, with the knowledge that
    the multiples would allow the artist to hold more complete exhibitions of
    his œuvre and further his legacy.  <br><br>In order to defamiliarize the
    viewer with an object, Man Ray used repetition with some variation.  To
    subvert the meaning of a hand iron,  Man Ray used the iconic <i>Cadeau</i>,
    an iron with tacks affixed to the sole in 1921.  To reference the original
    readymade and its later replicas, Man Ray later created two other iron
    readymades, <i>Le Fer rouge</i> (1966) and <i>Phare de la harpe</i> (1967). 
    Keeping in the Dada tradition, the title of the present work is an anagram,
    an exercise in visual and literal meaning.

    from Marion Meyer, widow of the art dealer Marcel Zerbib, Paris. 
    <br><br>After Lee Miller left Man Ray for New York in 1932, he used art to
    cope with his despair.  Man Ray became obsessed with Miller's lips and spent
    two years painting <i>l'Heure de l'Observatoire </i>, the 1934 oil on canvas
    of Miller's monumental disembodied floating lips (held by a private
    collection). Her lips would also appear in the lead and rope 1933 object
    <i>Lovers</i> and in the illustrated anthology of poems by Paul Éluard,
    <i>Les mains libres</i>.  It was during this post-break up that Man Ray
    would create his <i> Object indestructible </i>, the metronome with Miller's
    eye on the ticking arm.  <br><br>Late in his career, and long after Man Ray
    and Miller reconciled as friends, he worked with several publishers to
    create editions of his early readymades.  <i>Lovers</i> was reproduced in an
    edition of 9 by Lucien Treillard in 1973; <i> Object indestructible</i> was
    issued as a multiple in 1965, 1970, and 1974; and <i>A l'Heure de
    l'Observatoire</i> would be reproduced as a limited edition print.  Ray also
    created new, original designs for editioned multiples to coincide with the
    revivals of his earlier concepts.  The outline of Miller's lips were applied
    to <i> Lèvres d'Or</i>, the title being a play on the French words "lèvres"
    (lips) and "livres" (book).

    (offered here as well as lot 137). Her visual approach is best characterized
    as semi-pictorialist, with soft, luxurious values and a quiet gaze, her
    technical skill rendering the imagery in both beautiful and precise terms.
    She published and exhibited widely, and had the first one-person exhibition
    at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1925, which garnered her increasing
    attention and helped establish her reputation. Her fashion work appeared in
    <i>Vogue</i> (the first in 1922), and other imagery was published in both
    <i>Vu</i> and <i>Arts & Metiers Graphiques</i> magazines. She was named
    president of the French Société des Artistes, among other key posts, and
    served as president of the Union féminine des carrières libérales et
    commerciales, an organization bent on supporting the interests of women in
    professional life.

    at the Kiev Art School from 1902-05.  Moving to Paris in 1908, he continued
    his studies at the École des Beaux-Arts for a short time before studying
    independently through visits to the Musée du Louvre.  During these early
    years, he was drawn to Ancient and early Gothic sculpture, but he took a
    modern approach to his own work, being one of the first sculptors to adopt
    the principles of Cubism by showing a figure in multiple views and utilizing
    sculptural voids and negative space.  In 1913, four of his sculptures and
    five of his drawings were exhibited at the Armory Show in New York.  In
    1923, he moved to New York, where he was deeply influential on young
    American modernist artists, and continued to create sculptures, innovating
    the medium through his use of color, unexpected mediums and incorporating
    collage of various objects.

    first began photographing in 1952, when he received a camera as a therapy
    tool after recovering from Tuberculosis. A chance meeting with Pablo Picasso
    on a Vallauris street in 1953 formed a strong friendship and collaboration
    between the two artists. Villers photographed Picasso frequently, and the
    two created a renewed life around Cubism, experimenting with the camera's
    role in the artist movement.

    <br>Welded steel.  1520x914x914 mm; 60x36x36 inches.  Indistinctly incised
    with the artist's initials and date on the base.  Circa
    1960.<br><br>Zabriskie Gallery represented Stankiewicz from 1972 to 2009,
    and promoted his work with conviction.  Often called “Junk Art”,
    Stankiewicz’s works were created from discarded scrap metal welded together
    into abstract figures.  He titled his works in reference to what the figures
    were according to his imagination, which often had a sense of humor.  As the
    separate scraps come together in rhythmic, buoyant forms, the culmination
    transcends the “Junk Art” label.  <br><br>Stankiewicz’s work is an extension
    of his biography.  In 1928, Stankiewicz and his mother moved from
    Philadelphia to the Rust Belt city of Detroit.  During the Great Depression,
    they lived in a small apartment neighboring a foundry dump, where
    Stankiewicz used to play and create his own toys from the scrap.  He studied
    mechanical drafting before entering the Navy in 1941.  While he was
    stationed in the Pacific, Stankiewicz would carve figures from found wood
    and animal bones.  After his service, he moved to New York and studied under
    Hans Hofmann, followed by instruction from Fernand Léger and sculptor Ossip
    Zadkine in Paris.  Back in New York by 1952, Stankiewicz helped to found the
    Hansa Gallery alongside Wolf Kahn, where he would show his welded scrap
    metal sculptures.  He was widely exhibited in New York and internationally,
    though Stankiewicz felt that the market for his work had cooled in 1965
    since he had moved to Massachusetts.  Finding fault with his representation
    at Stable Gallery at the time, he did not exhibit in New York until
    connecting with Zabriskie in 1972.  His work came back to New York with new
    vigor.  Stankiewicz had discovered new materials and was working at a larger
    scale with the same levity as before.  The Zabriskie Gallery held eighteen
    solo exhibitions of Stankiewicz’s work over two decades.

    and dated in pencil, lower right recto.  1955.<br><br>Johnson came to New
    York in 1947 after studying at the Minneapolis School of Art and the St.
    Paul Art School.  He was befriended by his neighbors Wolf Kahn and Larry
    Rivers during the 1950s before moving to Columbus as an Artist-in-Residence
    at Ohio State University from 1961-62.  He followed this post with a
    residence at the University of Wisconsin and a supplementary academic career
    at Yale University.<br><br>Johnson was one of a group of young New York
    School artists who summered in Springs, East Hampton in the 1950s and 60s. 
    He would return to Springs throughout his career and counted Saul Steinberg
    and Willem and Elaine Kooning as neighbors. <br><br>Though Johnson’s work
    was characterized as Abstract Expressionism, he departed from this already
    loosely defined canon by including figures and interior forms.  His
    physically vigorous technique of action painting created portraits with a
    breadth of tangible presences--from exuberant joy to isolated stoicism to
    existential despair.   In the 1970s Johnson moved to portraying colorful
    narrative crowded street scenes.  <br><br>Like Pat Adams (born 1928) and
    Clinton Hill (1922-2003),  Johnson was represented by Korman Galleries
    before the roster was inherited by Virginia Zabriskie.  His work would be
    shown by Zabriskie in New York and Paris several times from 1954 to 1985,
    helping to cement his position as a leading figure in the New York school.

    early training in a work-study program at the Ox-Bow School of Art, in
    Saugatuck, Michigan, and at the Museum for the Contemporary Arts and the Art
    Institute Department of Prints and Drawings, Chicago.  She spent the early
    years of her career in her hometown, where she was often identified with the
    Chicago Imagists and painted primarily modernist cityscapes and portraits. 
    In the 1970s, Lanyon moved to New York and became a member of the Heresies
    Collective, which created <i>Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and
    Politics</i>.  Over the course of her career, Lanyon has had over
    seventy-five solo gallery exhibitions and eleven museum exhibitions,
    including three major traveling retrospectives.  Her work is in the
    collections of the Art Institute of Chicago; the Museum of Contemporary Art,
    Chicago; the Brooklyn Museum; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the

    1984.<br><br>Resnick trained at the Pratt Institute, New York, where he
    studied commercial art, before transferring to the American Artists School
    to focus on painting.  Among the first generation of the New York School
    artists, he was friends with Abstract Expressionists such as Arshile Gorky
    and Willem de Kooning.  Resnick sought to dissolve form and image, employing
    the sculptural elements of the paint.  He eclipsed the traditional modes of
    Abstract Expressionsim in the mid 1940s and created dense and heavily
    impastoed paintings that sometimes weighed more than 300 pounds.  His foray
    into the materiality of paint was predictive of artists such as Cy Twombly
    and Frank Stella who focused on process and an "all-over" approach to
    developing a canvas.

    Goldfarb was a contemporary of the New York School, attending the Art
    Students League in 1949 where she met Jackson Pollock (1912-1956).  Goldfarb
    did not stay in New York for long after her studies, though continued to
    paint in the Abstract Expressionist style into the 1960s.  In 1954, she
    moved to Paris, where she forged her career as a female abstract artist with
    an unshakable identity.  Goldfarb embraced the Parisian art scene and was
    welcomed into the same circles as Man Ray (1890-1976) and other American
    ex-pats.  Distance from New York perhaps led her to develop her unique style
    which blended French pointillism, sophisticated color theory, and her roots
    in abstraction.  She was renown in her mature career for her monumental
    works of loose gridded dabs of bright, radiating colors.

    <br>Oil on canvas.  445x705 mm; 17½x27¾ inches.  Signed and dated in oil,
    lower right recto.  1961.<br><br>Published: <i>Zabriskie Fifty Years</i>,
    2004, page 98 (illustrated).<br><br>Hartl, born in Paris and trained as a
    master dyer, was admired by fellow artists for his untrained innate talent
    and sense of color.  The artist Fairfield Porter (1907-1975) wrote
    admiringly of his career and technique in Art News</i> in 1953, noting that
    Hartl drew directly with paint and never added medium to his pigments, only
    using turpentine for erasing.  He told Porter, "Art is a feeling of things,
    not a description of them.  When you are young you are sensual, later your
    exaltation is more spiritual."<br><br>When Hartl came to the United States
    in 1912, he turned to painting to assuage his homesickness.  At first, he
    painted French flowers and birds from memory but even his mature work was
    autobiographical of either his life in France or New York.  Hartl used
    real-life references to inform his color choices (an apple and fallen leaves
    for a landscape scene) and usually worked on multiple paintings at once. 
    Though his career spanned the Abstract movement in the United States, Hartl
    remained steadfast with representative art. In 1920, he exhibited in group
    shows at the New Gallery alongside Ernest Fiene (1894-1965), Arnold Friedman
    (1879-1946), Joseph Stella (1877-1946) and Carl Sprinchorn (1877-1971).  He
    was represented by Juliana Force of the Whitney Studio Galleries (formerly
    Whitney Studio Club) from its formation in 1928 through its metamorphosis
    into the Whitney Museum in 1931.  Hartl had numerous solo exhibitions in New
    York, with one at Zabriskie Gallery in 1967.

    more than 25 countries in the past 30 years, including trips to the tops of
    Mount Everest and Denali. “If I do not walk, I cannot make a work of art,”
    Fulton explains. “The physical involvement of walking creates a
    receptiveness to the landscape.  I walk on the land to be woven into
    nature.  A road walk can transform the everyday world and give a heightened
    sense of human history.” Fulton translates his walks into other media,
    including photographs, wall texts, and drawings, allowing the viewer to
    participate in his primary medium.

    was born in London and moved to the United States as a child in 1940. 
    Dance, rather than painting or sculpture, was her early passion.  She
    studied with Martha Graham (1894-1991) whose influenced the remainder of her
    career even after she quit dancing and began working as a sculptor and
    painter.  Largely self-taught, she had some formal artistic training,
    studying wood carving at Alfred van Loen’s studio, drawing with Max Beckmann
    (1884-1950) at the Brooklyn Museum Art School, and taking night classes with
    Hans Hofmann (1880-1966) at his Eight Street School.  Her early works
    explored mythological and primitive themes in a variety of sculpture mediums
    and drawing. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, she began to work with
    clay, which became a preferred medium for its malleability.  Her ceramic
    sculptures often depict the human body in motion in fluid form, evoking her
    time spent studying dance.  Later in her career, she turned increasingly
    towards painting and embracing color.  In 1969, she started exhibiting with
    the Zabriskie Gallery who would show her work over the following decades.

    working as a sculptor and painter.  Largely self-taught, she had some formal

    drawing with Max Beckmann (1884-1950) at the Brooklyn Museum Art School, and
    taking night classes with Hans Hofmann (1880-1966) at his Eight Street
    School.  Her early works explored mythological and primitive themes in a
    variety of sculpture mediums and drawing. During the late 1960s and early
    1970s, she began to work with clay, which became a preferred medium for its
    malleability.  Her ceramic sculptures often depict the human body in motion
    in fluid form, evoking her time spent studying dance.  Later in her career,
    she turned increasingly towards painting and embracing color.  In 1969, she
    started exhibiting with the Zabriskie Gallery who would show her work over
    the following decades. Her work can be found in the permanent collections of

    1979.<br><br>Snelson's sculptural œuvre, characterized by polished steel
    tubes suspended with cables, was so consistent throughout his forty-year
    career that his work transcends any one art movement or category.  As a
    young boy in Oregon, Snelson enjoyed building models and replicas, though it
    was his love of painting that led him to enroll at Black Mountain College in
    1948 to study with Josef Albers.  Albers recognized and encouraged Snelson's
    affinity for sculpture before he came under the tutelage of Buckminster
    Fuller.  Fuller inspired Snelson's renewed interest in geometry in
    structures.<br><br>Snelson's earliest sculptures were experiments in the
    balance between tension and compression.  He developed self-supporting
    structures where each of the objects in the composition were carefully
    constructed to rely on the assembly as a whole, and not an external prop to
    maintain integrity.   The present work, though mathematical and complex, is
    comprised of simple components arranged harmoniously in an aesthetic
    composition. Snelson's sculptures have ranged from monumental towers to
    small "Atom Sculptures" (Snelson would explore atomic models throughout his
    career).  By the time Zabriskie Gallery showed his work in 1981, Snelson was
    exhibiting internationally and had won several awards.   Zabriskie Gallery
    continued to exhibit the artist in 1986 in New York and Paris and in New
    York in 1990.

    1970.<br><br>Westerlund Roosen was born in New York and is known primarily
    as a sculptor.  Although working in a minimalist aesthetic, she rejects
    traditional Minimalism with its strict geometry, hard edges and industrial
    sensibilities.  Instead, she values the handmade and gives her pieces
    sensuality and movement, imbuing them with life through embracing the
    accidental and imperfect.  Repetition is another important aspect of her
    style, with shapes naturally replicating themselves throughout her
    compositions.  Her work is included in the permanent collection of the
    Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Musuem and the Storm
    King Art Center.
