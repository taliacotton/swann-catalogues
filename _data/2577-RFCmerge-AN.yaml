    "Convinced that war with Germany was inevitable, Frances Adams Halsted wrote
    her poem, <i>Columbia Calls</i>, in 1916. After America entered the war on
    April 6, 1917, Halsted donated both her poem and accompanying image design
    to the U.S. War Department. Three months later, the <i>New York Times</i>
    announced plans to print 500,000 copies as a poster, intending to use the
    proceeds to establish a home for orphaned children of American soldiers and
    sailors. Painter Vincent Aderente, who executed Halsted's design, had
    emigrated from Italy at age six, studied at the Art Students League in New
    York City, and served as an assistant to muralist Edwin Howland Blashfield"

    African Americans served in their own units in the American Expeditionary
    Force, and in some cases, fought side by side with French units. This

    America's World War I poster output was spearheaded by the Department of
    Pictorial Publicity. Formed in 1917, shortly after America entered the war,
    the group was composed of members of the Society of Illustrators and was led
    by Charles Dana Gibson, the man who created the eponymous, ubiquitous
    American sweetheart, the Gibson Girl. The division, which was composed of
    America's most prominent illustrators, artists and cartoonists, donated
    their services to the war effort. Gibson himself designed only a handful of
    posters; this one was taken from an illustration he created for <i>Life</i>
    magazine. Not in Rawls.

    Huntington was a prominent and award-winning sculptor who worked
    predominantly in New York City. She became most famous for her realistic
    bronze animals, for which she conducted preparatory sketches at zoos. Her
    <i>Joan of Arc</i> sculpture, located on Riverside Drive at 93rd Street, was
    the city's first monument dedicated to a historical woman, in 1915 - also
    the city's first public monument by a woman. This <i>rare</i> poster for the
    Betsy Ross Corps puts Huntington's sculptural prowess on display in
    two-dimensional form, as the designer of the Corps' trophy. The paramilitary
    organization of female pilots was founded in 1931 by Opal Kunz, to support
    the Army Air Corps, but was never formally recognized by the U.S. Military.

    to by America's families . . . [but] Hoover often wondered about his

    Willy Stöwer, the son of a sea captain, trained as a shipyard worker but
    soon became a skilled marine painter and illustrator. A favorite naval
    artist of Kaiser Wilhelm II (he even accompanied the Kaiser on voyages), it
    is not surprising that Stöwer was hired by the imperial German fleet to
    promote their submarine weapons and to call upon the public for donations.
    Otherwise-known for his prolific illustrating - "creating approximately 900
    black-and-white and 335 color illustrations for 57 books, as well as
    posters, postcards, trading-cards, labels, brochures and calendars," Stöwer
    gained fame for his depiction of the sinking <i>Titanic</i> in 1912. Here
    "he manages to convey something of the isolation and bleakness of a
    submarine patrol in foul weahter" (Paret p. 34.) Paret 44.

    based on Alfred Leete's poster, <i>Lord Kitchener</i> (1914). This image
    falls chronologically between the two. If British World War I posters failed
    to have all of the emotive power and strength of their American and European
    counterparts, it is because by and large they were designed by printers, and
    not by artists. Paret 67, Rickards 11.

    A <i>rare</i> Canadian World War I image imploring Jews to enlist in the
    army. This poster is an extraordinary call to arms, employing three separate

    of Israel to do his duty," historical association: "The Jews the world over
    love liberty, have fought for it & will fight for it," and following a

    In the years after the First World War, Brazil wrestled with its national
    identity. Brazil had been the only Latin American country to be actively
    involved with the war effort on behalf of the Allies, had a seat at the
    Paris Peace Conference and was a founding member of the League of Nations.
    Back home, strikes, military unrest and ultimately a revolt, were all taking
    place simultaneously as the country set out to celebrate its 100th
    anniversary by hosting one of the first Universal Exhibitions (World's
    Fairs) after the war. Oswald was an Italian-born artist who moved to Brazil
    in 1906. In 1910, the Brazilian government asked him to design the Music
    Room for Brazil's pavilion at the Turin World's Fair. He may be best known
    as the artist who helped design the mighty and monumental "Christ the
    Redeemer" statue standing above Rio de Janeiro, on Corcovado mountain.
    Although most well-known for his religious work, this <i>rare</i> poster of
    maidens parading the flags of the world in front of the buildings of the
    exhibition, displays Oswald's ability as a graphic designer as well as his
    familiarity with the universal graphic language of patriotism. We could find
    no other copies at auction.

    Coiner learned his craft during a six-year stint at an advertising agency in
    Chicago. In 1924, he moved to Philadelphia, where he joined the art
    department at N.W. Ayer. Coiner gained national recognition with the logo he
    designed for the NIRA, The National Industrial Recovery Act. He became a key
    figure in the modern approach to advertising during the late-1930s while
    working with the Container Corporation of America campaigns, for which he
    was allowed to hire all of the avant-garde talents that he wanted. Coiner's
    "Blue Eagle" became a ubiquitous sight in New Deal America, as it was
    displayed coast-to-coast by businesses. It has since become an icon of
    American Modernism. Enacted in 1933, the National Industrial Recovery Act
    was a New Deal public works program intended to provide an economic
    stimulus.

    1924, he worked in the Artistic-Industrial Workshop for Toys in Zagorsk, and
    in 1924 he joined Gosizdat as a graphic designer. The following year, he
    collaborated with David Shterenberg to design the Department of State Trade
    in the Soviet pavilion at the <i>Exposition Internationale des Arts
    Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes</i> in Paris. During the 1930s, he worked

    This is one of a series of five Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
    posters featuring the work of important civil rights photographer, Danny
    Lyon, while he was staff photographer for the committee. The poster was
    likely produced before the July 1963 introduction of zip codes, as the
    address has only the earlier two-digit city zone number. Lyon graduated from
    University of Chicago that same year with a BA in history. "Personal
    participation in the lives of his subjects is a vital component to Danny
    Lyon's photography. His subjects often deviate from societal norms, yet he
    is dedicated to communicating their character and sensibility honestly,
    sympathetically, and nonjudgmentally" (icp.org).

    "The great charm in Mr. Parrish's work lies in its curious individuality. It

    design, but his work is stamped with his own originality. He is adroit
    enough effectively to conceal his borrowings if indeed he has borrowed at
    all. He realises for us a fairyland, undiscovered until he became its
    pioneer . . . every fact in the picture in itself appears to be tangible: it
    is the atmosphere with which Mr. Parrish invests all his facts which
    produces the sense of aloofness and elusiveness which one feels as one looks
    at his drawings. . . . [here] the figures of the three golfers are almost
    photographic in their realism. The undulating landscape, with its trees and

    A <i>rare</i> and wonderful work by Penfield that is exceptional for both
    its size and its content. "Although Penfield continued at <i>Harper's</i> as
    Art Editor until 1901, his poster series stops in 1899" (Designed to
    Persuade, p. 15). In all, he designed over 75 images advertising the
    periodical, each one small enough to hang in a store window. After his
    tenure with the magazine, Penfield went on to design advertisements for
    other publishers and manufacturers. "However, the scope of his career is not
    well-documented in this second phase, and the works of the first two decades
    of this century are more difficult to rediscover" (ibid, p. 17). This
    unusually-sized promotion for a novel features many of the images that
    Penfield used in his <i>Harper's</i> posters, such as the horse-drawn sleigh
    and the dapper figures. "Studying coach design and history was a favorite
    hobby [of the artist], and he later became a collector of these vehicles,
    and wrote about them for <i>Outing</i> magazine. The unfinished manuscript
    of a book on coaches survives among family papers" (ibid p. 13). Bustling
    street scenes also figure prominently in his work, such as the crowds of
    passersby in <i>People We Pass</i>, circa 1896, (Swann sale 2016, lot 84)
    and his poster for <i>Adler Suits & Overcoats</i> (Sale 2099, lot 124),

    Bistolfi was an important Italian sculptor who is credited with having
    designed only this one poster. It promotes an art show in Turin that has
    become historically significant. Not only was it the first international
    exhibition of modern decorative art, but it was the show that launched the
    Liberty style in Italy. It is also considered by some to signify the
    beginning of the end of the Art Nouveau era, as it introduced elements of
    contemporary design that would slowly evolve into the De Stijl, Art Deco and
    Bauhaus schools. Regardless of the historical interpretation, the show
    highlighted some of the greatest European designers. Bistolifi's image is a
    captivating symbolic representation of muses dancing in a field. Clad in the
    flowing robes of antiquity, the bolt of fabric they carry spells out "Ars,"
    art. This is the larger format and French version. Bolaffi p. 22, Manifesto

    Ibels studied at the Academie Julian with Pierre Bonnard and Edouard
    Vuillard and became one of the original members of the Nabis, participating
    in all of their exhibitions. In 1891, his works were exhibited side-by-side
    with Toulouse-Lautrec's at the <i>Salon des Independants</i>, and in 1893 he
    collaborated with Lautrec again to illustrate <i>Le Café Concert</i> for
    Marty, the French publisher. Perhaps Ibels is overlooked as an artistic
    equal to Lautrec and Bonnard because of his decision not to focus on
    painting, but rather to dedicate his artistic efforts to the printed page,
    working for magazines, designing sheet music covers and theatrical programs.
    Within the Nabis, he was known as "The Nabis Journalist," because of his
    work for many of Paris' progressive journals and the founding of the
    short-lived periodical <i>L'Escarmouche</i>. In 1894, he designed the first
    poster for the <i>Salon des Cent</i>, a year before he created this image,
    the largest he was to ever design. Jules Mévisto was a mime and a comedian
    who had a short-lived career performing fairly unpopular sketches in café
    concerts. Ibels had already portrayed the actor as a Pierrot in <i>Entrée en
    Scene</i>, a series of small format lithographs, before he set about
    creating this large poster for the actor's appearance at the Concert de La
    Scala. Against the bleak, nouvelle-urban setting of a busy factory with
    active chimneys, Ibels depicts the images of the actor, in profile, a
    sitting peasant, a soldier and a farmer toiling in the field. All of these
    characters were to be the subject of the socially-critical act that Mévisto
    would deliver. Stylistically, Ibels' layout and outlining are very similar
    to Lautrec's, but his colors are less aggressive and his subdued melancholy
    lends his images a different feel overall. Thanks to both Ibels and Lautrec,
    as Charles Saunier noted in <i>La Plume</i>, the poster, which had only been
    considered as attractive wall decoration, was being elevated to the higher
    status of a satirical and sociological vision. DFP-II 470, Reims 753, La

    "Georges Meunier was one of the painters of talent and charm . . . who are
    the smiling illustrators of their time. . . a pupil of Chéret . . . his
    philosophy of the poster was the same 'toujours les femmes et les rires'
    (Abdy p. 63). In this poster he clearly follows in Chéret's graphic
    footsteps, illustrating a charming, intimate scene in which an elegant young
    woman is smoking, while the black cat at her feet seems extremely curious -
    and probably impatient to play with the many packs of Job rolling paper on
    the floor. This image traditionally appears in a much larger format, with
    one image, rather than these two images side-by-side, presented within a
    decorative border formed out of the Job logo. <i>Rare</i>. Maitres pl. 167,

    "The Olympia opened in Paris in April of 1893 as the first establishment to
    call itself a 'music-hall' - a term borrowed from British vaudeville which
    soon made its way into French vocabulary. From the start, the Olympia
    exploited feminine allure for all it was worth; whatever its various revues
    were called, they always featured beautiful girls in revealing costumes . .
    . [Pal] was a perfect choice to create one of the Olympia's first show
    posters. His well-proportioned, realistically-drawn beauties projected a
    sensuality no other posterist could match" (Gold p. 112). The ladies are
    shown dancing on the British shore, with the Brighton Palace Pier in the
    background. The children, playing in the rain with their umbrellas, are
    perhaps a commentary on the British weather, but they also mimic the
    parasols held by the dancers. Maitres 35, Reims 929, Maindron 99, Gold 162,

    After early training as a painter, Codognato dedicated himself to
    advertising illustration. In 1904, he gained recognition with his design for
    the Verona Horse Fair and for the next 35 years he designed 150 posters. His
    style ranged from humorous images, comparable to works by Cappiello and
    Mauzan, to near-Futurist images of speeding cars and majestic automobiles.
    He was also closely associated with Fiat, for whom he designed a number of
    impressive images. This exceptional allegory is open to interpretation, but
    can be understood as showing Mercury attaching his own wings to a bicycle.
    Aside from its meaning, it is an extremely <i>rare</i> image, and a
    magnificent example of the realistic way that Italian graphic designers
    could combine classical allegories into contemporary advertising. Manifesto

    Norwegian-born Gulbransson spent some time in Paris before settling in
    Munich where he actively worked for the magazine <i>Simplicissimus</i> and
    occasionally designed posters. Another <i>Simplicissimus</i> artist, Thomas
    Theodor Heine, had already created a poster for the Zust automobile (using
    <i>Simplicissimus'</i> emblematic bulldog, which he, himself, had designed)
    and it was most likely through him that Gulbransson got this commission.
    Using his pure, minimalist style with flat colors, he creates a dynamic
    composition with the massive dark form of the car arriving at the top of a
    hill in a cloud of smoke and dust. The overall effect is a marvelous
    combination of masses of color and the interplay of light and shadow.

    Schnackenberg studied with Franz von Stuck at the academy in Munich, and
    through his travels was exposed to the work of Toulouse-Lautrec in Paris.
    The two artists shared a passion for depicting nightlife, cabarets and
    performers, yet Schnackenberg's theatrical vision was more attuned to the
    prevailing German mood than fin-de-siècle Paris. His posters are an
    incarnation of the extravagance, decadence and morbidity at the center of
    Weimar-era indulgences. Similarly to Toulouse-Lautrec in Paris,
    Schnackenberg left behind a visual gallery of the demimonde of Munich's
    nightlife; filled with weird performers and dancers. Schnackenberg also
    worked extensively on theatrical and costume design. This poster is a
    tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec's work, with elements of <i>Divan Japonais</i> -
    the elegant couple looking down at a performer on stage, a nod to <i>Jane
    Avril</i>, with the high-leg kicking can-can dancer, and to <i>Moulin
    Rouge</i>, in the people seen in silhouette. Unlike Toulouse-Lautrec, here
    the typography flows through the image like the performer. Encyclopedie de

    Late in 1922, Schwitters and van Doesburg planned a small tour around the
    Netherlands with a traveling Dada show in order to introduce local artists
    to their work. The initial evening had been scheduled for December 27, but
    Schwitters had problems with his passport and the first show wasn't held
    until January 10. In all, there were 17 separate performances in 8 different
    locations. The first event was held at the Haagsche Kunstkring in the Hague.
    The address of the venue is included in the poster's upper right corner
    ("Haagsche K.K. Binnenhof 8"). For subsequent performances in other
    locations, the poster was slightly changed; this address was removed and a
    small plug for van Doesburg's Dada magazine, Mécano, was added that read,
    "Abonnement Mécano F5 per Jaar." Otherwise, the two versions of the poster
    are identical. The poster has the event program and Dada slogans - presented
    in sophisticated disorder using different hand drawn typography and font
    sizes. "The poster's discordant appearance reflects the tenor of many Dada
    evenings" (moma.org/learn). Modern Poster p. 102, Avant Garde p. 38, Berman

  TYPESET: >-
    <i>Die Stadt Ohne Juden [The City Without Jews] </i> (1924), is an
    expressionist Austrian film by H.K. Breslauer, based on the novel of the
    same name by Hugo Bettauer. Although it was originally intended as a
    satirical novel (written by a progressive journalist and writer), responding
    to the brewing anti-Semitism of the 1920s, it eventually became a unsettling
    foreshadowing of what was yet to come in Europe. In the film, when the
    anti-Semitic Chancellor of the Christian Social Party comes to power, he
    passes a law forcing all Jews to leave the country. Following their
    departure, the country begins to experience cultural deficits, a suffering
    economy and unemployment. Eventually the Jews are brought back to Austria,
    and a parallel love story throughout the novel is also resolved. The film
    differs from the book in its "happier ending," with a plot twist that the
    whole story was actually a dream of an anti-Semite, meant to lessen the
    controversial impact of the movie. Also, the characters in the book could be
    identified as actual politicians, but this was altered in the film to avoid
    censorship. The film was shown in 1926 in Berlin, 1928 in NY, and in 1933,
    for the last time, in Amsterdam as a protest against Hitler. It then
    disappeared from the public eye until it was rediscovered in the early
    1990s, missing the final scene. The black and white sketch in this
    <i>rare</i> poster features a giant, ghastly figure forcing throngs of Jews
    onto the streets and out of the city. This featureless form, though created
    well before his rise to power, sports side-swept bangs eerily similar to
    Hitler's.

  TYPESET: >-
    The Bal Tabarin, a popular night club in Montmartre, was opened in 1904 by
    Auguste Bosc, a composer of some renown in Paris during the "gay nineties."
    The club made its reputation with the Belle Époque favorite, the cancan,
    continuing to perform it long after the First World War, when the craze had
    all but died elsewhere. In the mid-20s two retired dancers infused the club
    with new life by introducing the Charleston. The passage of time and the
    changing trends are all illustrated in a spectacular manner here, with three
    different women dancing three separate dances all melded into one image. One
    element is clear among all the different characters in this poster - each is
    exposing enough skin to tantalize the viewer to attend an event there. This
    is one of the most sophisticated compositions Colin designed, infused with
    incredible movements of the various arms and legs, and containing different
    layers, combining three images into one. Using only three colors, Colin pays
    a flamboyant tribute to the art of dancing and has created a classic image
    reflecting the energy of Paris during the Jazz Age. This is the smaller
    format. Colin 172, Paul Colin et les Spectacles 131, Weill 365, The Poster

    After studying in Lyon, Loupot fought in the First World War and was
    wounded. He returned from the front and settled in Lausanne, where his
    parents were living, and quickly began his successful career as a poster
    designer. Most of his work was for the fashion and luxury goods industries.
    His style, a combination of the high-profile Swiss School and his own light
    French touch, worked very well for the products he was asked to advertise.
    This poster epitomizes the sophistication that was his visual calling card.
    The elegant young woman, who has pulled a chocolate bar out of her bag,
    almost appears to be guiltily sneaking her indulgence. She is dressed in
    warm colors against a dark background, and through Loupot's unique handling
    of lithography, he has made the image and the typography appear to vibrate.

    The concept of "Pleasure Cruising," as opposed to using a steamship to

    Mediterranean tour that left Cuxhaven in 1891. While it is impossible to
    identify the ship on which these elegantly-attired travelers are enjoying a
    leisurely afternoon, the ship in the background is the <i>Deutschland</i> -
    the Hamburg America Line's only four-stacker, whose maiden voyage was in

    vessel's illustrious past (among other things, it was the <i>SS France</i>
    that carried the <i>Mona Lisa</i> in 1962 when the painting went on an
    American tour). The posters in this series each graphically harken back to

    Two Dukes, one grasping a document entitled "Land Revenues" plaintively 
    beseech an airman in a Bleriot XI soaring overhead to vacate "their air."
    This clever political poster for the Liberal Party was quite early to
    capitalize on the new-found technology of heavier-than-air flight. It was
    only in 1909 that Louis Bleriot flew one of these aircraft successfully over
    the English Channel for the first time. The figure flying overhead is David
    Lloyd George, a prominent figure in the Liberal Party and Chancellor of the
    Exchequer from 1908-1915. He went on to become Prime Minister in 1916. In
    1909, he had proposed a "People's Budget" - taxes on landowners and those
    with higher incomes (the nobility and aristocracy) in order to fund new
    social welfare initiatives. It was ultimately passed in 1910 and is
    considered to be the foundation of the modern welfare state.

    One of at least two posters made promoting this documentary about a

    smaller, vertical format piece (see Swann Sale 2467 Lot 298). The text on
    this poster explains that, "these remarkable pictures were taken by Ray A.
    Durem from the hydro-aeroplane of the noted aviator Robert G. Fowler under
    unusual difficulties. Fowler made a daring flight across the isthmus from
    the Pacific to the Atlantic, so far the only aviator to make the journey.
    Shortly afterward, President Wilson issued an Executive Order forbidding
    such flights under heavy penalty. The photographs made on this flight, in
    themselves a notable achievement in motion photography, are probably the
    only pictures that will ever be taken of the canal from the air except for
    purposes of war."

    Born in Whitechapel, London, Abram Games became one of Britain's foremost
    graphic artists. Largely self-taught, Games opened his studio in 1936 and
    before the war, was already designing posters for major clients such as
    Shell, The London Transport and The National Post-Office. In 1942, he was
    appointed the "Official War Poster Designer" at the War Office, in which
    capacity he created more than 100 posters, and became the key person for
    British war communication. In post-war Britain, competition between the
    different airlines was fierce, and so, the airline companies hired the best
    graphic designers in the field, such as F.K. Henrion, Ashley Havinden, and
    Abram Games, to help them advertise. At the time when Games was creating a
    series of posters for B.O.A.C., the trend among artists was not to
    illustrate the actual airplanes (as had been the style in the thirties) but
    instead to advertise the advantages of flying, such as saved travel time. In
    order to capture these concepts, the designers created beautiful, symbolic
    and surrealistically-inspired images that quite poetically captured the
    abstract concepts they were advertising. Here, an elaborate weathervane
    seems to indicate the B.O.A.C. can take you to any of the 6 continents, or
    anywhere the wind blows. It is unclear precisely how many designs Games made
    for this series, but they are all united by a Surrealist feel and a pale
    blue and green background with faint clouds. International Posters Annual

    Lewitt and Him were both born in Poland and met as young graphic designers.
    In 1933, they founded the Lewitt-Him studio and later immigrated to England
    in 1937. Deeply inspired by Surrealist painting, their work often played
    with words and images. They had an active and successful partnership
    designing propaganda posters during the war, and in the post-war years
    working on large campaigns for American Overseas Airways, the General Post
    Office, the London Underground and others. The two designers parted ways in

    discovered by Jean Signoret when he took control of advertising at Air
    France (Air France, p. 116). The artist's references to modern art were
    originally deemed too modern and unrelatable by the company's previous
    management. The series was published in 1981, but having been outshone in
    the press by the announcement of the new high speed train, it never received

    Villa Sara. Tomas Clodomiro de Arteaga, owner of the newspaper <i>La
    Nación</i>, commissioned the project from Spanish architect Emilio Boix y
    Merino. It was purchased from the Arteaga family in 1907 by the Italian
    businessman Jaime Giacomo Molfino, who acquired the adjacent land in order
    to expand the facilities and transform it into a hotel. The Palace Hotel
    operated until 1944. Eventually, the property was sold to the Uruguayan
    State and became the location of the Sanitation Directorate of the Ministry
    of Public Works. For a time, the building housed units of the Armed Forces,
    until it was finally demolished in the 1970s.

    High atop the chalk cliffs of this small town in Normandy, lies a golf
    course that was designed in 1908, regarded as having one of the most
    spectacular views in the world, especially from its 10th hole. On top of the
    distant cliffs is the Chapelle Notre Dame de la Garde and the monument
    erected to Nungesser and Coli, two aviators whose airplane disappeared in
    1927 as they attempted to make the first east-to-west Atlantic crossing.
    This motif of sporting equipment in repose in striking landscapes figures
    into several other well-known posters from the era, most notably in Pierre
    Commarmond's 1928 poster for Combloux. Galland studied at the École des
    Beaux-Arts and at the École des Arts Décoratifs and went on to work as an
    illustrator for Hachette. He specialized in children's publications but also
    designed posters as well as illustrations for other magazines. Although his
    poster work encompassed political propaganda and product advertising, he is
    best remembered for the bold colors and appealing designs of his travel
    posters. He received the Legion of Honor in 1933. Tennis p. 84.

  TYPESET: >-
    The development of Montauk in the mid-1920s was solely attributed to one
    rather extraordinary entrepreneur named Carl Fisher. Fisher almost
    single-handedly transformed Miami Beach into an international destination
    for America's wealthiest. In 1925, he turned his attention to Montauk, and
    purchased the entire area- almost 10,000 acres. His vision was singular: he
    would create "A Miami of the North," so the wealthy could live by his
    slogan, "Miami in the Winter, Montauk in the Summer." His vast plan included
    a 200-room luxury hotel (The Manor), golf courses, a boardwalk, facilities
    for tennis, polo, archery, and golf, fox hunting and much more. He also
    created a deep harbor for large yachts by blasting an opening from the
    freshwater Lake Montauk to the sea. We can date this poster between 1929 and
    1932 based on the following: on October 24, 1935, the <i>East Hampton Star
    Newspaper</i> reported that "The first deluxe Pullman Lounge Cars were put
    in service on the Long Island Railroad in 1929." Fisher was hit by intense
    financial difficulties after a hurricane struck his properties in Miami and
    then in the crash of 1929. By 1932, he was bankrupt and his empire had
    collapsed. This <i>rare</i> poster, a "Jazz Age" array of characters
    seemingly straight out of <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, is one of only a few
    known examples.

    Trained as an academic painter, Dupas' Neoclassicist style manifested itself
    in his memorable Mannerist imagery. His signature aesthetic featured
    extraordinary women with elongated necks in pastoral settings, employing
    sophisticated layers of shadow and minimal use of color. Dupas' work,
    quintessential of the refined and luxurious French Art Deco style, so
    captivated his contemporaries, that he was called upon to help decorate the
    interiors of many buildings, public spaces and a mural and glass work for
    the famed French ocean liner, <i>Normandie</i>. A visitor to Dupas' studio
    once noted a quotation from Voltaire pinned to wall: "Decadence is produced
    by doing things the easy way and by being lazy about doing them well, by
    being sated with beauty, and by a taste for the bizarre" (French Art Deco p.
    90). Plakat Kunst p. 120, Richmond p. 116.

    Skansen is an open-air museum and zoo in Stockholm, founded in 1891 by Artur
    Hazelius to celebrate everyday life in the provinces of Sweden before the
    age of industrialism. Fearing that the idyllic days of rural life would be
    forgotten, Hazelius shipped 150 traditional houses in pieces to the museum
    grounds to be rebuilt there. "Within the capital, Skansen was quickly
    established as an excursion over the day, the obvious choice for a free
    Sunday. In a way, the founder Artur Hazelius changed the whole idea of the
    attraction by marketing it to the tourist. The concept is now so established
    that the word Skansen means open-air museum in several languages, including
    Polish" (Sweden p. 115). Nyman designed a number of posters, although his
    largest client was Skansen. Here, he depicts the Solliden Restaurant. Sweden

    A Western painter, muralist and illustrator, Dixon created a lot of art and

    was a side trip organized by the railroad for travelers on the route to
    California. Passengers would leave the train and be taken by car "through
    Arizona's Salt River Valley made possible by construction of the Roosevelt
    Dam" (Zega p. 55). Dixon originally designed this image in 1927 for the
    cover of a brochure advertising the trail. "The Apache Indian posed against
    colorful, cubist cliffs . . . [has] plastic solidity and strong color
    relationships [that] give it a decidedly modern flavor" (Dixon p. 153).

    Hockney, who is admired and collected as a contemporary artist, made
    brilliant contributions to the world of opera, as a stage and costume
    designer. He also designed numerous posters. Beginning in 1975 with his work
    for Stravinksy's <i>The Rake's Progress</i>, until 1990 when he worked on
    <i>Turandot</i>, Hockney worked for the major opera houses. Among his most
    memorable productions were Mozart's <i>Magic Flute</i> and Wagner's
    <i>Tristan and Isolde</i>. His collaboration with the Metropolitan Opera on
    Eric Satie's <i>Parade</i> is best-represented by this poster. The image,
    with Hockney's neo-pop décor and costumes, showcases a juggler whose
    contortions fit eye-catchingly into the poster's elongated format. If the
    opera itself is not so popular, this image has become a classic. Hockney 94.

    Artist Rights Today (A.R.T., Inc.) was a collaborative effort of artists to
    reclaim legal rights to their work, specifically poster artists who produced
    advertisements for organizations like the Avalon Ballroom and Family Dog in
    the 1960s. These are three of four posters made for A.R.T., Inc. benefit
    events in the late 80s. The design of each poster was in itself a
    collaborative effort by five of the most famous and successful artists of
    the psychedelic era: Wes Wilson, Stanley Mouse, Alton Kelley, Rick Griffin
    and Victor Moscoso. Each poster in the series was printed both as a
    lithograph and as a limited-edition of 350 silkscreen prints. This is an
    example of the latter, more <i>rare</i> prints, hand-signed by each of the
    artists.
