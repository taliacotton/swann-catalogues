    An artist and innovator, Muybridge is known for being a pioneer of the
    motion picture. He moved the field of photography towards instantaneous
    photography by shortening exposure times, experimenting with chemicals to
    develop film, and developing a special shutter and electrical timer, which
    allowed him to capture sequences of people and animals in motion. His
    invention the zoopraxiscope, a projection device, was used to animate his
    image sequences, becoming a precursor to cinema.

    school. It seems incredible to me now, but she liked the drawings I was
    doing in the late 1960s, so she and I worked out a trade. I chose the
    “Tattooed Man,” and Diane was going to visit my studio and choose a work of
    mine. We never completed it, and a year after Diane died I acquired the
