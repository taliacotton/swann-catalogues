    version of a larger 1866-67 oil on canvas, now in a private collection. 
    Brown (1831-1913), the British-born American painter renowned for his genre
    scenes, customarily painted small paintings with similar themes and titles,
    not as studies for a larger work but as separate works to meet popular
    demand.  His paintings of both childhood  mischievousness and innocence were
    highly sought after by collectors.  The model in the current work also
    appears in Children of the Forest, an 1866 oil on canvas sold at Sotheby's,
    New York, March 28, 2018, lot 134.<br><br>We wish to thank Martha Hoppin for

    Cole's (1801-1848) oil painting The Voyage of Life: Youth, now in the
    collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington,
    D.C.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection, Birmingham,

    Institute, Utica, New York, October 5-December 15, 1985, page 11, catalogue
    number 9.<br><br>The Voyage of Life is a series of four paintings created by
    Cole in 1842, representing an allegory of the four stages of human life. 
    The paintings, Childhood, Youth, Manhood, and Old Age, depict a voyager who
    travels in a boat on a river through the mid-19th-century American
    wilderness.  In each painting the voyager rides the boat on the River of
    Life accompanied by a guardian angel.  The landscape, each reflecting one of
    the four seasons of the year, plays a significant role in conveying the
    story.  With each installment the boat's direction of travel is reversed
    from the previous picture.  In childhood, the infant glides from a dark cave
    into a rich, green landscape.  As a youth, the boy takes control of the boat
    and aims for a shining castle in the sky.  In manhood, the adult relies on
    prayer and religious faith to sustain him through rough waters and a
    threatening landscape.  Finally, the man becomes old, and the angel guides
    him to heaven across the waters of eternity.<br><br>The Voyage of Life was
    well received by both critics and the public; the United States was
    experiencing the religious revival sometimes known as the Second Great
    Awakening.  The four paintings were reproduced as engravings by James
    Smillie (1807–1885) after Cole's death and the engravings widely distributed
    in time for the Third Great Awakening, further bestowing the series the
    great prestige and popular acclaim it retains today.

    Oil on canvas.  158x218 mm; 6¼x8½ inches.  Signed in oil, lower right
    recto.<br><br>Provenance: Zabriskie Gallery, New York; Estate of Virginia M.
    Zabriskie.<br><br>Wyant (1836-1892) was an American landscape painter.  His
    early works belonged to the Hudson River School, with its direct pastoral
    narrative, but evolved into the moodier and more shadowy Tonalism.  After a
    stroke which paralyzed his right arm, he taught himself to paint with his
    left.  Born in Ohio, Wyant worked primarily in New York following his
    training, as well as several years in Cincinnati and Europe.  After his
    marriage in 1880, he began to spend most of his time in Keene Valley, New
    York.  He moved in 1889 to Arkville, New York (in the Catskills).  He
    frequently painted in the Adirondacks, which is likely represented in this
    view, as well as in the Catskills.  Wyant was only moderately appreciated
    during his lifetime, though after his death his works were eagerly sought
    for and are now in museums including the National Museum of American Art,
    Washington, D.C., the Brooklyn Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New
    York, the Toledo Museum of Art, the Tennessee State Museum, Nashville and
    the Dayton Art Institute.

    from Porthmadog to Blaenau Ffesiniog on a single track.  The line was
    constructed between 1833 and 1836 to transport raw materials to the port in
    Porthmadog.  The introduction of steam locomotives and passenger carriages
    in the 1860s allowed the railway to become more efficient and appealing to
    regional tourism.  Operations closed on the line in August 1946, though
    shortly thereafter, groups have been active in restoration of the railway,
    slowly reopening each station.

    the works in the Moore's Art Gallery, New York, auction in 1885 were
    replicas of pictures that La Farge had sold the previous year in his forced
    sale at the auctioneers Ortgies & Co., New York.  The artist considered
    making copies both a substitute for keeping works that he did not really
    want to sell and as a potential future source of income.  The current work
    is based on a watercolor sold in 1884 at Ortgies & Co. (W. 1880.14) that
    dates from 1880 according to the auction catalogue.  Both are based on
    drawings executed around 1865 as La Farge worked on illustrations for Henry
    Wadsworth Longfellow's The Skeleton in Armor, a ballad set in Newport, Rhode
    Island.  The backdrop represents Brenton's Cove, Newport, prominently
    featured in the poem.  La Farge's other drawings of the subject are now in
    the Bowdoin College Museum of Art, Brunswick, Maine, and the Addison Gallery
    of American Art, Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts.

    Rochester Arts and Crafts Society, was in charge of installing Stickley's
    famous, large 1903 Arts and Crafts exhibition in its Rochester venue, the
    Mechanics Institute.  Shortly after that Ellis moved to Syracuse, New York,

    "golden age" of Stickley's furniture.

    African-American Fine Art, Flint, Michigan; private collection,
    Chicago.<br><br>Born in Hartford, Connecticut, Porter (1847-1923) was a
    noted still life and floral painter.  Porter was active from 1865 to 1915,
    both in New York and Hartford.  In 1869, he was one of the first African
    Americans to study at the National Academy in New York.  He later settled in
    Hartford where he befriended his neighbor, the famous author Mark Twain. 
    Around 1881, after raising $1,000 from auctioning his paintings, Porter
    moved to Paris, where for approximately two years he enrolled at the École
    Nationale Superiéure des Arts Décoratifs before studying at the Académie
    Julian.  While he unsuccessfully attempted to show his work at the Salon,
    his still life paintings were infused with a realism greatly influenced by
    Henri Fantin-Latour (1836-1904) and by his experimentation with plein air
    painting.

    Estate of the artist, New York, with the blue ink stamp verso; private
    collection, New Jersey.<br><br>Davies (1862-1928) was a visionary modern
    artist and arts director, just as renowned for his instrumental role in
    organizing the Armory Show in 1913.  Davies was born in Utica, New York and
    showed artistic promise early on, studying with Dwight Williams, a local
    landscape painter in 1877.  Once Davies' family moved to Chicago in 1879, he
    attended classes at the Chicago Academy of Design and supported himself with
    commercial commissions.  He moved to New York in either 1885 or 1886 and
    attended the Art Students League and classes with the Gotham Art Students. 
    Davies worked and exhibited throughout the city, despite having moved to
    Congers, New York in the early 1890s.  In 1893, he made the first of his two
    trips to Europe with funding from patrons through the Macbeth Gallery.  The
    commute to New York and constant travel caused a rift between Davies and his
    wife, and in the early 1900s he started a secret second family with model
    Edna Potter in New York.<br><br>Rooted in poetic fantasy, Davies' works did
    not stylistically resemble his contemporaries known as "The Eight," though
    his work did appear at the Macbeth Gallery's controversial landmark
    exhibition in 1908.  Davies was active in the New York artist community and
    befriended several young progressive artists like Marsden Hartley
    (1877-1943) and Rockwell Kent (1882-1971).  It was in the capacity of
    president of the Association of American Painters and Sculptors that Davies
    worked with Walter Pach (1883-1958) to organize the Armory Show, pushing to
    include contemporary American artists. It was during this time that Davies
    changed from his Romantic style to one more inspired by Cubism.  He took on
    printmaking from 1917 to 1924, returning to his earlier style in his later
    years.

    York.<br><br>Born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Bricher (1837-1908) began
    his career as a businessman in Boston, Massachusetts.  He studied at the
    Lowell Institute alongside fellow artists Albert Bierstadt (1830-1902) and
    William Morris Hunt (1824-1879), and devoted himself to art professionally
    after 1858.  He focused on maritime paintings, with attention to scenes that
    explore the effect of light on both coastal landscapes and seascapes. 
    Following his move to New York in 1868, he became one of the last painters
    associated with the American Luminist movement, which came out of the Hudson
    River School.  Though little-known throughout his lifetime, Bricher's work
    gained more attention posthumously, and by the 1980s he came to be credited
    as one of the foremost American maritime painters of the 19th century.

    Chicago.<br><br>Bradford (1823-1892)  was an American romanticist painter,
    photographer and explorer, originally from Fairhaven, Massachusetts, near
    New Bedford.  He was a notable marine painter and was, along with his
    contemporaries Frederic Edwin Church (1826-1900) and Albert Bierstadt
    (1830-1902), among the first American painters to portray the frozen regions
    of the Arctic.  From 1861 to 1866 Bradford made excursions north to Labrador
    with Dr. Isaac Israel Hayes.  With funds provided by LeGrand Lockwood,
    Bradford traveled to Greenland in 1869, his farthest northern excursion,
    reaching eventually as far as 75° north latitude aboard the steamship
    Panther, accompanied by photographers John L. Dunmore and George
    Critcherson.  Thereafter, Bradford spent two years in London, promoting his
    explorations, and later in the 1870s established a studio in San Francisco
    and traveled extensively in the western United States where he painted
    Yosemite, Mariposa Valley and the mountains of the Sierra Nevada. 
    <br><br>Despite his far-reaching travels, focus on marine paintings and
    association with the American west, he was like his friend and fellow New
    Bedford transplant Albert Bierstadt, consistently associated with the Hudson
    River School, adopting their techniques and becoming highly interested in
    the way light touches water and how it affects the appearance of water
    surfaces and the general atmospherics of a painting.  In 1874, he was
    elected to join the National Academy of Design, New York.<br><br>Bradley
    Beach, the subject of the current work, is now a borough in Monmouth County,
    New Jersey, and became a seaside destination during the 1870s when several
    investors started its development.  It was the first location in the United
    States to charge sea bathers for beach access when it began minting its own
    tin badges starting in 1929.

    purchased Martin Diamond Fine Arts, New York, 1976, by private collection,
    New York; thence by descent to current owner, private collection, New
    York.<br><br>Davies (1862-1928) was a visionary modern artist and arts
    director, just as remembered for his instrumental role in organizing the
    Armory Show in 1913.  Davies was born in Utica, New York and showed artistic
    promise early on, studying with Dwight Williams, a local landscape painter
    in 1877.  Once Davies' family moved to Chicago in 1879, he attended classes
    at the Chicago Academy of Design and supported himself with commercial
    commissions.  He moved to New York in either 1885 or 1886 and attended the
    Art Students League and classes with the Gotham Art Students.  Davies worked
    and exhibited throughout the city, despite having moved to Congers, New York
    in the early 1890s.  In 1893, he made the first of his two trips to Europe
    with funding from patrons through the Macbeth Gallery.  The commute to New
    York and constant travel caused a rift between Davies and his wife, and in
    the early 1900s he started a secret second family with model Edna Potter in
    New York. <br><br>Rooted in poetic fantasy, Davies' works did not
    stylistically resemble his contemporaries known as "The Eight," though his
    work did appear at the Macbeth Gallery's controversial landmark exhibition
    in 1908.  Davies was active in the New York artist community and befriended
    several young progressive artists like Marsden Hartley and Rockwell Kent. 
    It was in the capacity of president of the Association of American Painters
    and Sculptors that Davies worked with Walter Pach to organize the Armory
    Show, pushing to include contemporary American artists.  It was during this
    time that Davies changed from his Romantic style to one more inspired by
    Cubism.  He took on printmaking from 1917 to 1924, returning to his earlier
    style in his later years.

    Lockwood de Forest, Candace Wheeler and Samuel Colman.  Tiffany designed
    stained glass windows and lamps, glass mosaics, blown glass, ceramics,

    Tiffany started out as a painter, but became interested in glassmaking from
    about 1875 and worked at several glasshouses in Brooklyn between then and
    1878.

    illustration at the Correspondence School of Illustrating at 114 West
    Thirty-fourth Street.  His parents had not objected to his becoming an

    Julian for a brief period, however most of his time abroad was spent
    observing other cultures and recording his travels in his artwork.  While he
    received some academic training and observed the emergent modern art
    movements in Paris, his style remained rooted in American tendencies.  His
    works from this time are particularly reminiscent of the Ashcan School and
    their propensity to record a living experience.  This work, one of

    Pennell’s (1857-1926) work with its often impressionistic line, but the
    artist often chose a modern subject.  Born in Pennsylvania, Pennell made
    London his home and did not return full-time to the United States until
    World War I.  He traveled twice to New York prior to that, in 1904 and 1908,
    and captured the changing character of the city with the growing number of
    skyscrapers, a reflection of his interest in depicting modern life through
    urban landscapes, factories and industry.

    Jack Tanzer Gallery, New York, with the label; private collection, New
    Jersey.<br><br>Davies (1862-1928) was a visionary modern artist and arts
    director, just as remembered for his instrumental role in organizing the
    Armory Show in 1913.  Davies was born in Utica, New York and showed artistic
    promise early on, studying with Dwight Williams, a local landscape painter
    in 1877.  Once Davies' family moved to Chicago in 1879, he attended classes
    at the Chicago Academy of Design and supported himself with commercial
    commissions.  He moved to New York in either 1885 or 1886 and attended the
    Art Students League and classes with the Gotham Art Students.  Davies worked
    and exhibited throughout the city, despite having moved to Congers, New York
    in the early 1890s.  In 1893, he made the first of his two trips to Europe
    with funding from patrons through the Macbeth Gallery.  The commute to New
    York and constant travel caused a rift between Davies and his wife, and in
    the early 1900s he started a secret second family with model Edna Potter in
    New York. <br><br>Rooted in poetic fantasy, Davies' works did not
    stylistically resemble his contemporaries known as "The Eight," though his
    work did appear at the Macbeth Gallery's controversial landmark exhibition
    in 1908.  Davies was active in the New York artist community and befriended
    several young progressive artists like Marsden Hartley and Rockwell Kent. 
    It was in the capacity of president of the Association of American Painters
    and Sculptors that Davies worked with Walter Pach to organize the Armory
    Show, pushing to include contemporary American artists.  It was during this
    time that Davies changed from his Romantic style to one more inspired by
    Cubism.  He took on printmaking from 1917 to 1924, returning to his earlier
    style in his later years.

    of the Santa Fe Railway and to stimulate tourism to the American Southwest,
    Cincinnati-born Potthast (1857-1927), along with four other prominent
    American artists (Thomas Moran, Elliott Daingerfield, Frederick B. Williams,
    De Witt Parshall), was invited by the Railway to journey to the Grand Canyon
    to recreate on canvas the unique experience of its landscape.  This was
    Potthast's first visit to the Grand Canyon and of significant importance for
    the artist.  Potthast would go on to exhibit his depictions of the Grand
    Canyon at the National Academy of Design in New York in 1911, 1918 and
    1920.  Potthast's devotion to the Southwest would also lead him to become a
    founder of a group called the Society of Men Who Paint the Far West, which
    included several of the artists who accompanied Potthast on the 1910
    painting excursion.

    of several prominent women associated with the artistic life of Cincinnati
    at the turn of the century, Sykes (1855-1931) specialized in colorful,
    Impressionist-inspired watercolors. She was born in Brookline,
    Massachusetts; her father was a silversmith and engraver, and her mother was
    a gifted needleworker. Stimulated by the artistic example of her parents,
    Sykes studied at the Lowell Institute in Boston in 1875 and enrolled at the
    school of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1878. She married in 1882and moved with
    her husband to Cincinnati, at that time a flourishing cultural center dubbed
    the "Queen City of the West." In order to refine her artistic skills, she
    enrolled at the Cincinnati Art Academy in 1884. Throughout the next decade,
    she continued her training under such notable American painters as Frank
    Duveneck and Thomas Satterwhite Noble. Although she occasionally worked in
    oil, watercolor became Sykes' favorite medium of expression.<br><br>She was
    a regular contributor to the annual exhibitions of the Boston Art Club, New
    York Watercolor Club, Art Institute of Chicago, the Philadelphia Water Color
    Club and the Ohio Water Color Society. In 1892, she became a charter member
    of the Woman's Art Club of Cincinnati. Over a three-decade-long period,
    Sykes exhibited at the Cincinnati Art Museum on forty-two occasions.

    1918 to 1938). In 1920, he exhibited at the Société Anonyme alongside
    Hartley and Joseph Stella (1877-1946). Despite local and international
    recognition, Walkowitz was not nearly as well-known as his contemporaries.

    (1869-1954) and Henri Rousseau (1844-1910). By the time Walkowitz returned
    to New York, his style was heavily influenced by European Modernism, with

    modernism. Stieglitz was so impressed by the young artist, that he sent him
    to study art in Greece, Italy and North Africa in 1914. His style became

    perspective and powerful use of color.  Lie became known for colorful
    impressionistic scenes of harbors and coves, painted during the many summers

    and raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina. In 1880 at the age of 21, he
    moved to New York and studied at the National Academy of Design and the Art
    Students League.  Within a year, he was teaching life study classes and had
    discovered the work of the French Barbizon painters, who would influence his
    work for the rest of his career.  He also became friendly with notable
    painters George Inness (1825-1894), Kenyon Cox (1856-1919) and Walter
    Satterlee (1844-1908), who greatly influenced Daingerfield.  For the next
    several years, he studied under Satterlee and taught in his still-life
    classes.<br><br>In 1886, he was mesmerized by the mountains of North
    Carolina and subsequently he would spend most summers for the remainder of
    his life in Blowing Rock.  In New York, Daingerfield was exhibited
    frequently, including in exhibitions at the National Academy of Design and
    the Salmagundi Club.  In 1910, he was commissioned by the Santa Fe Railroad
    to paint scenes of the Grand Canyon.  He traveled west again a couple of
    years later, this time with his family, in 1912, to paint additional Western
    landscapes.  One of these, Trees on the Canyon Rim, was exhibited at the
    Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C.  Both his western landscapes and his
    religious scenes were highly sought after by contemporary
    collectors.<br><br>Daingerfield’s paintings are in numerous prominent public

    September 15-November 30, 2006.<br><br>Demuth (1883-1935) was born in
    Lancaster, Pennsylvania and suffered an injury as a child that forced him to
    walk with a cane.  As he was unable to be as physically active as other
    children, his mother gave him crayons to draw with.  His parents supported
    his art from a young age and he attended Franklin and Marshall College,
    Drexel University and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia. 
    After leaving school, he focused on his preferred medium of watercolor and
    found inspiration in flowers and plants in his mother's garden, a subject
    that would preoccupy him throughout his life.<br><br>Demuth made his studio
    at his home in Lancaster, but traveled frequently and made many important
    friends in the artistic community.  He traveled three times to Paris where
    he studied at the Académie Colarossi and Académie Julian, joined the
    avant-garde artistic scene, and admired the work of European modernists,
    even spending time at Gertrude Stein's salon.  He met Marsden Hartley while
    in Paris who later introduced him to Alfred Stieglitz and became part of his
    tightknit group of artists.<br><br>Demuth spent several summers at the
    artists' colony at Provincetown, Massachusetts, during the mid-1910s and, in
    1914, exhibited his watercolors in the Provincetown studio of modernist
    painter, E. Ambrose Webster.

    Watercolor on cream wove paper.  245x350 mm; 9¾x13¾ inches.  Signed in
    pencil, lower left recto.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection,
    Baltimore.<br><br><br><br>Davies (1862-1928) was a visionary modern artist
    and arts director, just as remembered for his instrumental role in
    organizing the Armory Show in 1913.  Davies was born in Utica, New York and
    showed artistic promise early on, studying with Dwight Williams, a local
    landscape painter in 1877.  Once Davies' family moved to Chicago in 1879, he
    attended classes at the Chicago Academy of Design and supported himself with
    commercial commissions.  He moved to New York in either 1885 or 1886 and
    attended the Art Students League and classes with the Gotham Art Students. 
    Davies worked and exhibited throughout the city, despite having moved to
    Congers, New York in the early 1890s.  In 1893, he made the first of his two
    trips to Europe with funding from patrons through the Macbeth Gallery.  The
    commute to New York and constant travel caused a rift between Davies and his
    wife, and in the early 1900s he started a secret second family with model
    Edna Potter in New York. <br><br>Rooted in poetic fantasy, Davies' works did
    not stylistically resemble his contemporaries known as "The Eight," though
    his work did appear at the Macbeth Gallery's controversial landmark
    exhibition in 1908.  Davies was active in the New York artist community and
    befriended several young progressive artists like Marsden Hartley and
    Rockwell Kent.  It was in the capacity of president of the Association of
    American Painters and Sculptors that Davies worked with Walter Pach to
    organize the Armory Show, pushing to include contemporary American artists. 
    It was during this time that Davies changed from his Romantic style to one
    more inspired by Cubism.  He took on printmaking from 1917 to 1924,
    returning to his earlier style in his later years.

    such as the Downtown Gallery, the Daniel Gallery and the Whitney Studio Club
    (of which she was a founding member and where she had her first solo

    André Emmerich Gallery, Inc., New York, with the label and ink stamp; Mark
    Borghi Fine Art, Inc., New York, with the label; private collection, New
    York.<br><br>Graham's significant, influential career of four decades was
    marked by reinvention and a commitment to his vision of the endless
    possibilities of American Art.  Born Ivan Dabrowsky in Kiev, Graham was a
    law student and a czarist soldier in the 1917 revolution. After imprisonment
    and the downfall of Nicholas II, Graham left Russia and arrived in the
    United States in 1920.  Though it is unclear if he showed artistic
    inclination in Russia, Graham recreated himself as an art student in New
    York.  He attended the Art Students League from 1922 to 1924, where he
    studied under John Sloan (1871-1951).  In a meteoric rise to recognition,
    Graham's first solo museum exhibition was organized by Duncan Philips in
    1929.<br><br>Like many early career artists, Graham traveled to Paris and he
    came under the influence of the Surrealists and their psychoanalytical
    approach, however he remained dedicated to his mission of creating a new
    American Art. Along with Stuart Davis (1892-1964) and Arshile Gorky
    (1904-1948), Graham would provide a foundation for American Modernism and
    would be sought out by a new generation of the New York School (his
    watershed 1937 treatise, System and Dialectics of Art had advanced the
    Abstract Expressionist movement).<br><br>During the 1940s, Graham departed
    from his post-Cubist style, and adopted a new loosened, abstract style.  At
    this time, he served as a mentor to younger artists such as Jackson Pollock,
    Willem de Kooning and Arshile Gorky, whose works would shape the Abstract
    Expressionist movement.  Graham was also considered influential to Lee
    Krasner, David Smith, Dorothy Dehner, and Mark Rothko.<br><br>In his mature
    career, he found inspiration in Old Master works and he approached his
    canvases with a measure of dignity and mysticism.  His portraits are
    powerful, standing out boldly from their flattened back drops. 
    Simultaneously, Graham conveyed a delicate luminosity and vulnerability; his
    courtesans' askew eyes act to ground the figure in a plane between fantasy
    and reality.  This merging of worlds characterizes not only Graham's work
    but also his storied, monumental life.

    modern American artist who, along with Stanton Macdonald-Wright (1890-1973),
    was the founder of Synchromism, a provocative style of abstract painting
    that dates from around 1912 to the 1920s.  Russell's "synchromies," which
    analogized color to music, were an early American contribution to the rise
    of Modernism.  Synchromism was an early innovation in pure abstraction,
    which was developed primarily by Russell with contributions from Stanton
    Macdonald-Wright.  Other American painters in Paris, where Russell had moved
    in 1911, who were experimenting with Synchromism at the time included Thomas
    Hart Benton, Andrew Dasburg, and Patrick Henry Bruce, all of whom were
    friends with Russell and Macdonald-Wright.  Bruce was also friendly with
    Sonia and Robert Delaunay, proponents of Orphism (a term coined in 1912 by
    the poet Guillaume Apollinaire), another contemporaneous art movement
    centered around color and abstraction.

    Zabriskie.<br><br>Walkowitz (1878-1965) was born in Tyumen, Siberia to
    Jewish parents and immigrated to the Lower East Side of New York with his
    mother in 1889. He was trained in the academic style at the National Academy
    of Design, New York, and also at the Académie Julian in Paris, though his
    style was most influenced by his experiences outside of the studio.  In
    Paris, Walkowitz was also impressed by the landmark 1907 Paul Cézanne
    (1839-1906) retrospective exhibit at the Salon d'Automne and by his
    introduction to the work of Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and Henri Rousseau
    (1844-1910). By the time Walkowitz returned to New York, his style was
    heavily influenced by European Modernism, with emphasis on gestures,
    simplified forms and flat planes of bold color. His first solo exhibition
    was held at Haas Gallery, the back of a modest frame shop, in New York in
    1908.<br><br>In 1912, Walkowitz met Albert Stieglitz (1864-1946) through
    Marsden Hartley (1877-1943) and became involved with 291, Stieglitz's New
    York gallery, which served as a hub of American modernism. Stieglitz was so
    impressed by the young artist, that he sent him to study art in Greece,
    Italy and North Africa in 1914. His style became more abstract; its reduced
    linear forms lent themselves to the city's rush skyward, prematurely
    anticipating the New York School and the Abstract Expressionists.<br><br>In
    1913, Walkowitz was represented at the Armory Show and in the 1916 Forum
    exhibition. Walkowitz was concerned with politics and artists' rights and
    was active in various artist's groups, founding the People's Art Guild and
    the Society of Independent Artists (he became director of the latter from
    1918 to 1938). In 1920, he exhibited at the Société Anonyme alongside
    Hartley and Joseph Stella (1877-1946). Despite local and international
    recognition, Walkowitz was not nearly as well-known as his contemporaries.
    Walkowitz painted into the 1940s, when his eyesight began to fail.

    make frequent trips to the Monterey Peninsula and, in 1934, he was granted
    membership to the Carmel-by-the-Sea artist’s cooperative.  The president of
    the cooperative, Armin Hansen (1886-1957) had been in the 1906 class at
    California School of Design with McGlynn and invited him to join the group
    of plein air painters in Monterey.  Despite his dedication to teaching,
    McGlynn and his wife could not resist the offer and soon bought a home in
    Pebble Beach.  For several years, the family made the trip on weekends and
    eventually they moved permanently to Monterey.  McGlynn's impressionistic
    landscape paintings capture the unique light of the Pacific Coast with pure
    and radiant color.

    inches.  Signed and titled in pencil, upper left recto.<br><br>Provenance:
    Zabriskie Gallery, New York, with the label; private collection, New
    York.<br><br>Graham's significant, influential career of four decades was
    marked by reinvention and a commitment to his vision of the endless
    possibilities of American Art.<br><br>Born Ivan Dabrowsky in Kiev, Graham
    was a law student and a czarist soldier in the 1917 revolution. After
    imprisonment and the downfall of Nicholas II, Graham left Russia and arrived
    in the United States in 1920. Though it is unclear if he showed artistic
    inclination in Russia, Graham recreated himself as an art student in New
    York. He attended the Art Students League from 1922 to 1924, where he
    studied under John Sloan (1871-1951). In a meteoric rise to recognition,
    Graham's first solo museum exhibition was organized by Duncan Philips in
    1929.<br><br>Like many early career artists, Graham traveled to Paris and he
    came under the influence of the Surrealists and their psychoanalytical
    approach, however he remained dedicated to his mission of creating a new
    American Art. Along with Stuart Davis (1892-1964) and Arshile Gorky
    (1904-1948), Graham would provide a foundation for American Modernism and
    would be sought out by a new generation of the New York School (his
    watershed 1937 treatise, System and Dialectics of Art had advanced the
    Abstract Expressionist movement).<br><br>During the 1940s, Graham departed
    from his post-Cubist style, and adopted a new loosened, abstract style. At
    this time, he served as a mentor to younger artists such as Jackson Pollock,
    Willem de Kooning and Arshile Gorky, whose works would shape the Abstract
    Expressionist movement. Graham was also considered influential to Lee
    Krasner, David Smith, Dorothy Dehner, and Mark Rothko.<br><br>In his mature
    career, he found inspiration in Old Master works and he approached his
    canvases with a measure of dignity and mysticism. His portraits are
    powerful, standing out boldly from their flattened back drops.
    Simultaneously, Graham conveyed a delicate luminosity and vulnerability; his
    courtesans' askew eyes act to ground the figure in a plane between fantasy
    and reality. This merging of worlds characterizes not only Graham's work but
    also his storied, monumental life.

    Arthur B. Davies, New York, 1928-30, with stamp twice on the frame back;
    private collection, New York.<br><br>According to Judith Zilczer, in her
    article "Arthur B. Davies: The Artist as Patron," appearing in The American
    Art Journal, Summer 1987, Davies (1862-1928) had first purchased a sketch by
    Maurer (1868-1932) in April 1909 from Alfred Stieglitz's 291 in New York. 
    Davies continued to support artists in Stieglitz's circle, including Marsden
    Hartley (1877-1943).<br><br>The current work is an example of Maurer's
    technique of painting on his "made" canvases.  Seeking to emulate the Old
    Masters, Maurer began to experiment with materials in the early 1900s.  To
    create the "made" canvas, Maurer stretched linen (or other fabric scrap)
    over a wood frame and cardboard, coated it with glue and set it with dental
    plaster.  Elizabeth McCausland opined that Maurer intended these works to
    appear filmy, dingey, and spotted with "freckles" under the layer of gesso,
    only eliciting more outcries from his conservative detractors.  Maurer
    adopted his "made" canvas technique in his Paris years and continued the
    practice after returning to America in 1914.<br><br> Maurer's first
    paintings in his so-called "Girl" series debuted in 1921 at the Salon of
    Independent Artists, New York.  These long-necked women are often mistakenly
    attributed to the influence of Amedeo Modigliani.  Given that the reference
    frames of the artists' careers do not match up, McCausland wrote that
    instead, Maurer was more likely inspired by Botticelli's Venuses with
    elongated necks.  Since Modigliani's works did not reach the  United States
    until 1920, McCausland wrote empathetically, "Let Maurer have the last word
    in the controversy.  'Who is this man Modigliani?' he is often quoted as
    asking."

    American artist returning from Paris in the first decade of the 20th
    century, Weber (1881-1961), an avid student of art history who possessed a
    critical eye for the avant-garde, skillfully incorporated the new directions
    of French modern art into his work.  Weber absorbed the primitivism of his
    good friend, the self-taught artist Henri Rousseau, the early Cubism of
    Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso and the Fauvism of Henri Matisse and Émile
    Othon Frieze.<br><br>Born in Poland and emigrating to Brooklyn at the age of
    ten, Weber studied at the Pratt Institute under pioneering modernist
    teacher, Arthur Wesley Dow, who was also an important influence on Weber as
    an accomplished printmaker and painter himself.  In the early 1920s, Weber
    traveled to Paris just in time to view a major Paul Cézanne retrospective,
    as well as visit Gertrude Stein’s artistic salon and take classes at
    Matisse’s private academy.  Weber worked in singular modern style throughout
    most of his career and influenced many following generations of American
    artists.

    arts director, just as remembered for his instrumental role in organizing
    the Armory Show in 1913.  Davies was born in Utica, New York and showed
    artistic promise early on, studying with Dwight Williams, a local landscape
    painter in 1877.  Once Davies' family moved to Chicago in 1879, he attended
    classes at the Chicago Academy of Design and supported himself with
    commercial commissions.  He moved to New York in either 1885 or 1886 and
    attended the Art Students League and classes with the Gotham Art Students. 
    Davies worked and exhibited throughout the city, despite having moved to
    Congers, New York in the early 1890s.  In 1893, he made the first of his two
    trips to Europe with funding from patrons through the Macbeth Gallery.  The
    commute to New York and constant travel caused a rift between Davies and his
    wife, and in the early 1900s he started a secret second family with model
    Edna Potter in New York. <br><br>Rooted in poetic fantasy, Davies' works did
    not stylistically resemble his contemporaries known as "The Eight," though
    his work did appear at the Macbeth Gallery's controversial landmark
    exhibition in 1908.  Davies was active in the New York artist community and
    befriended several young progressive artists like Marsden Hartley and
    Rockwell Kent.  It was in the capacity of president of the Association of
    American Painters and Sculptors that Davies worked with Walter Pach to
    organize the Armory Show, pushing to include contemporary American artists. 
    It was during this time that Davies changed from his Romantic style to one
    more inspired by Cubism.  He took on printmaking from 1917 to 1924,
    returning to his earlier style in his later years.

    Sommer returned to New York. Influenced by early German Expressionism,
    Sommer joined the American Kit Kat Club, which provided life drawing models,
    akin to the Whitney Studio Club. In 1907 Sommer followed his printmaking
    work to the Otis Lithography Company in Cleveland, where he began a
    friendship with William Zorach and founded the Kokoon Art Club. In 1914,
    Sommer and his wife Martha purchased their property in Brandywine where he
    set up his studio in an old schoolhouse, working as an artist, muralist, and
    theater production designer. Finding himself without work during the Great
    Depression, Sommer worked first under the auspices of the Public Works of
    Art Project, the Works Progress Administration, and then the Treasury Art
    Project, the most notable project being a mural he completed for Brett Hall
    in the Cleveland Public Library.

  TYPESET: >-
    Oil on canvas, circa 1935.  205x255 mm; 8x10 inches.  Signed in oil, lower

    Angeles by Lee D. Witkin, New York, circa 1980; Evelyne Z. Daitz, New York;
    thence to the Estate of Evelyne Z. Daitz, New York. <br><br>Klitgaard
    (1893-1977) was born in Spuyten Duyvil, New York and studied at Barnard
    College and the National Academy of Design.  In 1933, she traveled to Europe
    on a Guggenheim Fellowship.  Upon her return, she was employed by the
    Federal Arts Project and worked as a mural painter based in Bearsville, New
    York, near Woodstock.  She became a part of the artists' colony in the area,
    which included artists Ernest Fiene and Katherine Schmidt, among others. 
    Also a member of the Whitney Studio Club, Klitgaard received a solo
    exhibition there in March 1927, followed by appearances at successive
    Whitney Biennial exhibitions.  <br><br>Klitgaard was known for capturing the
    seasonal changes in local landscapes and natural phenomena such as mountain
    mists, sunrises, and budding fruit trees.  Aside from what was described as
    "a woman's interpretation of the earth," by Art Digest in 1941, Klitgaard
    was also an accomplished painter of cityscapes and portraits.  During her
    heyday in the late 1930s and 1940s, her œuvre appeared to draw influences
    from Peter Bruegel as well as Chinese scroll paintings and was greatly
    admired by critics who reviewed her several exhibitions at Rehn Galleries,
    New York.  Lloyd Goodrich wrote that, "her details are all living, and the
    whole picture is pulled together by a lively sense of movement and a feeling
    for light and air... with a sort of cool detached lyricism, a feeling for
    the sharpness of autumn air... mobile, graceful, spirited." <br><br>During
    her career, Klitgaard received numerous awards for her work, including the
    Jennie Sesnan Gold Medal in the 128th Annual Exhibition of the Pennsylvania
    Academy of Fine Arts in 1933, honorable mention for landscape in the 49th
    Annual American Exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1938, and she
    was included in the New York World's Fair Exhibition, "American Art Today,"
    presenting her "immaculately painted landscape," In the Winter Sun.

    Yvonne Pryor," Chicago Daily News, July 1, 1939 (illustrated). 
    <br><br>Pryor (1884-1977) was born in Chicago to French American parents
    traveling from New Orleans.  She was raised between the two cities and
    attended the Kenwood Institute in Chicago and received artistic training at
    the Art Institute of Chicago and l'École des Beaux-Arts in Paris.  After her
    return to Chicago, Pryor studied architectural design with Louis J. Millet
    and specialized in stained glass.  Later, her career expanded to include
    jewelry and textile design.  She exhibited her paintings through the 1930s
    and 1940s, at the Art Institute of Chicago and Findlay Galleries, Chicago. 
    In the fall of 1941, Pryor showed her work at the Riverside Museum in New
    York in an exhibition by members of the Chicago Society of Artists.  In
    1952, she was made a director of the Society.  <br><br>Painted in the midst
    of the Great Depression, Shut Down shows a desolate shuttered factory devoid
    of human presence. It is characteristic of Pryor's Constructivist style as
    well as testifies to her prowess in geometry and mathematics.

    representations of everyday life and her satirical caricatures.  She studied
    at the Art Students League, New York, with Kenneth Hayes Miller, John Sloan
    and George Bellows, and taught herself drypoint there in between drawing
    classes.  Looking back at her time at the League, Bacon said, "The years at
    the Art Students League were a very important chunk of life to me and very
    exhilarating.  It was the first time in my life, of course, that I had met
    and gotten to know familiarly a group of young people who were all headed
    the same way with the same interests.  In fact it was practically
    parochial."  From the 1910s to the  1930s, she worked mainly in drypoint
    printmaking and also doing illustrations for the satirical magazine Bad
    News, while her later drawings appeared as illustrations in publications
    including The New Yorker, New Republic, Fortune and Vanity Fair.  She
    further went on to illustrate over 60 books, 19 of which she also
    wrote.<br><br>Bacon exhibited frequently in New York from the 1910s onward,
    with galleries including Alfred Stieglitz's Intimate Gallery, the Weyhe
    Gallery and the Downtown Gallery (she had more than 32 solo exhibitions
    during her career), and was closely connected with other artists with ties
    to these galleries, including Katherine Schmidt and Yasuo Kuniyoshi.

    collection, Chicago.<br><br>Stella (1877-1946) was born to a middle-class
    family in Muro Lucano, Italy.  He moved to New York in 1896 to study
    medicine, but he quickly eschewed his medical ambitions when he discovered
    his passion for art, enrolling at the Art Students League and studying at
    the New York School of Art under William Merritt Chase (1849-1916).  Stella
    worked as an illustrator from 1905 to 1908 and was also active in the
    Federal Art Project during the 1930s, however it is his avant-garde works
    for which he is today best known, including colorful, fanciful floral
    studies, like the current work, ethereal landscapes, and modernist city
    depictions.  His Futurist oil painting Battle of Lights, Coney Island, Mardi
    Gras, 1913, was exhibited in the 1913 Armory Show and caused a sensation. 
    Collector and art educator Katherine Dreier included Stella among those
    artists whose work she sought to promote under the auspices of her Société
    Anonyme, New York's first museum dedicated exclusively to advanced
    contemporary art, which opened its doors in 1920 (she acquired Battle of
    Lights, Coney Island, Mardi Gras and it is now in the collection of the Yale
    University Art Gallery, New Haven).  Like contemporary New York artists
    including John Marin (1870-1953) and Edward Hopper (1882-1967), Stella
    became fascinated with the geometric quality of the architecture of Lower
    Manhattan.  During the 1920s he also began to make collages consisting of
    scraps of discarded paper, wrappers (some with the commercial logo or label
    still visible), and other bits of urban debris.  Stella's works from the
    1920s onward, however, were problematic for the cultivation of a sustained
    career.  Once he had ceased painting in a Futurist or quasi-Cubist mode and
    had finished with his period of Precisionist factory images (circa 1920), he
    was not aligned with any particular movement.  Even his retrospective at the
    Newark Museum, New Jersey in 1939 failed to reestablish him and his work was
    underappreciated at mid-century prior to being prized again in recent
    decades.

    close friend, in New York, on his mural for the French Line passenger ship
    company and again privately on another mural.   Léger introduced her to
    Herbert Matter (1907-1984), the Swiss graphic designer and photographer whom
    she married in 1939.   She was a formative member of the American Abstract
    Artists and after working for the WPA in the late 1930s, Matter became

    Pollock (1912-1956), Lee Krasner (1908-1984), Philip Guston (1913-1980),
    Elaine de Kooning (1918-1989) and Willem de Kooning (1904-1997). Matter was
    a driving force behind the creation of the New York Studio School in 1964,

    headline-grabbing experimentation.

    Contrathemis was created with stop-motion animation from more than 4,000
    original drawings, like the present work. The drawings were individually
    photographed and put in order by the artist and synchronized to lighting
    effects created by colorized car headlights. Grant's use of the film medium
    allowed him to explore the potential of shapes and color put into motion. 
    Contrathemis, supported by Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) and the Guggenheim
    Foundation, was the most notable, ground-breaking project of Grant's, of the
    several important avant-garde films he made between 1938 and 1941.  The
    Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C., holds the drawing
    “Contrathemis”, Frame 2401 which was used close in sequence to the present

    into his work in 1934, the figures often overwhelmed by whirring scenes

    from the point of view of a spectator looking down on the abstracted figures
    in the rings.  While Marin's 1930s circus scenes contained hapless clowns
    and acrobats, usually disrobed in some form, his later works on the theme
    feature just a suggestion of human presence in a looser, more spontaneous
    style.

  TYPESET: >-
    Color pastels and pen and ink on card, circa 1950.  153x227 mm; 6x9 inches. 
    Signed and titled in ink, verso.  <br><br>Provenance: Private collection,
    New Jersey.<br><br>After attending the Canadian Royal Academy of Arts,
    Ontario and working as an artist in Montreal, Benjamin (1899-1985) moved to
    New York in 1923 and attended classes at the Art Students League, Cooper
    Union, and the Educational Alliance Art School while working as a commercial
    artist for the New York Sun newspaper, where he would work for the next 25
    years.  Benjamin received instruction from Joseph Pennell, John Sloan and
    Yasuo Kuniyoshi and became close friends with Milton and Sally Avery.  As
    part of the artist circle surrounding Avery and the studios in the Lincoln
    Arcade, a building at 65th Street and Broadway later torn down to build
    Lincoln Center, Benjamin became acquainted with French modernists such as
    Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia as well as other New York artists
    including Stuart Davis and Mark Rothko.  Benjamin's formal training and his
    close association with French and American modernists created a
    stylistically blended œuvre that incorporated minute details with dynamic,
    sweeping lines and colors, which became more abstract as his career
    progressed.  During the Great Depression, Benjamin moved from Lincoln Arcade
    to East 59th Street, though still kept close ties with the Avery family,
    accompanying them to Gloucester, Massachusetts during the summers.  Rather
    than appeasing critics who called for a thoroughly American art genre to be
    consumed by the masses, Benjamin held to his idea that art should convey
    personal emotions and feelings rather than conforming to a strict dogma as
    in Social Realism, though he painted much of the same subjects.

    Jersey.<br><br>Wiegand (1896-1983) was a New York based abstract painter,
    writer, collector, benefactor and art critic.  She started to paint in 1926
    while receiving psychoanalytic therapy and encouragement from her friend and
    painter, Joseph Stella.  Wiegand was in Moscow as a journalist from 1929 to
    1932, where the Fauve paintings in the Morosof Collection inspired her
    imagination and desire to paint seriously.  When she returned to New York in
    1932, she became part of the cultural avant-garde and developed a close
    circle of friends such as John Graham, Carl Holty, Hans Richter, Joseph
    Stella and Mark Tobey, all artists who similarly shared a belief that art
    should be made from physical beauty and spirituality.  She became an
    associate member of the American Abstract Artists in 1941, a full member in
    1947, exhibited with them from 1948, and later even became its president
    from 1951 to 1953.

    degree in philosophy from UCLA and subsequently became an aviator in World
    War II. After the war he decided to stay to work as a painter in
    Montparnasse, Paris.  He later studied art at the Art Center School, Los
    Angeles and at Académie Julian, Paris from 1949 to 1951.<br><br>His early
    painting, like the current work, was inspired by the New York School of
    abstract expressionism, which included Franz Kline (1910-1962), Robert
    Motherwell (1915-1991), Jackson Pollock (1912-1956), Mark Rothko
    (1903-1970), Ad Reinhardt (1913-1967), Willem de Kooning (1904-1997) and
    Philip Guston (1913-1980), among others.  After a period of hard-edge
    painting based on geometric abstraction through the 1960s, Levee returned to
    his more spontaneous abstract expressionist style, often using collage
    elements with loose brush work typical of lyrical abstraction.

    early in his career in the 1950s and won first prize at the Corcoran
    Biennial in Washington, D.C., in 1955. Though initially he was associated
    with the Bay Area Figurative Movement, he also worked in the Abstract
    Expressionist style as well as Surrealism and Realism.  In 1971, he moved to
    Monhegan Island, Maine and much of his work from that period reflects his

  CROSSHEAD: Surrealist Portrait of Leo Manso.
  TYPESET: >-

    15¼x10¾ inches.  Signed in charcoal, lower right recto. <br><br>Provenance:
    Gifted by the artist to Leo Manso, New York; thence by descent to current
    owner, private collection, New York.  <br><br>Burliuk (1882-1967) and
    abstract artist Leo Manso (1914-1993) may have first crossed paths in New
    York in the late 1940s, where they moved in the same artist circles.  They
    both participated in a group show at the Downtown Community School's
    December 1947 fundraising exhibition, alongside Milton Avery, Dorr Bothwell,
    George Constant, Harry Gottlieb, Louise Nevelson, Marguerite and William
    Zorach, and Moses and Raphael Soyer, among others.  Burliuk had settled on
    Long Island and Manso in Provincetown, Massachusetts in 1947, though there
    were crosscurrents between the two communities as artists summered in both
    locations.  Late in Burliuk's career, from 1951 to 1965, he was represented
    by the Provincetown Tirca Karlis Gallery, the same firm that represented
    Manso through the 1960s.

    Levy, Julien Levy's widow, Connecticut; The Jean and Julien Levy Foundation
    for the Arts, Newtown, Connecticut; private collection,
    Chicago.<br><br>Kelly (1901-1982) was born in Philadelphia and studied at
    the School of Industrial Art (now the University of the Arts), Philadelphia,
    and with Arthur Beecher Carles (1882-1952) at the Pennsylvania Academy of
    Fine Arts, Philadelphia.  He was an avid student and also sought out
    instruction outside of formal art school.  He was granted permission to
    study anatomy at the Philadelphia School of Osteopathy where he dissected a
    cadaver and perfected his knowledge of the human figure.  He also met and
    studied etching with the Philadelphia printmaker Earl Horter (1881-1940). 
    During the mid-1920s, Kelly traveled to Paris and became acquaintances with
    Henry Miller, James Joyce and the critic Félix Fénéon as well as copying
    frequently at the Louvre.  He is most well-known for his contributions to
    American Surrealism, but his work also encompassed styles such as Cubism,
    Social Realism and Abstraction.  Reclusive by nature, a character trait that
    became more exaggerated in the 1940s and later, Kelly's work reflects his
    determination not to be limited by the trends of his time.<br><br>Kelly
    married Helen Horter, the ex-wife of his mentor Earl Horter, in 1941, his
    second marriage after a brief marriage with a French woman, Henriette
    D'Erfurth, during the 1930s had dissolved.   In 1940, Helen Horter had
    contacted Julien Levy, a Harvard classmate of her brother-in-law Paul
    Vanderbilt, to propose an exhibition of drawings by Kelly.  Levy's gallery,
    The Julien Levy Gallery on 57th Street in New York was at the forefront of
    innovation and Surrealism.  His stable included Salvador Dalí, Arshile
    Gorky, Yves Tanguy, Roberto Matta, Max Ernst, Joseph Cornell and Marcel
    Duchamp.  Levy was impressed by Kelly's work and began representing him. 
    His first show was an exhibition that traveled to the Art Alliance in
    Philadelphia in 1941.  A one-man show followed in March 1942 in New York. 
    In 1943, the magazine View printed nudes by Kelly and Pablo Picasso that
    resulted in the banning the issue in the United States.  In 1944, Kelly had
    a second one-man show at the Julien Levy Gallery.

    designed camouflage patterns, but during this time fell into a depression
    and used art as a creative outlet. After the war, he finished his Masters of
    Art degree at the University of Wisconsin, focusing on Max Ernst (1891-1976)
    and writing in defense of nonsense, wit and the irrational in art. His own

    fancifully with scale, creating fantastical, humorous compositions.

    attending the Canadian Royal Academy of Arts, Ontario and working as an
    artist in Montreal, Benjamin (1899-1985) moved to New York in 1923 and
    attended classes at the Art Students League, Cooper Union, and the
    Educational Alliance Art School while working as a commercial artist for the
    New York Sun newspaper, where he would work for the next 25 years.  Benjamin
    received instruction from Joseph Pennell, John Sloan and Yasuo Kuniyoshi and
    became close friends with Sally and Milton Avery.  As part of the artist
    circle surrounding Avery and the studios in the Lincoln Arcade, a building
    at 65th Street and Broadway later torn down to build Lincoln Center,
    Benjamin became acquainted with French modernists such as Marcel Duchamp and
    Francis Picabia as well as other New York artists including Stuart Davis and
    Mark Rothko. Benjamin's formal training and his close association with
    French and American modernists created a stylistically blended œuvre that
    incorporated minute details with dynamic, sweeping lines and colors, which
    became more abstract as his career progressed.<br><br>During the Great
    Depression, Benjamin moved from Lincoln Arcade to East 59th Street, though
    still kept close ties with the Avery family, accompanying them to
    Gloucester, Massachusetts during the summers.  Rather than appeasing critics
    who called for a thoroughly American art genre to be consumed by the masses,
    Benjamin held to his idea that art should convey personal emotions and
    feelings rather than conforming to a strict dogma as in Social Realism,
    though he painted much of the same subjects.

    von Wiegand Collages," Noah Goldowsky, Inc., New York, March 25- May 3,
    1975, number 23.<br><br>Von Wiegand (1896-1983) was a New York based
    abstract painter, writer, collector, benefactor and art critic.  She started
    to paint in 1926 while receiving psychoanalytic therapy and encouragement
    from her friend and painter, Joseph Stella.  Wiegand was in Moscow as a
    journalist from 1929 to 1932, where the Fauve paintings in the Morosof
    Collection inspired her imagination and desire to paint seriously.  When she
    returned to New York in 1932, she became part of the cultural avant-garde
    and developed a close circle of friends including John Graham, Carl Holty,
    Hans Richter, Joseph Stella and Mark Tobey, all artists who similarly shared
    a belief that art should be made from physical beauty and spirituality.  She
    became an associate member of the American Abstract Artists in 1941, a full
    member in 1947, exhibited with them from 1948, and later even became its
    president from 1951 to 1953.

    Galleries, New York; private collection, Massachusetts.<br><br>Bacon
    (1895-1987) was best known for her realistic representations of everyday
    life and her satirical caricatures.  She studied at the Art Students League,
    New York, with Kenneth Hayes Miller, John Sloan and George Bellows, and
    taught herself drypoint there in between drawing classes.  Looking back at
    her time at the League, Bacon said, "The years at the Art Students League
    were a very important chunk of life to me and very exhilarating.  It was the
    first time in my life, of course, that I had met and gotten to know
    familiarly a group of young people who were all headed the same way with the
    same interests.  In fact it was practically parochial."  From the 1910s to
    the  1930s, she worked mainly in drypoint printmaking and also doing
    illustrations for the satirical magazine Bad News, while her later drawings
    appeared as illustrations in publications including The New Yorker, New
    Republic, Fortune and Vanity Fair.  She further went on to illustrate over
    60 books, 19 of which she also wrote.<br><br>Bacon exhibited frequently in
    New York from the 1910s onward, with galleries including Alfred Stieglitz's
    Intimate Gallery, the Weyhe Gallery and the Downtown Gallery (she had more
    than 32 solo exhibitions during her career), and was closely connected with
    other artists with ties to these galleries, including Katherine Schmidt and
    Yasuo Kuniyoshi.

    Private collection, Chicago.<br><br>Dehner (1901-1994) initially came to New
    York by way of California, to pursue acting and dance, which she studied at
    the University of California, Los Angeles. She enrolled at the American
    Academy of Art in New York, but her travels in 1925 throughout Europe, where
    she was introduced to works by Picasso and Matisse, convinced her to change
    course and pursue a career as an artist.<br><br>She studied for several
    years at the Art Students League and there met the American modernist
    sculptor David Smith, whom she married in 1940. She exlpored more
    progressive art forms similar to Smith's interests, adhering to abstract and
    cubist tendencies rather than representational imagery.<br><br>The couple
    moved to Bolton Landing, in upstate New York, where, gradually Dehner's art
    became secondary to her duties as a wife (her painting series Life on the
    Farm and a group of black ink drawings she called the Damnation Series,
    mid-1940s, serves as a psychological reflection of the mundanity of her life

    1950 and divorced a year later. Subsequently, Dehner fully resumed her
    career as an artist, studying printmaking at Atelier 17 and returning to
    painting and sculpture with renewed creative energy.
