  FOOTNOTE: >-
    "Fort Crawford," 23 August 1832: ". . . Experience has proved that the
    oftener troops are moved even from one station to another the more efficient
    they are, as it has the effect in a great measure of preventing that
    accumulation of large quantities of baggage . . . when they are permitted to
    remain for several years at the same station, particularly if it is a
    frontier one. Frequent movements . . . along the upper Mississippi and the
    rivers emptying into it through the Indian Country, would not only have the
    effect of making them respect, but fear us & as a matter of course, would be
    the means of keeping them quiet. Such movements not only invigorate the
    officers & men, but at the same time would serve to instruct the former in
    the important duties of moving & encamping troops; in what ought to be
    considered an enemy's country. . . .<br>"I should not have hesitated on my
    arrival here from the campaign, in relieving one of the companies at Fort
    Snelling with one from this post . . . had not Gen'l Atkinson, who was
    present at the time, advised or directed me not to do so until I referred
    the matter to the Gen'l-in-Chief . . . . In the present state of affairs,
    should the Indians in the vicinity of Forts Snelling & Armstrong become at
    any time dissatisfied & threaten hostilities toward the whites, I would not
    feel myself authorized to reinforce either of those garrisons . . . without
    an order to that effect from higher authority, let the emergency be what it
    might. . . ."<br>"Fort Frank Brooke," 21 December 1838: ". . . I found at
    Fort Fanning two companies of the 2nd Inf'y which had reached that place a
    few days before from the North and having learned on my arrival that the
    Indians had stopped a train of four wagons belonging to citizens near
    Waccasassa and robbed the drivers (Negroes) of their clothing and wagon
    covers, . . . I determined to proceed to this place with the Infantry and
    Dragoons . . . and have the country between the Suwannee and Tallahassee
    completely scoured and the enemy driven from it before I left it . . . .
    Several reconnoitering parties had been sent out by Major Noel . . . one of
    whom fell in with and captured an Indian, who afterward however made his
    escape. Many recent signs of them were found indicating that they were in
    considerable force . . . . [I]t is hoped that the enemy will be driven from
    Middle Florida, and entire security given to the inhabitants in a very short
    time. . . .<br>". . . Col. Twiggs reports that some outbuildings within
    three miles of Black Creek were burnt by the hostiles (where there were from
    three to four hundred troops) who also fired on the house, in which was a
    woman and six or seven children . . . . The Indians, if Indians they were,
    ran off; he also states that a cart accompanied by two men was robbed by the
    hostiles . . . and a man was fired at and shot through the arm between Fort
    Heilman and Jacksonville--all of which from reports appears to have been
    committed by a few Indians and one Negro. . . . I am constantly informed of
    murders committed on our citizens, house burned and other depredations on
    their property, in situations where they are ten times more numerous than
    the enemy who they say committed them. I shall however do all in my power to
    give protection to the inhabitants even should I be compelled to abandon a
    part of my original plan of campaign."

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Scott's endorsement, 11 May 1843: "For the information of the Secretary of
    War, I beg leave to say--the post of Fort Washita was originally established
    at the instance of Mr. Secretary Bell, on considerations such as are set
    forth within, & also strongly urged by Brig. Gen'l Taylor in his letter of
    March 29, 1843 . . .--that on the 3d of Feb. 1843, Gen'l Taylor was
    instructed by the Secretary of War to suspend the further progress of the
    new work until further orders, & that on that direction, I inserted the
    provision in Gen'l Orders No. 21 (March 8, 1843) in which it is said the
    commander of the 2d Department (Gen'l Taylor) will take 'care to break up no
    established post, unless it be that on the Fake Washita, without leave'
    &c.<br>"Being now of the opinion that the post should be continued &
    completed, I propose, with the sanction of the Secretary, to give Gen'l
    Taylor instructions to that effect."<br><b>With</b>--William Armstrong.
    Letter Signed, "Wm Armstrong / Act[ing] Sup[erintenden]t W[estern]
    T[erritory]," to Zachary Taylor, reminding him that the government is
    obligated under a treaty to protect the Choctaws and Chickasaws and that
    abandoning Fort Washita would leave them defenseless. 1¼ pages, 4to, with
    integral blank. "Choctaw Agency," 8 April 1843.<br>The government's
    inability to protect the Choctaws and Chickasaws from the predations of the
    Plains tribes contributed to the ease with which they were recruited as
    allies by the Confederacy at the start of the Civil War.

    School children see THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. I really made the picture for
    young people. In their hands will lie decisions for good and evil of a
    magnitude that no other generation has ever been called upon to make. Only
    if these decisions are based upon the eternal principles of
    morality--written once upon tablets of stone, and embedded by our Founding
    Fathers into the American way of life--can freedom under God, as we know it
    in our land, survive in the world. . . ."

    "First thank you so much for sending me such a lovely date book with I do
    believe Sarah Bernhard[t] on the cover! (am I right). You are dear to spoil
    me and I love my gift.<br>"I am sorry I did not answer your long letter,
    about Gigi, to me before. The reason was that things were really popping at
    the time, and I wanted to write when I knew more. Well I am afraid it is not
    to be. No one could have put up a stiffer fight than Kurt and I did over
    this last year and over this last month. Paramount first never bought it
    because of the censor problem. Nevertheless I have continuously mentioned
    the property. Metro have now bought it since it is solved from the
    censorship point of view. They naturally bought it for Leslie (who would be
    perfect for it) and it being her studio she has the right to it. Metro were
    willing to have me do it but no deal was worked out between them and
    Paramount which I possibly could make, as you know. In these situations the
    actor is the one who gives everything in order to play a part he or she
    wants.<br>"I am sorry as I loved the play. I now console myself that maybe I
    have grown up too much and a younger person than I should play it. I
    certainly hope they will produce it with all the love and care it
    deserves.<br>"We had a divine Xmas, hope yours too was as happy, lots of

    actually done in America as well as in Europe along the lines mentioned
    above, as based upon too narrow an hypothesis. The neurotic problem cannot
    be solved through reduction to sexuality. It only suits a certain kind of
    mentality. It is a striking argument against the Sex-hypothesis, that
    Freud's first pupil, Adler had to invent an absolutely different theory,
    that suits many people much better than Freud's view, as the effect
    shows.<br>"I try to reconcile the contradictory views through a theory of
    attitude and a different appreciation of symbolism. The latter viewpoint has
    been taken up by Silberer too, as you know."

    "I think that the priest play is one of the most charming things I have read
    and, as you say, it would be a most welcome change for me (and I hope for
    audiences) to play someone 'good'.<br>"As it happens I know very well just
    such a man as Padre Pantaleone who lives in the hills south of Naples at
    Ravello. We gave him money to support his miraculous effigy of Santo Cosmo
    and were showered with oranges, figs, local liqueurs and garlic cake till
    the day we left.<br>"I think the construction of the play is perfection, but
    the translation is perhaps not all it might be. I have a hunch that the one
    person to translate the play, direct from what I surmise is the original
    Italian, is Osbert Sitwell. He . . . has an intimate knowledge of and love
    for these Italian vineyard people and his English is probably the prettiest
    written.<br>"It would need, also, the most delicate direction. I took the
    liberty of persuading Jimmy Whale to read it. He shares my opinions and
    seemed quite inclined to want to direct it himself. . . . I cannot think of
    another director with the requisite sympathy for the necessary romantic
    colour, and can he design scenery (Americanism)?<br>"I had already read the
    Dumas play. Ye-e-e-s but there is a better one written by Eleanor Farjeon .
    . . .<br>"Are you considering as a possibility a London autumn production of
    Don Bonaparte with possibly a New York follow up if successful? . . .<br>"I
    am not yet a Hollywood fan. No rehearsals, just banged in front of a camera,
    in a minute the scene is 'in the can', no redress. In the future I shall
    feel more sympathetic towards bad performances on the screen. Everybody is
    very nice but one feels that at any moment one might find oneself on the
    wrong side of the street door; however we are asked to Ben Schulberg's to

    translate the book chapter at a time and to place it in the American press.
    At the very last moment, I learned that nothing of the sort has happened. I
    can only regret this. Although my interests are thereby obviously encroached
    upon, to my regret, I cannot demand that Mr. Fischer sacrifice his interests
    for my sake. In any case, I have written to him about your proposition, and

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    ". . . Any claim that President Nixon was not involved in wrong-doing in the
    Watergate affair is shown to be false by the words imprinted by his own
    voice on his own secret tapes.<br>"Tapes made by him and Haldeman six days
    after the burglarers [sic] were caught in the Watergate reveal that on June
    23, 1972, he and Haldeman both knew that the break-in was an enterprise of
    the committee which he set up to promote his reelection; that the break-in
    had been financed by his campaign funds; that the FBI was about to discover
    the source of the particular funds which were used to finance the burglary;
    and that Nixon and Haldeman on that day conspired to induce the CIA to
    persuade the FBI to stop its investigation as to the source of the
    funds.<br>"The words on tapes . . . show that at all times President Nixon
    aided and abetted his aides in hiding the truth about Watergate from the
    American people, the courts, and congressional committees, and that at no
    time did he ever make any honest effort to have the truth about Watergate
    revealed. . . . [T]he ten Republican Congressmen who had voted [a]gainst his
    impeachment to the last stated that these tapes showed he was guilty of
    obstructing justice . . . [T]hey said it had been claimed in the past and
    would undoubtedly be claimed in the future that Nixon was driven from office
    by political enemies and a hostile press. They stated that this was not
    true, but on the contrary, Nixon's misfortune was self-inflicted . . . ."

    ". . . I was in China . . . and on returning spent all my time writing a
    book which is at last finished and at the printers. ('Chinese Encounters'.)
    I don't know if you are still working in Bed-Stuy with addicts, but if you
    are and if your question still holds I'll try to answer it.<br>"The question
    was, what gives a work 'lasting' importance; (plus another--'is being
    blessed with a writers creativity a blessing or a lonely life?')<br>"The
    question is hard to answer mainly because there are so many different kinds
    of writing that have lasted. Shakespeare lasts, probably, because of the
    beauty of his language more than anything else, but a writer translated from
    another language, like Tolstoy, is forever new because of his stories and
    characters. A book like Robinson Crusoe, on the other hand, probably lasts
    so long because of the idea behind the story, one which reflects something
    we have all imagined at one time or another--being cut off from the whole
    world. A writer like Mark Twain probably lasts because of both his humor and
    the nostalgia his tales evoke in us for a simpler America.<br>"So I don't
    know of any single reason that would explain them all. . . .<br>". . .
    [W]riting lasts when it conveys a clear and vivid impression of itself,
    while at the same time it is complex enough to bear re-reading and study.
    The clarity of the expression seems most important. In short, whatever it
    is, it is just that most sharply and clearly so that it imbeds itself in the
    readers' minds.<br>"As for the writer's life--the best of it is that you are
    independent of others, but it is a very lonely life and you have to be built
    for it to endure. It's a life where nothing ever happens--nothing that
    really matters--except inside you, a life where very few times are you
    satisfied. But I wouldn't trade it for any other."

    17 October 1948: "I can easily see why you killed the swans and let me say
    that when they get you for it, no one will come more quickly to your defence
    than I. In fact, I am now thinking about having Hazel Wickers kill some
    swans. I believe there should be a good killing in every high calibre
    literary novel and ever since his business with the owl, he has been shaky
    on birds. I had a party in the book but I took it out because I thought
    Edith Wharton and John O’Hara might want things to themselves, but I see no
    reason why I shouldn’t have some swans. When I get to be an Assistant
    Professor, I will give a course in the Swan Novel, which will include all
    novels with swans in them; if the class is small, I can . . . include novels
    with ducks, geese, or gulls. But if you are writing your novel and want to
    be taught in this class, you had better put a swan in it, because I expect
    the class will be large.<br>". . . When [Iowa] Governor Blue asked you where
    the ladies’ room was, you told him and thereby committed yourself to a
    certain interest in Iowa politics. Also, knowing Paul Engle you are well
    acquainted with the Iowa Farmer. You could make up what you lack in love,
    with earnestness.<br>"I had decided myself that the Iowa Farmer was out of
    his head by a postcard he sent me. He is recommending me for a Guggenheim,
    which gesture I appreciate. The postcard . . . also said, in soggy
    pentameter, how for three years I had lived on Iowa corn and look how I had
    grown. If I didn’t appreciate his occasional spurts of energy in my behalf,
    I could hit him with several ugly images. I don’t think I will ever be back
    at Iowa.<br>". . . My Parent as you may imagine took a grim view of my
    return to Yaddo. Old ladies who have watered in Saratoga have brought back
    pieces of information which she has collected and pieced together into a
    picture representing the evils which surround me. The picture was very pale
    and I kindly colored it for her, which was a grave mistake. . . .<br>". . .
    Yaddo is much pleasanter in the fall than summer. Pretty soon there will
    only be three of us here besides Elizabeth. Keep me informed about the stuff
    there on which I grew for three years. I think I am going to dedicate my
    book to Purina Scratch Feed.”<br>25 January 1949: "This is to wish you and
    Anne some graciousness for the season. I suppose I mean the Lenten season. I
    didn’t go home for Christmas. I stayed here. This was my first Christmas
    away from the birds and the kin and the flowers and I liked it fine. . .
    .<br>"I had a letter from Engle before Christmas suggesting I send him my
    novel if Rinehart didn’t want it and let him send it to Random House with a
    bunch of others for some vague deal or other he is trying to cook up with
    them (tone my own). Do you know anything about this, such as, is there any
    money in it? I can’t complain about his behaviour anymore as he wrote me a
    nice exaggerated letter for Mr. Moe of the Guggenheim Thing. I understand it
    takes ten years to get a Guggenheim so I am starting while a child. . . .
    Anyway, I have declined to be more trusting in the Lord and not apply for
    any teaching job next year. I hanker in my prayers for Grace and either an
    advance from the Brothers Rinehart or an extension from the Executive
    Director of this place; but I may just get the Grace. . . ."

    reporting that he has received and returned the [corrected] manuscript of

    story was accepted, showing admiration for the magazine, hoping that it
    would accept his story, "The Aesthetics of Ugliness" ["Die Ästhetik des
    Hässlichen," 1874], granting permission to make editorial changes, and, in a
    postscript: "The exorcism in 'Die Ästhetik des Hässlichen' is based on
    actual events. The man--Father Gaßner--is today a professor of theology in
    Salzburg and the author of a book on exorcism, the publication of which has
    had . . . only a comic effect." 3½ pages, 8vo, written on a folded sheet;
    faint scattered foxing, folds, docketing on terminal page in unknown hand.
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    "By receiving the proofs of my short story, 'Die Hochzeit im Eispalast,'
    which I return to you under cover, I see that you have also accepted the
    story, which makes me particularly happy, because there is no magazine in
    Germany that I appreciate as much as the 'Monatshefte.' My admiration is
    also explained by your having helped begin my career as a Latin writer with
    my 'Don Juan von Colomair.'<br>"I should be very lucky if my longer work,
    'Die Ästhetik des Hässlichen,' which I sent you some time ago, should be
    appreciated by you and, consequently, would be published in the
    'Monatshefte.' If you should be shocked here and there by details in the
    manuscripts that I send you, I give you once and for all and without
    reservation the right to make changes, because with a censor like you,
    knowing your good taste, I have everything to gain."<br>Sacher-Masoch's
    story, Die Hochzeit im Eispalast: Eine russische Hofgeschichte, was
    published in the April 1873 issue of Westermann's Illustrierte Deutsche

    21 February 1952, to Maurice, in English: ". . . I hope we'll see you in New
    York in a week, as you had said. . . . I started again to paint quietly,
    every day, the whole time. The exhibition, I think, is not without any
    success, some people are strongly interested. The[re] were articles in
    several newspapers, the most violently against. It does not matter at all.
    One must expect, when he proposes a change in any field, there will not go
    without outcries and fury. . . ."<br>18 October [1954], to "My very dear
    Maury," in English: ". . . Did you hear that Mr. Zadok bought also several
    pictures of mine . . . ?<br>"There will be a big show of my pictures, done
    from 1942 to 1954, in Paris, at the Cercle Volney, from March 15th to April
    15th.<br>"These days I am busy with lithographs, and small pictures with
    gouache. . . ."<br>26 October 1955, to the Culbergs' daughter Franka,
    writing from Vence: ". . . I do not feel perfectly at ease . . ., but a
    little like an exile in a foreign land. . . . However, I have good working
    conditions here: very good light, several workshops (I'm getting ready to
    build new ones). I'm working a lot, endlessly. . . . The very strong
    friendship that tied me to [her father, Maurice] leads me to feel tied to
    you by family and I feel a bit like your brother, or your uncle. What a
    precious good it would be for me if he were now alive! But, well, he is
    dead. He remains a brilliant star in the sky of my life. . . ."<br>18
    December 1966, to "good little Frankie": "I've been extremely busy for two
    months with my paintings; and the work site for my Chinese ink 'collections'
    (in the little studio that is reserved for them and which your mother knows)
    is a bit abandoned. . . ."<br>7 January 1956, to Mrs. Ruth Culberg: ". . .
    My painting still occupies me a great deal constantly. The new buildings I
    had constructed in Vence, and which comprise several very bright large
    studios, now provide me with places there [that are] well adapted to my
    needs and where I am very happy. . . ."<br>11 October 1957, to "Dear friend
    Ruth," in English: ". . . In July we drived [sic] to Switzerland and Germany
    . . . but it was very bad for Lili, she was very tired and nervous; I see
    she cannot make such trips, it is too tiring for her . . . . I was very
    pleased with the exhibition of Leverkusen, I met there several people very
    enthusiastic, and important and interessant [sic] articles in newspapers. .
    . ."<br>1 August 1958, to "My dear little Franka": ". . . I am very busy [in
    Vence], because I work a lot. I suffer a bit from the heat that is raging
    these weeks and does no good for my business . . . ."<br>29 March 1959, to
    "Dear friend Franka": ". . . An exposition of my paintings should open in
    Paris, at the Daniel Cordier Gallery, April 28th. This exposition is titled,
    'Celebration of the soil.' It will include some very difficult canvases with
    a particular spirit, some called, 'Topographies,' others, 'Texturologies.'
    They are very austere paintings in which no people at all appear.<br>"Daniel
    Cordier is now (since two years) my art dealer in Paris. He is a very
    educated and cultivated man, very intelligent and knowing painting extremely
    well. . . . He's in New York right now. . . . He hopes that he will find
    there some possibilities for purchasing my paintings. . . . He asked me to
    give him a few addresses of people who own my paintings and who would be
    likely, either to sell some to him, or to give him information to help him
    find others that he might eventually buy. This is why I've given him your
    address. . . .<br>"These last months I've been very busy making a very large
    series of lithographs (several hundred); that has led me to establish
    veritable print shops in Paris and Vence; I employ two workers. Because of
    this, I haven't made many paintings, but I have nevertheless made a
    few."<br>31 January 1979, to "Dear Franka," in English: ". . . I keep a very
    nice remember [sic] of our meeting . . . And I also very often think of your
    dear father. I keep a great affection for his memory. His meeting is amongst
    the most important events of my life. . . ."<br>2 December 1982, to "Dear
    Franka": ". . . Regarding the eventual monument in Chicago . . . . Pace
    Gallery (with which I have an exclusive agreement for the U.S.A.) has right
    now in New York some large painted sculptures (3 and 4 meters high). It is
    possible to build, on order, more important monuments. But I'm afraid that
    it would be inopportune to suggest, at least for the time being, a second
    monument in Chicago. . . ."<br><b>With</b>--Small group of ephemera and

    assistant with Universal Pictures, who worked with both writers on the film
    adaptation. On the front free endpaper it reads "To Margaret: / With my love
    and / best wishes, / Harper Lee"; the rear endpaper: "For Margaret / with
    gratitude & / thanks for her / patience - / Horton Foote." Lee and Foote
    famously worked closely together on the film's script and enjoyed a long
    friendship aside from this famous and enormously successfull collaboration.
    The film was released in 1962 and this later impression closely corresponds
    with the timing of the film. It won three Academy Awards, including Foote
    garnering the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. Certainly among the finest
    association copies of this iconic title.

    from the elongated stems of lilies and gladiolas to an impressionistic
    rendering of a decaying hyacinth. The images are drawn on variously sized
    plates, enforcing the flowers’ arrangement and physical scale. Accompanied
    by a poem written by the American poet Henri Cole [...] The techniques used
    for the prints include line etch, drypoint, aquatint, and burnishing. Each
    print is a four-plate color etching comprised of a red, blue, yellow and
    black plate."
