    marching past his window. "The window -- a poster within the poster --
    separates the bright male world of waving flags and marching columns from
    the darkened interior feminine space . . . [exploiting] men's anxiety over

    Published by the U.S. Food Administration, this poster reminds immigrants of
    the beauty, promise and joy of arriving in New York harbor (optimistically
    rendered here with a red, white and blue rainbow and golden buildings) in an
    appeal for them to help their adopted country save food to feed the Allies.
    "The central figure, with one hand firmly placed on a food basket, motions
    with his other hand toward a ship being loaded -- a gesture that impresses
    the viewer with the urgency of providing food for Europe." (Magnes p. 48) To
    reach as broad an immigrant base as possible, this poster appeared in
    several different languages including English, Yiddish, Italian and
    Hungarian. This is the English version. Magnes p. 49, Rawls p. 113,

  TYPESET: >-
    A pretty sailor, the wind blowing her uniform, is staring longingly at her
    desired destiny. The image is a classic, sophisticated appeal for all the
    maritime branches of the service in which the implicit sexual innuendo is
    palpable and persuasive. Christy successfully used fetching women in most of
    his war posters, declaring "that his uniformed models represented the
    all-American girl a soldier dreams of coming home to, wholesome, outdoorsy,
    alluring" (Meehan cat. 15). He must have hit a nerve, as these images
    succeeded in seducing many men into the service. Two separate versions of
    this poster exist (see next lot). Rawls p. 80, Theofiles p. 46, Weill 216,

    An early sexy, taunting, challenging and daring recruitment poster, done two
    years before the United States entered World War I. Christy played upon "the
    confusion of genders [that] provided posters with provocative images like
    this . . . whose purpose is the seduction of men into service" (Paret p.

    The roots of America's present day Air Force extend back to August 1, 1907,
    when the U. S. Army Signal Corps established a small aeronautical division.
    When World War I began, in 1914, the extent of the American Air Force was
    "12 officers, 54 enlisted men and six aircraft"
    (http://www.af.mil/history/overview.shtml). On May 24, 1918, President
    Wilson removed responsibility for American military aviation from the Signal
    Corps and placed it within two agencies under the supervision of the U.S.
    Army: the Bureau of Aircraft Production and the Division of Military
    Aeronautics. These two branches were officially recognized as the U.S. Army
    Air Service.  Rawls 174, Theofiles 28.

    The United States Navy ordered its first airplanes on May 8th, 1911, a day
    that is considered to be the beginning of U.S. Naval Aviation. Most of their
    earliest planes were Curtiss Flying Boats, and the aircraft depicted here
    appears to be a Curtiss HS-2L, a single engine version of the larger,
    twin-engine H-16. This rare depiction of early U.S. military aviation is
    infused with the kind of glamor and romance that bespeaks a world at peace,
    leading us to date the poster from the years after World War I. Its scarcity
    can be explained by the fact that it was printed in California, and likely
    was not distributed nationally. Rawls p. 256.

  CROSSHEAD: WAKE UP AMERICA DAY. 1917.
  at-a-glance: '40½x28¼ inches, 103x71¾ cm.'
  TYPESET: >-
    On April 6, 1917, the United States Congress declared war on Germany. Over
    the next two weeks, the Recruiting Committee of the Mayor's Committee on
    National Defense organized one of New York's largest public recruiting
    campaigns in history. The day chosen to "Wake Up America" was April 19, the
    anniversary of the Revolutionary War battles of Lexington and Concord. The
    event, to be held on the 142nd anniversary of Revere's ride, was a giant
    parade down 5th Avenue, which attracted over 60,000 spectators. Airplanes,
    "the Paul Reveres of the skies," dropped appeals for recruits all over the
    city. Flagg supervised the construction of ten floats for the parade,
    several of which he designed himself. Given the short time between the
    declaration of war and the massive event, Flagg had to design this poster
    very quickly, which likely explains why it is composed of fewer colors than
    his normal lithographic work. The image, evoking a female Paul Revere
    emerging from the darkness, was not just a graphic flight of fancy. The
    "Wake Up America Day" celebrations began at midnight with a reenactment of
    Paul Revere's ride made by a young woman; Jean Earle Mohle, dressed as a
    Continental soldier, rode south through the streets of Manhattan "summoning
    the men of America to respond to their country's call" (New York Times,
    April 19, 1917). This is an image which Flagg, in his "only attempt at
    modernity" (Meehan 20), captures magnificently. Flagg p. 69, Modern American
    25, Rawls 136, Borkan p. 178.

  TYPESET: >-
    The expression, "Tell that to the Marines," had originally been an insult,
    implying that the Marines would believe anything, but Flagg's poster turned
    that around and made it into a veritable battle cry. The image of a man
    reading a chilling headline and instantly preparing to face off against an
    opponent, is a visceral allegory of an angry America springing to action to
    preserve what is right in the world. Flagg p. 82, Rawls p. 166, Theofiles

    A rare World War I poster, this image was printed locally in San Francisco,
    so it would have had a much smaller distribution than images meant for
    national exposure. Using the visual psychology of James Montgomery Flagg's I
    Want You (1917), this image depicts General Pershing. It was likely
    published following the release of the United States War Film "Pershing's

  TYPESET: >-
    "Without question one of the most powerful posters of the entire war."
    (Theofiles p. 120). In dark shades of sepia a nightmare-scenario of New York
    City under attack by German forces, with the Statue of Liberty in ruins
    (think of the final scene in Planet of the Apes), the city in flames and a
    squadron of German bombers overhead. "The poster's unlikely depiction of an
    air and submarine attack on New York was designed to bring the war home to a
    public whose distance from the fighting seemed to necessitate this most
    forceful sales effort." (Paret p. 75).  Several variations of this poster
    exist, both in size and color. Rawls p. 227, Paret 103, IWM I p. 47,

    Martin studied at the Art Institute of Chicago. He is best remembered for
    the over 400 record jackets he designed for Folkways and other labels. His
    work is hung at the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum, and the
    Smithsonian. At the outbreak of World War II, the armed services continued
    its long-held practice of rigid discrimination against African-Americans.
    This practice included not only a stubborn reluctance to acknowledge the
    capabilities of the African-American soldier or sailor, but also a shameful
    denial of their courage and bravery. When Pearl Harbor was attacked on 7
    December, navy mess-man Doris "Dorie" Miller was serving on the USS West
    Virginia when it was struck. Before abandoning ship with the rest of the
    crew, he braved enemy fire to carry a wounded officer to safety, and though
    not trained for combat, he took up one of the ship's anti-aircraft guns,
    possibly downing at least one enemy plane. "It wasn't hard. I just pulled
    the trigger and she worked fine. I had watched the others with these guns. I
    guess I fired her for about fifteen minutes. I think I got one of those Jap
    planes. They were diving pretty close to us." He eventually received a Navy
    Cross but only after intense pressure from the black press back home. Miller
    was killed when his aircraft carrier was sunk in the Pacific in November of
    1943. Nelson, p. 80, War Posters 262, Pollack p. 118.

    Atherton was a graphic designer and a surrealist painter. He is best
    remembered for his poster promoting the 1939 New York World's Fair, and his
    award-winning Buy a Share in America poster from 1941. He went on to design
    many covers for The Saturday Evening Post, Fortune and Holiday. This image,
    with America's resources arrayed on a flag whose perspective leads the
    viewer's eye towards the rifle and military equipment in the foreground, is
    a gem of American mid-century design. For a government publication, which by
    definition would have been produced in very large numbers, this poster is
    uncommon.

    One of the few photomontage images in the "Think America" series. "A group
    of Rochester industrialists . . . were concerned about the mental sabotage
    of their workers by the infiltration of subversive propaganda from outside
    their plants . . . Out of this problem our company developed what is known
    as the 'Think American' program. It is now in use in over 5,000 of the
    largest industrial, business, financial, and educational organizations in
    nearly every state. 'Think American' consists of weekly illustrated
    messages, each of which points up vividly and intelligently a virtue or
    advantage of the American way of life. Plants display these posters near
    time clocks, in restrooms, and at other points of heaviest employee traffic.
    In these days when we are doing everything in our power to speed material
    preparedness and to prevent material sabotage, the need for mental
    preparedness and the prevention of mental sabotage cannot be overlooked.
    'Think American,' we feel, is helping to do both of these jobs. Its messages
    are now reaching 7 million people weekly throughout the nation" (The
    Rotarian, September 1941, p. 3-4).

    In 1939, while still in France, Carlu designed a poster promoting the
    "Anglo-French Day for the benefit of the combatants and their families,"
    featuring two soldiers in profile, a theme which he clearly replicated in
    this 1941 poster, but with far more effect and impact. "A visual analogy is
    found between a machine gun and a rivet-gun" (Word & Image p. 61), driving
    home the connection between homefront workers and front-line soldiers. This
    is the larger of two formats. Carlu 50, Design for Victory p. 29, Word &

    "Designed for display in munitions factories, this striking image
    demonstrated the importance of their task to munitions workers far removed
    from the front's deadly dangers" (Meehan Military Posters cat. 17). Done in
    typical Rockwell realism (he even borrowed a machine gun from the army to
    get the exact details), this exhausted, battle-scarred and solo machine
    gunner is sitting in his torn fatigues on a yellow slope, out of ammunition
    and palpably desperate. A far cry from Rockwell's pleasant front porch and
    ice cream parlor scenes, but equally as poignant. Posters for Victory p. 72,

    The horrifying scene of a hanging reflects in the monocle of this
    high-ranking member of Germany's military. "At the start of the United
    States' involvement in World War II, the Roosevelt administration felt the
    need to counter the powerful anti-war messages of such media figures as
    newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst and radio personality Father
    Coughlin. [This image] echoes Roosevelt's characterization of the Axis
    powers as gangsters, bandits and criminals," (American p. 105). This
    chilling image was the winner of the National War Poster Competition of 1942
    held under the auspices of the Museum of Modern Art. American Style 67,

    "American artists from 43 States have gone to war armed with paint brushes,
    canvas, paper and a terrific determination to arouse the nation to winning
    the fight. This they did through the medium of 2,224 war posters . . . Ever
    since war broke out, and especially since the President's speech on the
    state of the Union last January [1942] which inspired slogans for these
    posters, American artists have been battling within themselves for a way to
    fight the war. . . 26 art organizations rallied together under the banner
    "Artist's for Victory." [And] combined with the Council for Democracy, they
    planned this poster campaign" (Life Magazine, December 21, 1942, p. 54). An
    exhibition of these posters was held at the Museum of Modern Art in the
    final months of 1942, and this poster was one of nine winning entries that
    was chosen for "national distribution to factories and public buildings"

  TYPESET: >-
    One in a series of conservation posters produced Douglas Aircraft in the
    early 1940s. "A material conservation program was adopted at all plants to
    conserve, properly segregate and salvage materials. North America
    effectively reduced waste and spoilage, not only of materials, but also of
    machinery and equipment. Rejected parts and inactive materials were directed
    into other manufacturing channels, while materials which could be re-used in
    aircraft production were segregated and salvaged for use in the plants" (The
    Aircraft Yearbook 1943, p. 271.)  "Since its creation in July, 1940, the
    Material Conservation Program . . . has been able to reduce the scrap 10.6
    per cent in sheet dural and aluminum. This is an approximate saving of
    120,000 pounds of sheet material alone, enough to make 20 attack bombers. 
    It is estimated that in 1941 over half a million  pounds of material can be
    saved  by continuing the practices which have been set up around the plant"
    (Douglas Airview, November, 1940, p. 34). These posters, printed to hang in
    the factories and administrative and corporate offices were not printed in
    large numbers which accounts for their scarcity. We have located only three
    other examples of this rareposter, one in the Bancroft Library, one in the

    One of over 2200 submissions sent in by professional artists for The Museum

    boost morale for the war, letting artists choose between 8 themes:
    Production, War Bonds, The Nature Of The Enemy, Loose Talk, Slave World Or
    Free World, The People Are On The March, Deliver Us From Evil, and
    Sacrifice. Only 9 winners were chosen, and this example, not one of the
    winners, was never printed as a poster. They were judged anonymously, so
    each original work had the artist's signature covered with tape for the
    assessment. These original works were deaccessioned from the MoMA in the

  at-a-glance: '29½x19¾ inches, 75x50 cm.'
  TYPESET: >-
    With Britain formally declaring war on Germany on September 3, 1939, the
    newly re-formed British Ministry of Information immediately began working on
    a giant poster publicity campaign to prepare the British populace for what
    the ministry feared would be an "appalling series of shocks, resulting in
    shattered nerves, a lack of confidence in ultimate success, and therefore a
    lack of will to work for victory" (Three Posters). Instead of a photograph
    or an illustration, each poster bore a depiction of the crown of King George
    VI at the top as an indication that the messages came from the King himself.
    The third, and now most famous, of these slogans was kept back in
    anticipation of a truly horrific incident, such as the invasion of Britain
    by German forces or a severe air raid. Since the expected German attack
    never materialized, and because the first two posters had been met with such
    derision, "Keep Calm and Carry On," was never posted and was kept in storage
    for years. After the war, the remainders were scrapped for their pulp.
    Contemporary reports cite that almost two and half million copies of the
    poster were printed. An HMSO (His Majesty's Stationery Office) printing slip
    order form for the job breaks down that number, showing that the poster was
    printed in 12 different sizes, and that in this format, only 496,500 were

    One in a Rare series of venereal disease posters designed and issued by the

    V.D. Poster No. 14." <br>"One of the four original Numbered Air Forces,
    First Air Force was activated as the Northeast Air District on Dec. 18,
    1940, at Mitchel Field, Long Island, N.Y. It was redesignated First Air
    Force on April 9, 1941. In the first months of World War II, First Air Force
    was responsible for the air defense of the eastern seaboard of the United
    States. In January 1942, the command commenced shore-based anti-submarine
    operations flying Boeing B-17 "Flying Fortresses" from Langley Field, Va.
    Later that year, First Air Force turned to the task of training combat
    aircrews for immediate deployment to overseas theaters."

    In 1943, the Council of Industrial Organizations created the Political
    Action Committee in order to "protect the political rights of the working
    man, the returning service man, the farmer, and the small-business man"
    (Prescott p. 124). In 1944, the PAC worked towards registering union voters
    with an eye to the national elections of that year. In his posters, Shahn
    primarily appealed to farmers and factory workers, playing to their fears of
    hunger, unemployment, inflation and war. According to Shahn's wife Bernarda,
    the title of this poster was taken from a speech by Franklin D. Roosevelt,
    and here "this demonstration of union activity . . . is coupled with the
    exhortative message REGISTER - VOTE, which is repeated on all the CIO
    posters of this series" (Prescott p. 131). Prescott 155, Images of an Era 4,

    As part of their activism for peace (which included bed-ins) John Lennon and
    Yoko Ono launched a major media campaign in 1969, for which they purchased
    space on large billboards in 12 major cities around the world. The giant
    signs they pasted up read "War is Over / If You Want It / Happy Christmas
    from John and Yoko." Flyers with the bold, simple typographic message were
    distributed to passersby, and smaller posters were printed to be hung in
    windows of private homes. A savvy and prescient move (some cynics have said
    it was done for profit), the campaign received a tremendous amount of media
    coverage. Nevertheless, John and Yoko provided a generation of war-weary
    youth a new slogan to embrace. In 1971, they released a song "Happy Xmas
    (War is Over)," which has become a staple on holiday playlists. The other
    text variant reads "Happy Christmas from John & Yoko" at the bottom. The

  TYPESET: >-
    Lithuanian-born graphic designer George Maciunas was the founder of the
    Fluxus movement in 1961, a network of international inter-media artists who
    focused on the process of creating art, rather than the finished product.
    Influenced by avant-garde composer John Cage and Dada artists like Duchamp,
    Fluxus focused on "anti-art" and "anti-commercialism," with a spirit of
    humor and wit. Fluxus hosted public performances, festivals and street
    events in various cities, with contributing artists like Joseph Beuys, Nam
    June Paik, Ray Johnson and George Brecht. This reinvented image of the
    American Flag is attributed to Maciunas in collaboration with John Lennon
    and Yoko Ono. Maciunas did not sign works during his lifetime, in line with
    his manifesto on the dispensability of the artist's identity, but the poster
    is referenced in Fluxus publications. Another variant is printed only in red
    ink. Images of an Era 110, Graphic Design in America p. 58, MoMA

    designed only this one poster. It promotes an art show in Turin that has
    become historically significant. Not only was it the first international
    exhibition of modern decorative art, but it was the show that launched the
    Liberty style in Italy. It is also considered by some to signify the
    beginning of the end of the Art Nouveau era, as it introduced elements of
    contemporary design that would slowly evolve into the De Stijl, Art Deco and
    Bauhaus schools. Regardless of the historical interpretation, the show
    highlighted some of the greatest European designers. Bistolifi's image is a
    captivating symbolic representation of muses dancing in a field. Clad in the
    flowing robes of antiquity, the bolt of fabric they carry spells out "Ars". 
    This is the larger format and French version. Bolaffi p. 22, Manifesto 38,

    Hofbauer studied at the Prague School of Arts and Crafts and also at the
    Prague Academy where he was taught by Vojtech Hynais, one of the great Czech
    classical painters at the end of the 19th century. Primarily known as a
    painter, Hofbauer also designed several posters. Hana Kvapilova was the
    preeminent Czech actress of her era. Immensely popular, she was revered as
    both a national treasure and as a major force in the emancipation of women
    in Czech theatrical roles. Hofbauer's early posters combined "symbolist
    effect and Japonist techniques,"(Howard p. 93). Here, no longer adhering so
    strongly to symbolism, Hofbauer depicts the actress dramatically staring at
    the viewer through the clever concept of her reflection in a mirror. Rare.

    Throughout his career Metlicovitz produced over one hundred posters for
    commercial products, exhibitions, operas and the movie industry. His work
    can be separated into two distinct styles each one as superb as the other in
    terms of technical rendering; one is appealing and charming (this is the
    approach he used to advertise products), the other one, for official
    exhibitions is more academic and emphatic. Here, as if growing organically
    from the border of the image, a young beauty is entranced by the smell of
    the perfume she is holding. Like an allegorical blossom she is such a pure
    product of the natural world around her that even the butterflies believe
    the scent to be that of a flower, and flutter towards it. The natural color
    scheme, the garland of flowers in her lap and the surrounding flora and
    fauna all create a calm and voluptuous atmosphere. This is the second of two
    printings, the first, in 1898, was printed by Ricordi in Milan. Manifesti

    Mucha's second poster for Job, done two years after the first, is one of his
    best advertising pieces. Here, Mucha provides the viewer with three levels
    of reading that constantly reinforce the brand. The woman sitting in a
    circle, her dark hair contrasting with her skin and pink dress, is
    eye-catching in and of herself, as is the big, bold lettering across the
    top. As viewers look more closely at the image, they discover that Mucha has
    also included the company name in the wallpaper behind the figure, that she
    is holding a package of the product, and finally, that her brooch also bears
    the Job logo. The image and design create a masterpiece of commercial art.

    lived in Chicago in 1906. A prodigal cellist, she was slated to go on a

    World War I. While "the Art Nouveau ornamentation is virtually absent, other
    than a circle of stylized fleurs-de-lis in white behind Zdenka, and a
    similar white-outline garland around her cello," Mucha's style is present in
    the woman's hair and the collar of her dress (Rennert / Weill p. 346). This

    An influential artist and teacher, Dow's own work was heavily influenced by
    the "floating world", (ukiyo-e), of the Japanese woodblock masters and other
    Asian art influences, as well as the Arts and Crafts movement of William
    Morris in England. A teacher at many of America's most prominent Art
    Institutions (Pratt Institute, the Columbia University Teachers College, the
    Arts Students League, and his own Ipswich Summer School of Art) Dow's
    influence spread far and wide, including Georgia O'Keeffe, who was his most
    famous pupil. Perhaps his most lasting gift to the art world was his 1899
    manual Composition: A Series of Exercises in Art Structure for the Use of
    Students and Teachers, which became a standard art text at schools across
    the nation. Dow's most famous poster, reproduced in the Maitres de l'Affiche
    was for the magazine entitled Modern Art (Maitres pl 36). This scarceky seen
    image is for a magazine that was one of several titles that Arts and Crafts
    practitioners used to propagate their art (others included Keramic Studio,
    The Craftsman, The Hobbyhorse, Knight Errant and The Studio) and appears in
    at least two different colors advertising different months of the

    Most famous for his children's book illustrations, Parrish was nonetheless a
    "remarkable draughtsman, who energetically and successfully mixed fantasy
    and reality to create a luminous dreamworld that, for all its strangeness,
    is precisely rendered" (Parrish intro). He studied art at the Pennsylvania
    Academy of Fine Arts, and then at the Drexel Institute under Howard Pyle.
    "The great charm in Mr. Parrish's work lies in its curious individuality. It
    may well be said that he has felt the influence of many predecessors in
    design, but his work is stamped with his own originality. He is adroit
    enough effectively to conceal his borrowings if indeed he has borrowed at
    all. He realises for us a fairyland, undiscovered until he became its
    pioneer . . . every fact in the picture in itself appears to be tangible: it
    is the atmosphere with which Mr. Parrish invests all his facts which
    produces the sense of aloofness and elusiveness which one feels as one looks
    at his drawings. . . . [here] the figures of the three golfers are almost
    photographic in their realism. The undulating landscape, with its trees and
    cottage in the middle distance, is quite delightful" (The Poster and Art
    Collector, by Charles Hiatt, Vol. IV). Keay p. 22, Virginia p. 32, Art of
    Parrish 443.

    Oysters are shipped all over Europe in la caisse Simon, cartons which help

    captures that freshness and adds a veneer of class which can only have made
    the manufacturer happier with their choice of artist.  Two simple bands of
    color, one gray and the other light blue in the background create a wide
    open, outdoors effect in which a brightly-clad, elegant lady is indulging in
    an oyster, freshly shucked.  The sea air catches the dresses of the two

    Affectionately known as "The Green Devil," Cappiello struck a chord with

    Mingozzi spent his entire life and career in Bologna, where he founded the

    his largest clients were Barbisio hats, Ebano shoe polish and a variety of
    different brands of liquor, including Campari. This strong image from later
    in his career promotes the company's soda with its stylized, signature
    bottle. The image manages to both represent the bottle as an inverted
    cocktail glass and catch the viewer's eye with the vibrating background.

    Volodimer would not be remembered at all as a poster artist except for the
    images he designed in 1923, 1924 and 1925 for the first three 24-hour
    endurance car races that became known as the legendary "Le Mans." It was
    originally conceived as a three-year event, in which the winner, determined
    by whoever amassed the most miles over the three separate races, would be
    awarded the Rudge-Whitworth Cup. For this first-ever running of the
    prestigious race, the artist provides an exciting night time scene to
    emphasize the 24-hour element of the race. The poster also provides
    information about the other activities included to ensure that this became a
    popular and trendy event, such as fireworks, a jazz band and food organized
    by a Parisian brasserie. A rare document from the history of car racing.

    Garretto employs two established visual techniques to help convey his
    message. The advertised car has passed out of the frame, leaving only tire
    tracks and a plume of smoke behind. Yet, clearly it was such a car that it
    caught the eye and the attention of a trendy and handsomely dressed couple,
    who stand on the street corner looking after it. For the rest of us who were
    too slow to see it, there happens to be a poster within the poster depicting
    the car (ingeniously posted over other posters, whose corners are visible).
    Garretto was primarily a political cartoonist who became an international
    artistic star in the 1920s. He also received large commissions from American
    magazines like Vanity Fair, and began spending three or four months every
    year in the States.

  TYPESET: >-
    One of Porsche's strongest selling points was the company's impressive
    results in competitions. For over thirty years starting in 1951, posters for
    the Porsche competitions were designed by Eric Strenger. He revolutionized
    the design of racing posters by introducing modern typography and
    photography. Early in his career, he worked with photographs by other
    artists, but as his career matured, so did his style, and he began to work
    with his own photographs, which allowed him much more freedom of expression.
    As Reinhard Seiffert wrote, "he wanted to inform, not illustrate. Instead of
    adding something, he took things away. Instead of dramatizing, he
    abstracted. In this way the information moved into the foreground as a
    specific aim of the poster" (Porsche p. 15). Porsche p. 28.

  TYPESET: >-
    Built in 1902 for the British India Line as the Yamuna, the ship was bought
    by the Cunard Line and renamed RMS Slavonia in 1903. The liner was wrecked
    and sank off the Azores on June 10th, 1909, with no fatalities. It was the
    first ship to ever send an "S.O.S." distress message by Morse code. Two
    German ships, North German Lloyd's Prinzess Irene and Hamburg America's
    Batavia were able to safely rescue all 410 passengers. This exceptional
    nocturnal image stands out not only for the painterly way in which the
    subject is presented but also the unusual positioning of the ship. Ocean
    liner posters most often portray their vessels in 3/4 profile or profile.
    Here, the unknown artist presents the ship slightly askew from head on.

    Clifford and Rosemary Ellis married in 1931 and worked together for the rest
    of their careers. It is hard to describe their unique style, which has the
    colorful and fanciful qualities of children's illustration, yet is also
    compelling, eye-catching and charmingly composed. Their aesthetic certainly
    appealed to a large swath of the general public, as the duo was commissioned
    to design posters for the London Underground, Shell, the General Post Office
    (GPO) and the Empire Marketing Board. This poster was commissioned by the
    GPO Film Unit to advertise "Cable Ship," a 12 minute documentary on the
    repair of an International Telephone Exchange submarine cable that had been
    damaged. The 1933 film was grouped with 4 other short films, all centering
    on Post Office activities and repair work, and released in 1935 to
    considerable cinematic success. After the war, the artists primarily focused
    on book cover design.

    Bern Hill was a graphic designer and painter. He "worked for the Kudner

    Motor's Electro-Motive Division embarked on a rather radical advertising
    campaign which included vertical format streamline style paintings for the
    covers of Railway Age" (Vintage Rails, January / February 1998, p. 64).
    Between 1950 and 1956, Hill painted 65 paintings. "Electro-Motive also
    produced a series of very high-grade posters of Hill's paintings that were
    overwritten by the marketing theme for that particular railroad . . . it is
    unknown if all 65 paintings were turned into posters . . . Hill's assignment
    was to portray the 'feel' of each railroad in a scene that often captured

    "The beauty of Hill's locomotive paintings is found in the way he captures

    history that found America with an abundance of regional rail lines, all
    featuring distinctive paint schemes. Often railroads operated only in a

    Throughout his work for General Motors Hill "single-handedly managed to

    engineering and natural wonders along the various train routes. Here, an EMD
    F3 Locomotive, produced between 1945 and 1949 by General Motors, is shown
    here crossing the original Newark Bay Bridge connecting the Elizabeth port
    and Bayonne at the southern end of Newark Bay. The Central New Jersey
    Railroad bridge was superseded by the current Newark Bay Bridge which opened

    In 1895, the territory of South Zambezia (currently, Zimbabwe) was renamed
    Rhodesia after Cecil Rhodes, the British colonial whose South Africa Company
    governed the area from 1889. Depicted is the conical tower within the "Great
    Enclosure," a wall that runs around the ancient African ruins of "Great
    Zimbabwe," a city constructed from the 11th to 15th century. The site is
    noted not only for being the largest ancient structure south of the Sahara
    Desert, but also for the skill by which all of the granite rocks were placed
    together without the use of mortar. Robinson was a London-born cartoonist
    who moved to Rhodesia to become a farmer after the First World War. This

  TYPESET: >-
    In the years following World War II the possibility of comerical supersonic
    aviation began to take hold. In the early 1960s 18 different airline
    companies, including Continental, placed non-binding orders to add the
    airship to their existing fleets.  In 1963 Continental ordered three of the
    aircraft and this poster presents those aircraft, 7 years in the future,
    bearing the Continental "Golden Jet" livery, with gold tail and thin gold
    pinstrips along the fuselage.  This futuristic projection of their fleet is
    presented within the confines of an imaginary airport, equally as
    modernistic as the vessels themselves, reminiscent of Eero Saarinen's TWA
    Flight Center, which had opened at New York's JFK airport in 1962. 
    Ultimately, all the orders for Concrdes were ultimately canceled, except for
    Air France and British Airways, the only airlines to succesfully operate the
    Concorde commercially. Continental's poster represented an aviation dream
    that never came ot fruition for the company.

    Rand was first employed by IBM in 1956 to redesign the company's logo. He
    continued consulting for the company for more than 30 years, redesigning
    their logo at least twice more. In 1981, he came up with the now-famous
    rebus, which has become one of the most famous and recognizable corporate
    identity statements of the 20th century. It took a year for the company to
    actually use the design in promotion, at which point they printed it as a
    poster with small text at the bottom explaining the significance of each
    element of the rebus; the first printing was, as a result, a very small run,
    and very rare. This is the second printing. Modern Poster 211, Encyclopedie

  TYPESET: >-
    Die Stadt Ohne Juden [The City Without Jews] (1924), is an expressionist
    Austrian film by H.K. Breslauer, based on the novel of the same name by Hugo
    Bettauer. Although it was originally intended as a satirical novel (written
    by a progressive journalist and writer), responding to the brewing
    anti-Semitism of the 1920s, it eventually became a unsettling foreshadowing
    of what was yet to come in Europe. In the film, when the anti-Semitic
    Chancellor of the Christian Social Party comes to power, he passes a law
    forcing all Jews to leave the country. Following their departure, the
    country begins to experience cultural deficits, a suffering economy and
    unemployment. Eventually the Jews are brought back to Austria, and a
    parallel love story throughout the novel is also resolved. The film differs
    from the book in its "happier ending," with a plot twist that the whole
    story was actually a dream of an anti-Semite, meant to lessen the
    controversial impact of the movie. Also, the characters in the book could be
    identified as actual politicians, but this was altered in the film to avoid
    censorship. The film was shown in 1926 in Berlin, 1928 in NY, and in 1933,
    for the last time, in Amsterdam as a protest against Hitler. It then
    disappeared from the public eye until it was rediscovered in the early
    1990s, missing the final scene. The black and white sketch in this rare
    poster features a giant, ghastly figure forcing throngs of Jews onto the
    streets and out of the city. This featureless form, though created well
    before his rise to power, sports side-swept bangs eerily similar to
    Hitler's.

    A sallow-faced woman in a red dress sways to the music of a red-lipped jazz

    known about this play, the image does not appear to be a glorification of
    the drug, which was legal in Paris throughout the 1920s. The clear
    resemblance of the characters pictured to Edith Piaf, Harpo Marx and Al
    Jolson further suggest that this play, whether a morality tale or not, was
    celebrity-based.

    (1921-2005) who at the time was working as a jazz pianist before becoming a
    French recording industry magnate. We will probably never know anything

  DESCRIPT: DAVID HOCKNEY (1937- )
  CROSSHEAD: METROPOLITAN OPERA / PARADE. 1981.
  at-a-glance: '80x40½ inches, 203¼x103 cm. Petersburg Press, [London].'
  TYPESET: >-
    Hockney, who is admired and collected as a contemporary artist, made
    brilliant contributions to the world of opera, as a stage and costume
    designer. He also designed numerous posters. Beginning in 1975 with his work
    for Stravinksy's The Rake's Progress, until 1990 when he worked on Turandot,
    Hockney worked for the major opera houses. Among his most memorable
    productions were Mozart's Magic Flute and Wagner's Tristan and Isolde. His
    collaboration with the Metropolitan Opera on Eric Satie's Parade is
    best-represented by this poster. The image, with Hockney's neo-pop décor and
    costumes, showcases a juggler whose contortions fit eye-catchingly into the
    poster's elongated format. If the opera itself is not so popular, this image
    has become a classic. Hockney 94.
