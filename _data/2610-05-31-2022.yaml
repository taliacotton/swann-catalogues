  at-a-glance: 'Np, circa 1790'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    A curious and unusual eighteenth-century "chart" of the world centered on
    the mid-Atlantic. This appears to be an unfinished work in progress with the
    latitude and longitude lines drawn throughout, numerous cities and ports
    laid down, but with no landmasses delineated whatsoever: only the vaguest
    sense of the American coast, Europe, Africa and a small bit of Asia can be
    discerned from the placement of the toponyms. A triangulation at the east
    coast of North America bears the notation "page 29-38", suggesting the maker
    was consulting a navigator's guide, but no source text has been identified.
    The chart is almost certainly of American design, evidenced by the paper on
    which the map is drawn. Established circa 1788, the Stacy Potts & John
    Reynolds paper mill in Trenton, New Jersey was one of the earliest producers
    of hand-made paper in America.

    The plan demonstrates vessel routes in from the north and south, as well as
    soundings along the coast and around Robben Island. The elevations provide
    different vantages of the coastal topography witnessed from the sea - in
    addition to a tiny Cape Town, there are several notable labeled landmarks:
    Table Mountain, Lion's Head, Lion's Rump (Signal Hill), Robben Island, and
    Dutch East India Company fortifications and garrisons (Pentagone, i.e.,
    Castle of Good Hope; Batterie - Chavonnes Battery). Large merchant ships are
    seen anchored in the harbor, most bearing the Dutch flag and others a
    British Red Ensign.

    "The panoramic map in fact became a popular and effective technique for
    conveying information about the Civil War. Early in 1861, the skillful
    artist and lithographer John Bachmann of New York City conceived the idea of
    producing a series of bird's-eye views of the likely theaters of war. These
    visually attractive panoramas were easily understood and perhaps more
    meaningful to a public largely unskilled in map reading" - Stephenson, Civil

    Fine copy of one of the most comprehensive and impressively detailed

    to become immersed in the exacting detail of the illustrated towns and
    smaller villages, estates, homes and public buildings, personal gardens and
    agricultural fields, roads, dikes, dams, canals, polders, and other
    topographic features. The side panels are comprised of elaborate coats of
    arms for ten regional district officials; at the right is a spectacular
    compass rose featuring a world map and celestial elements; and the lower
    border is a decorative band representing domestic agriculture, hunting,
    fishing, beekeeping, etc., after designs by Arnold Houbraken.

    14th-19th century; each leaf as labeled by the compiler and not
    independently confirmed:


    - Leaf from a rare vellum Arabic manuscript of the 14th Century, expounding
    Muhammadan doctrine. 


    - Leaf from a manuscript Koran of the 17th Century. The calligraphy is
    regarded as unusually fine. 


    - Leaf from an old 3 volume Japanese work on Buddhism containing ceremonial
    and symbolic illustrations. Dated 1675. 


    - Leaf from a six volume Chinese medical work of the 17th Century. 


    - Leaf from the Saddharmapundarika, the text of Kumarajiva, in Chinese,
    copied by a Japanese priest named Joyen in 1834. 


    - Double leaf from a Chinese Buddhist work expounding the Sanskrit
    Scriptures. Probably 18th Century. 


    - Leaves from Robert Morrison's copy of "Descrition Geographique,
    Historique, Chronologique, Politique, et Physique de l'Empire de la Chine et
    de la Taratrie Chinoise", by the famous Jesuit missionary, Du Halde.
    Published at the Hague, 1736.


    - A printed page from a Japanese book, undated, but probably 18th Century. A
    popular edition of the Genji Monogatari, Japan's first novel, whose author,
    Muraski no Shikibu, is compared to the English Novelist, Richardson. 


    - Leaf from a Javanese rubricated manuscript of the early 19th Century
    giving the history of Rama (differing from the usual version). Although
    Muhammadanism is now the nominal religion of Java the myths and traditions
    of Hinduism have by no means been discarded. On the contrary Indian gods and
    heroes form the dominant theme in Javanese literature, drama and fold tales
    to the present day. 


    - Leaf from a manuscript book of miscellaneous information compiled by a
    devout Japanese Buddhist. Seventeenth Century. Note that the thrifty scribe
    has written on the reverse side of paper already used. 


    - Leaf of a Taliput manuscript in Tamil, from a Buddhist temple in Ceylon.
    Probably 18th Century. In India, Ceylon and Burma the leaves of the Taliput
    palm are used like Papyrus in Egypt. If the characters become indistinct rub
    lamp black into them with the finger, afterwards wiping off the surface of
    the leaf with a damp cloth. 


    - Leaf from Indian religious manuscript containing extracts from the
    Puranas, in Sanskrit. 18th Century. 


    - Leaf from a fine Sanskrit MS copy of the Puranas. Eighteenth Century. Note
    the precise characters and the regularity of the page. 


    - A leaf from a Turkish work, (Hadji Khalifa), printed in Constantinople in
    1733. Note that the borders are done by hand. 


    - Buddhist prayer sheet in Manchu characters brought to this country by a
    traveller from Mongolia. 


    - Double leaf from an old book (probably 18th Century) in Chinese
    characters, printed in Korea. Contains Buddhist Scriptures as interpreted by
    the Syen sect.

  CROSSHEAD: >-
    A family scrapbook of original drawings, watercolors, lithographs, and Peale
    Museum silhouettes
  TYPESET: >-
    pasted in an 1802 volume of the Philadelphia newspaper Gazette of the United
    States. Folio, 20 x 12½ inches, contemporary half calf, worn with boards
    detached; first 24 leaves used as a circa 1820s scrapbook, followed by
    approximately 100 complete issues of the Gazette of the United States, plus
    some partial issues, with moderate wear.
  at-a-glance: 'Philadelphia and environs, 1802-circa 1824'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This scrapbook was possibly kept by a descendant of Lynford Lardner
    (1715-1774), a close associate of the Penn's who had an estate at Tacony
    near Philadelphia. As nearly as we can tell, the artists featured include
    his daughter Hannah Lardner (1756-1839), and granddaughter Elizabeth Lardner
    (1791-1877), whose mother was from the Saltar family. Original art includes:
    a watercolor of a rose by Elizabeth Saltar Lardner of Tacony; an ink and
    wash landscape by Miss Hannah Lardner of Tacony; two ink and wash views by
    Frances "Fanny" Saltar (1790-1880?) titled "Cootstown from the East" (of
    Kutztown, PA) and "A View Down the Lehigh River from Bethlehem Bridge"; two
    watercolors of flowers by Frances Saltar of Tacony, trimmed and laid in
    rather than mounted; an unsigned watercolor still life of shells; an
    unsigned pencil sketch of a ruined building; an unsigned pencil sketch of a
    residence; and a watercolor of flowers in an urn signed "S. Courlander." 


    Also included are 20 silhouettes in a uniform format, 5 x 4 inches, all but
    three of them laid down on dark paper. Some bear faint embossed stamps
    reading "Museum," which helps identify them as products of Peale's Museum,
    run by the noted artist Charles Willson Peale. A formerly enslaved man named
    Moses Williams, who had been owned by the Peale family, secured his freedom
    in 1802 and then produced thousands of silhouettes for Peale's Museum at 8
    cents each. His remarkable story has only recently received attention. These
    works are not signed, and Peale may have employed other silhouettists in
    addition to Williams, but many, or all, of these portraits were likely by
    Williams. Three are captioned in manuscript: Mary F. Smith, "Lardner," and
    "Country Cousin." 


    Additional ephemera mounted in the scrapbook includes an 1824 engraved
    invitation to the Lafayette Ball; a set of French allegorical prints of the
    four seasons; 8 large hand-colored botanical engravings; and an engraved
    portrait of Lafayette by Longacre. 


    Most of the volume was never used as a scrapbook. The Philadelphia
    newspaper, Gazette of the United States, 16 February to 30 June 1802, is
    bound as fairly close to a complete run of approximately 100 issues, but 5
    issues are missing, and 7 are incomplete. The 8 March issue has two
    black-bordered pages to mourn the death of Federalism at the hands of Thomas
    Jefferson. More traditionally, the black-bordered 26 May issue mourns the
    death of Martha Washington.

    "Min River / Foochow / Pirate's Village Ahn Ing Kay / near here there are
    said to be 300 houses addicted to robbing boats. CF. Gordon Cumming, March
    12th 1879". 


    The present drawing was not reproduced as such in Cumming's 1886 "Wanderings
    in China" however pages 153-157 in volume one of that work are devoted to
    her March 12, 1879 journal recording in which she describes her experiences
    of the day relating to this particular spot on the river:


    "...I was anxious to see something of Ahn-Ing-Kay, an exceedingly
    picturesque village which had attracted our notice on the way up by its many
    gabled houses, bearing so strange a resemblance to old houses in Chester.
    There are the same crossbeams of blackwood, filled in with white stone or
    plaster, but the grey tiled roofs assumed curves undreamt of by English
    builders, whether ancient or modern. These houses, which are two and three
    storeys high, stand high along the river's broken bank, which here, as at
    many other villages, is crowned with noble old banyan trees, with great
    twisted stems and far-spreading roots.


    ...Supposing we were to spend the night here, we only returned to the boat
    at dusk, but found the boatmen in a fever of impatience, begging us to let
    them start at once, as this village bears such an evil reputation that no
    boat dares stay there after dusk! They affirm that the inmates of three
    hundred houses in this and the neighbouring villages are known to be simply
    pirates; in short, they insisted on starting instantly, which we accordingly
    did. The men rowed and poled for a couple of hours in the starlight, and
    then anchored in a quiet backwater at Min-Ching, where many other boats had
    already congregated for the night, and where we know we may now sleep
    securely".

    Turn of the nineteenth-century lower Manhattan observed across the East
    River from a small wooden dock on Brooklyn Heights - here in its first
    state, an utmost rarity, with the White Horse. 


    The plate was revised several months after this issue was printed with
    little, if any, modification to the cityscape; several trees are added to
    the foreground composition and the dock becomes obscured by two bank-side
    bushes. But most notably the brilliant white horse quietly grazing under the
    ancient tree is re-engraved in favor of the more commonly seen picnic party.
    A third state of the plate was issued circa 1820, unchanged, but with the
    imprint of Henry H. Morgan at the lower center. 


    Apart from his own example (at the New York Public Library), I.N. Phelps
    Stokes cited "Two other copies, only, of this print are known, one belonging
