    Dubouchet represented the district of Provins, Seine-et-Marne, a suburb of
    Paris. "Dubouchet implemented Revolutionary measures such as
    dechristianization and the tax on the rich, and he conducted purges to put
    sans-culottes in charge. Although hundreds were placed under suspicion
    during his three-month-long mission and dozens jailed, some for long
    periods, those suspected of serious crimes were sent to Paris to be judged.
    Nobody was killed in the Seine-et-Marne, though some citizens of the
    department were executed by Paris's Revolutionary Tribunal." (cf. Jeff

    Revolution</i>, Oxford University Press, 2020, page 63 ff.)<br><br>This

    under the <i>Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae</i> title vary widely in terms
    of production date, subject matter, content, and publisher. This collection
    begins with three folding maps/views of Rome. Ancient Roman temples are
    well-represented, as well as the Pantheon, and plates of other ruins and
    architectural details, the Arches of Titus, Septimius Severus, Constantine,
    and others. Several amphitheaters are depicted in single- and double-paged
    plates including the Coliseum. A double-paged plate by Claudius Duchetti
    dated 1582 and titled <i>Thermae Deocletianae et Maximianae</i>, a bird's
    eye view of the Baths of Diocletian, is present, along with a similar view
    by the same publisher dated 1581 and titled <i>Ornithon sive Aviarium M.
    Varronis</i>, and many others.<br><br>"Among the most important episodes in
    [the] story [of Renaissance print collecting] is the evolution of Antonio
    Lafreri's <i>Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae</i>, or 'Mirror of Roman
    Magnificence.' In the most general terms, the <i>Speculum</i> was conceived
    as an album of prints acquired from Lafreri's Roman publishing house and
    then composed according to the theme of ancient and modern monuments in the
    city. However, the project is difficult to characterize because every
    surviving example is to some degree unique in its content and organization.
    [...] Because Lafreri's stocks could be purchased either singly or in lots
    and then assembled according to the individual preferences of the collector,
    the title-page is often taken to signal the consummation of a marketing
    strategy, in effect the encouragement of a 'do it yourself' picture atlas
    with a predetermined theme." (cf. Parshall, Peter. “Antonio Lafreri's
    <i>Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae</i>.” Print Quarterly, vol. 23, no. 1,

    and contained notice of newly published books. "The pages of this periodical
    were teeming with the ideas of the greatest minds of those days – John
    Locke, Robert Boyle, Christiaan Huygens, Fénelon, Balthasar Bekker, Antoni
    van Leeuwenhoek, Richard Simon – and their innovative way of thinking. The
    intention was not only to promote these ideas among an intellectual elite,
    but also to disseminate them among a much wider circle of interested people
    that had hitherto been denied access to the cultural and spiritual life in
    Europe. The periodical in question was designed as a non-specialist medium
    but was nevertheless of sufficient scientific caliber to be properly
    considered as a variant of the then already existing scientific press." (cf.

    one, dedicated to deities and the stories of their extraordinary adventures,
    contains a fascinating and rich trove of imagery that characterize the

    to the people of the region, contains wonderful details of the period.
    Women's jewelry is depicted, along with a scene where a woman is receiving a
    henna tattoo, and another where a merchant in the marketplace is fitting a
    woman with bracelets. Other industries depicted include stone masonry and
    carving, the fabrication of metal bowls, bricks, the spinning of fiber,
    weaving, dying, and block printing of fabric, and many others. In the
    section of botanical images, plants are shown with fruit and flower,
    including cross sections of the fruit. Here are depicted bananas,
    pomegranates, lotus, papaya, ginger, bitter melon, durian, dates, citrus,
    and many others. The traditional wedding ceremony is depicted in multiple
    images, along with the ritual of the funeral pyre, an exorcism, food
    preparation, offerings to the gods, and the performances of wrestlers,
    dancers, musicians, the work of scribes, tailors, and much more.

A description of the equipment she used for carrying out the fermentation process appeared in the London journal <i>Philosophical Magazine</i> in 1823, a notably early date for a report of technical developments by a woman experimenter. Her method of using semi-closed vessels rather than the open vats then in general use gave a higher quality product for wines, cider, and beer; two years previously a short monograph on wine production and the advantages of the semi-closed-vessel method, which had already been granted a government patent, had been published by [her brother] Jean Antoine Gervais.\" (cf.

    addition to references to church fathers and the ancients, we also find
    mentions of Gassendi and Musschenbroek and many references to Newton,
    regarding color theory, the movement of various bodies, and gravity. Notes
    regarding electricity are also here, discussion of the nature of smells,
    sounds, and colors. The diagrams begin with simple geometry and progress to
    employment of such calculations in practical settings. The penultimate

The [work] was written for a competition organized by the Dutch Society of Sciences on a subject [Charles] Bonnet himself proposed. Senebier, who translated Spallanzani and carried out research into vegetable physiology, said his idea of reflecting on the art of observing was inspired by 'reading Bonnet again and again,' notably his <i>Analytical Essay on the Faculties of the Soul</i> and <i>Considerations on Organized Bodies.</i> Senebier took Bonnet's approach as a model of the analytic method and proceeded through a sort of <i>mise en abîme</i> in which he 'analyzed the important links in the chain' of analysis itself.\" (cf.

    advocates for following nature rather than interfering, with advice to let a
    fever take its course, for example. He explains how to prepare narcotics,
    writes against vivisection, and weighs the pros and cons of animal and human
    experimentation. Celsus is also credited with identifying the cardinal signs
    of inflammation: calor, dolor, tumor, and rubor.

    in.<br><br>Weyer, a Dutch demonologist, physician, and follower of Agrippa,
    was one of the earliest respected scholars to publicly decry the persecution
    of people accused of practicing witchcraft. He criticized the <i>Malleus
    Maleficarum</i>, preferring to describe people categorized as witches as
    melancholic or mentally ill. By his reasoning, practicing witchcraft is
    literally impossible. Norman describes his work, <i>De Praestigiis Daemonum
    et Incantationibus ac Venificiis,</i> as "the first major European work to
    take an empirical, scientific approach to the study of mental
    illness."<br><br>Heirs of Hippocrates 302; Norman 2224.
