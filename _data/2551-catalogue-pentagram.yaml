    FOOTNOTE: 'At the start of the Revolution, the military might of the British Navy was unmatched, numbering at over 200 vessels, while the Continental Navy began with fewer than 30. To win victory at sea, the fledgling government commissioned over 1,500 privateer vessels over the course of the War. A "letter of marque" issued by the Continental Congress, such as the one in this lot, offered a private ship owner the opportunity to simultaneously fulfill her duty to the new nation and exercise her enterprising spirit (since her crew often divided the spoils of seized enemy vessels). The life of a privateer, however, was dangerous: thousands were captured and neglected in prison ships anchored near the shores of New York City. Over 10,000 privateers and other American patriots who died of starvation or disease aboard these ships were hastily buried on the shore of the present day Brooklyn Navy Yard. Today, these remains are located in a vault below the Prison Ship Martyrs Monument in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn.'

[T]he appointment of his son would, I am confident, be quite satisfactory to him & at the same time w''d highly gratify his . . . friends in N.Y." John Van Benthuysen Bleecker (1825-1864) was commissioned Purser in the Navy on January 16, 1847; he served as paymaster of the Mississippi squadron on June 8, 1864, at which time he was suffering from typhoid fever. The illness worsened, and on November 8, at home in New York City, he died.'

    FOOTNOTE: '"The Bank of the United States will have forwarded to you pursuant to an arrangement with them Bills drawn by the Treasurer upon Amsterdam for Two hundred and fifty Thousand Guilders. It was my intention to have rendered the accommodation from these bills diffusive; in order to which it would be most agreeable to me if not more than ten thousand Dollars could be sold to one person or Copartnership. Not having signified this wish to the Bank, to save time, I convey it directly to you. I do not however make this an essential condition." The Panic of 1792--America''s first financial crash--occurred when the price of securities began dropping rapidly in January of that year, causing a panicked selloff in March. The crash in securities was largely due to the failed schemes of Hamilton''s friend, William Duer, and other prominent speculators who had attempted to corner the market on securities. As U.S. Treasurer, Hamilton successfully managed the resulting credit crisis by reviving the securities market; he did this by making open-market purchases of securities, providing banks with incentives to continue offering loans, and by permitting government bills of exchange to be purchased on credit. Less than a month after Hamilton wrote this letter, a group of securities brokers who hoped to avoid another panic signed the Buttonwood Agreement, establishing what would become the New York Stock Exchange.'

Additionally signed by U.S. Attorney for the District of New York Richard Harison. 1 page, 4to; minor abrasions at corners verso, folds.<\t>New York, 2 April 1798'
    FOOTNOTE: '"Considering that the award of the Referees in the case of Willinks and Bingham departs so widely from the expectation of the Constituents of LeRoy & Bayard, and that the same is contrary to the opinion of Mr. Tilghman, the Counsel who attended the hearing, as to the merits of the question as they appeared on that hearing, We think it advisable for Messrs LeRoy and Bayard, if Mr. Bingham as alleged is willing, to agree to set aside the award and open the controversy again to proceed in a court of law, or if Mr. Bingham is not so willing, to instruct their counsel to apply to the Court to set aside the award. Though there are different sides to the question we think upon the whole this is the most prudent course." In 1783, Hamilton founded a law practice in New York with Richard Harison, and in June of 1795, Hamilton''s firm was retained by merchants William Bayard and Herman LeRoy concerning a dispute between the Dutch bankers Wilhelm and Jan Willink on the one hand, and American statesman and land developer William Bingham on the other. The details of the dispute are unclear, but the Willinks and Bingham had been business partners in land speculation for a number of years beginning in 1792.'

    FOOTNOTE: '"I am informed that You are Assignees of Isaac Riley under the Insolvent Act. Some time since I purchased of Isaac Riley Eight lots in the Outward [outskirts of New York City] upon which as he then informed me there was a mortgage to Ebenezer Young for Two hundred & forty pounds which was deducted out of the purchase money & left to be paid by me pursuant to the Tenor of that mortgage. It appears that this mortgage was not recorded till within a fortnight past. In my opinion This will not defeat the right of Mr. Young''s Representations to receive payment from me in preference to the Trustees. But I have thought it right nevertheless to mention the affair to you. "If I do not within four days from the date of this letter, being the second of April, receive notice of a claim from the Trustees with the assurance of an Indemnification . . . , I shall act as if no such claim was intended to be made." The "Insolvent Act" is likely the New York State law, "An Act to amend the Act entitled an Act for the relief of Debtors with respect to the Imprisonment of their Persons," which became law the day prior to the writing of the present letter. In a letter to New York''s Lieutenant Governor Stephen Van Rensselaer on January 27, 1799, Hamilton discussed the bill, suggesting that, although the U.S. Constitution forbids state law that impairs the obligation of contracts, an acceptable law might be crafted according to which a debtor lawfully imprisoned by his creditors could be liberated, provided he satisfies certain conditions. Presumably Isaac Riley had been imprisoned for his debts, making the recipients of this letter his trustees.'

To party I am absolutely indifferent. I think much more of Man, than of a Whig or Democrat, & I gladly sympathize with all of any party, who have the good old cause at heart." Although it is unclear which case is referred to here by "D&S," it is likely that the "cause" mentioned in connection with freedom is the same cause to which Sumner refers in similar contexts repeatedly during 1852 and later. Sumner''s first major speech, "Freedom National; Slavery Sectional" (arguing for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Bill) was delivered only two months after writing this letter, in which he says of abolitionism: "All that I am or may be, I freely offer to this cause."'

The publicists claimed that Two Guns White Calf had been a model for the coin and employed him as a Park attraction, but there arose some controversy about whose portrait appeared on the nickel. The coin''s designer, James Earle Fraser, could not recall all the models used for the design, so the publicists could not be contradicted in their claim.'

Because of the U.S.''s lack of a navy (the first frigate authorized by the Naval Act of 1794 would not sail until May of 1798), commercial shipping relied upon Algerian protection, and because maintenance of revolutionary war debt had made cash difficult to obtain, payments from the U.S. were not always timely. The Crescent set sail for Algiers on January 18, 1798, arriving there in late February. Despite the gift and subsequent payments, American merchant ships in North African waters continued to be preyed upon by Barbary pirates until U.S. Navy ships arrived there in sufficient numbers in the 1820s.'

In the midst of the Great Depression, a number of international organizations had been founded to encourage cooperation in an effort to overcome the economic situation. One such organization was the International Congress on Commercial Education, which met for five days in London during the summer of 1932. In his speech addressing the Congress on July 30, the Prince of Wales stated that the "hard lesson of adversity has taught us all that the prosperity of all nations depended upon the prosperity of each. . . . If all the employable labor were employed for a reasonable number of hours per week, the world would have at its disposal a volume of commodities and services that would enable the entire population to live on a higher level of comfort and wellbeing than had ever been contemplated . . . ."'

I wish it were in my power to devise some scheme to make it increasingly difficult to heap them up beyond a certain amount. . . . [L]et us at least prevent their being bequeathed after death, or given . . . to any one man in excessive amount. "You and my other capitalist friends, on one side, shy off at what I say against them. Have you seen the frantic articles against me by [Eugene V.] Debs and the socialists of the bomb-throwing persuasion, on the other side, because of what I said in my speech in reference to those who, in effect, advocate murder?" 5 November 1906: ". . . Of course Root and I went over his speech word by word, and where he said he was authorized to speak he meant just exactly that--just exactly that he was authorized to use the very words he did. What a corker Root is, isn''t he?" With--Three typed letters from Roosevelt''s personal secretary William Loeb Jr. to Gary, thanking for his letter or a gift, or sending a copy of a speech [not present]. Each 1 page, 8vo, White House stationery. Washington, 23 June; 6 December 1906; 16 March 1907 • Retained drafts of 20 letters from Gary to Roosevelt or Leob. Together 34 pages, 4to, most onionskin paper. New York, 1906-08. On March 17, 1906, Roosevelt delivered an informal address at a dinner organized by House Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon for the Gridiron Club in Washington. In this speech, Roosevelt coined the term "muckraker" by comparing Bunyan''s image from Pilgrim’s Progress of a man fixated on his "muck rake" to a journalist who is unduly preoccupied with negative reportage. Although the speech was never published, Roosevelt delivered another soon after employing the same theme (“Address of President Roosevelt at the Laying of the Corner Stone of the Office Building of the House of Representatives Saturday, April 14, 1906”), published by the Government Printing Office that year. Much of the discussion in these letters concerns views of Roosevelt that can be found expressed in statements such as the following, taken from the later speech: "The wealthy man who exults because there is a failure of justice in the effort to bring some trust magnate to an account for his misdeeds is as bad as, and no worse than, the so-called labor leader who clamorously strives to excite a foul class feeling on behalf of some other labor leader who is implicated in murder."'

Typed Letter Signed, as President, to Editor of the New York Law Journal Archibald Watson, thanking for his article concerning an amendment to the U.S. Constitution abolishing the Electoral College, stating that he is aware of the importance that small states ascribe to their representation in the Senate and Electoral College, and agreeing with his analysis. 1 page, 4to, White House stationery, with integral blank; remnants of hinging at upper edge, horizontal fold.<\t>Washington, 12 May 1949'
    FOOTNOTE: '"I certainly appreciated most highly yours of the third, enclosing tear sheets from the New York Law Journal in regard to the amendment abolishing the Electoral College. "Having been in the Senate for ten years I, of course, am familiar with the extreme jealousies with which the small States regard their representation in the Senate and in the Electoral College. "You are exactly right in your analysis of the situation . . . ." In November 1948, although President Truman was widely expected to lose the presidential election to Governor Thomas E. Dewey, support for Truman swelled late in the campaign, winning him a second term. Truman received two million more popular votes than Dewey, but if there had been only slightly fewer popular votes in Ohio, California, and Illinois, the electors would likely have handed Dewey a victory. During that same year, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would eliminate the Electoral College’s role in presidential elections in favor of the popular vote in order to improve the role of the South in national politics—but the relevance of Lodge''s proposal to the 1948 election did not go unnoticed. The circumstances of that election might easily have resulted in electors choosing a candidate with fewer popular votes, or by the House of Representatives making the choice, since Truman nearly did not receive the absolute majority of electoral votes required by the Twelfth Amendment. Although Truman himself was initially doubtful about the wisdom of the Lodge amendment, when asked during a press conference on February 2, 1950 about Lodge’s resolution which passed the Senate the day before (S.J. Res. 2 of January 5, 1949), Truman said: “I think this resolution . . . is a forward step. . . . I have read all the records and all the hearings on it . . . . And I believe it would be a step in the right direction if the States choose to ratify the constitutional amendment.” The proposed amendment died, however, on July 17, 1950, when the House declined to bring the bill to the floor.'

I gave the Professor''s greetings to [Serge] Koussevitzky the day it arrived. By chance we met at the Soviet Consulate where [Vladimir] Horowitz was playing Prokofieff''s 8th Piano Sonata for a hand-picked audience. Kouss was obviously delighted to have word of his old friend. "For a while I thought I was going to be in Paris this spring.

It all fell through at the last moment . . . . ". . . I''m still working on my Symphony [No. 3] which didn''t progress much during the hectic winter months in N.Y. . . . On the side I''ve been preparing a Suite from the ballet I wrote for Martha Graham. She called it ''Appalachian Spring'' after a poem of Hart Crane. Only 2 days ago it won me a Pulitzer Prize. Isn''t that nice? . . ." 28 December 1945: ". . . I''ve been made ass''t director of the Berkshire Music Center up in Stockbridge. . . . "I''ve been reading lots of Henry James recently--and there are large chunks of Italy in his work. Tell me a little more in detail what life is like over there." 18 February 1946: ". . . I have a house and a Swedish lady cook out here and am still fussing with the Symphony. . . . In July I go to the Berkshire Music Center for six weeks. . . .

    FOOTNOTE: '"According to a letter received from my editors, Durand and Co. Place de la Madeleine, it appears that you reserve the right to authorize, or not, putting to music the poems of Stéphane Mallarmé. I did not know this detail, thinking that this question was handled among editors, without that, it could not be but agreeable for me to address myself directly you. Finally (at any rate), I have put to music the following poems: Soupir; Placet futile; Autre éventail (de Mademoiselle Mallarmé). "I have kept piously the most fervent admiration for the one who was truly ''our master.'' He is--perhaps without knowing it--a considerable influence on the very quiet musician that I was at the time when he did me the honor of receiving me in his home. And this fervor increases in gratitude in the remembrance of his kind welcome of the music for ''The Afternoon of a Faun''. These memories, among many others, will remain with me. I . . . ask you to facilitate the publication of these three melodies!" Published in Debussy, Correspondance, ed. Lesure and Herlin (Paris: Editions Gallimard, 2005), 1650. The first complete volume of Stèphane Mallarmé''s poetry was published in 1913, when both Debussy and Maurice Ravel independently began work setting select poems to music, including, astonishingly, two of the same poems. Ravel had already secured the rights to the poems from Mallarmé''s descendants before Debussy realized he must do the same, and when Ravel learned that Debussy requested rights to the some of the same poems, he did not insist upon retaining exclusive rights. Later that year, two works were published under the name Trois poèmes de Mallarmé: one by Debussy, the other by Ravel.'

All organizing on an anti-fascist basis is of decisive importance today." 15 March 1947: ". . . As far as ''Street Scene'' is concerned, . . . it is mostly written in lyrics which have to be translated to fit the music. I hear that Benatzky (who translated ''Porgy and Bess'') is interested in the job, but if you have any suggestions, please let me know. "Thanks for sending me the program of Dreigroschenoper in Hamburg. I heard from an American who saw the production and was very impressed. . . ." 6 August 1947: "I am just reading the Upton Sinclair script. Please call me . . . so that I can give you my impression of the play over the telephone." The German-American Writers Association was an anti-fascist organization founded in 1938 whose prominent members included Thomas Mann, Albert Einstein, and Upton Sinclair. The membership had become increasingly dominated by Russian Communist agents and in 1939, when members learned of the German-Russian nonaggression pact, many members resigned in protest. In 1942, when the Association became the German-American Emergency Conference, Thomas Mann, who had been the Association''s honorary president, resigned to join its rival, the German American Congress for Democracy. With--Two Autograph Letters Signed by Weill''s wife, Lotte Lenya, each to Kurt Hellmer, in English.

In the January 10, 1953, issue of Collier''s Weekly, an article of Steinbeck''s appeared: "The Secret Weapon We Were Afraid to Use." In the article, Steinbeck recounts the events during World War II when he, together with a friend, proposed to President Roosevelt a weapon that would defeat the enemy without harming the allies: first request that the U.S. Treasury print vast amounts of counterfeit enemy currency, then drop it over the enemy from the air. The resulting inflation, Steinbeck expected, would undermine the local economy without significant effect elsewhere; Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, however, found the idea outrageous. The article goes on to suggest that such a weapon could be employed against future enemies.'

Illustrated Autograph Letter Signed, "C Pissarro," to his son ("My dear Lucien"), in French, describing a work he has begun [View of Rouen or Lacroix Island at Rouen, (both 1883)?], encouraging him to take advantage of his time in London to copy works in the National Gallery, describing an encounter with a man who asked whether his young friend''s painting demonstrated talent and explaining that talent is not enough for success.

    FOOTNOTE: '"I am hard at work . . . . I began a work the motif of which is the river bank in the direction of St. Paul''s Church. Looking towards Rouen I have before me all the houses on the quays lighted by the morning sun, in the background the stone bridge, to the left the island with its houses, factories, boats, launches, to the right a mass of pinnaces of all colors. "In the evening I work at Le Cours-la-Reine on the motif you know about. . . . Yesterday, not having the sun, I began another work on the same motif in grey weather, only I looked more to the right. ". . . I have a room on the street. I shall start on a view of the street in fog for it has been foggy every morning until eleven o''clock-noon. It should be interesting, the square in the fog, the tramways, the goings and comings. "Until next time, then . . . work with ardor. You know that to succeed one must work hard. . . . Draw more and more often--remember Degas. If you want to make copies of the primitives, there are plenty of paintings in the National Gallery, there are the Egyptians, the Holbeins. Paint the figure; and don''t excuse weakness by the fear of drawing freely in public. "Yesterday, . . . a little rentier pestered me . . . . [He] spoke to me about a young man of nineteen, from this neighborhood, . . . . [who] is full of ardor and has invincible faith . . . and he is going to Paris . . . . So I was asked to go and look at a portrait done by this young man. Another painter who will be swallowed up in Paris, or is he strong enough to resist? has he talent? Pardon me, talent is not what is required, everybody has talent nowadays. . . . "Here comes the sun, I must leave you until next time. Published in Pissarro, Letters to His Son Lucien, ed. John Rewald (New York: Pantheon, 1943), 40-42. Provenance: Lucien Pissarro, the artist''s eldest son, London; thence by gift to Mr. and Mrs. Paul M. Hirschland, New York, acquired with the assistance of their friend John Rewald (the Hirschlands owned the second view of Rouen oil painting discussed in this letter); thence by descent to the current owner. Lucien Pissarro and his wife Esther remained close friends with the Hirschlands, throughout World War II they sent frequent care packages to the Pissarros.'

Shortly after Dickens arrived in Boston in late January 1842 a dinner was held in his honor on February 1st at Papanti''s Dancing Academy on Tremont Row, and was to be the public climax of Dickens''s reception in Boston. Prominent guests included Josiah Quincy, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Washington Allston, and Richard Henry Dana, Jr. A survey of Rare Book Hub and ABPC yields four similar copies inscribed by Dickens on or about the present date sold at auction, including one other copy inscribed to an attendee at the present dinner (Josiah Quincy). Dana''s claim to literary fame, Two Years Before the Mast, had been published to favorable reviews to an uncredited Dana in September 1840. Provenance: includes a holograph transmittal letter by Dana''s grand daughter Elizabeth Ellery Dana: "I wish this book (in two volumes) to go to my nephew Richard H.

His architectural drawings of Seljuk and Ottoman monuments around the country show their original appearance at a time when some pashas preferred the "modernist" French and German aesthetic. Rare to find both volumes available together, with the second part unrecorded in some major references; apparently Raymond applied the series title to the first part retrospectively.
