    <br><br>Paris: [Chez Jacques Lagniet], 1657-1663.<br><br>First edition,
    quarto, entirely engraved, this copy consisting of 114 engraved full page
    allegorical and satirical plates telling amusing stories, offering
    instruction, casting aspersions, and meting out social commentary; the
    plates are each numbered in three separate sections, lacking the following
    plates, with blanks bound in their stead; I: lacking plates 19, 23, & 34 [47
    plates]; II: lacking plates 7, 19, 30, 35, & 40 [37 plates]; III: lacking
    plate 17 [29 plates]; and one additional plate of similar genre and period,
    totaling 114 plates in all; bound in later half leather and textured cloth
    boards, the William Stirling copy, with his arms tooled in blind on the
    front board and his large bookplate inside the front board, many plates with
    neatly extended fore-margins, generally well-preserved internally, with a
    long bibliographic note neatly written and professionally tipped onto blanks
    bound before the first title; 10 1/8 x 7 1/2 in.<br><br>The bibliographical
    story of this rare collection of prints is complex. Extant collections
    contain varying numbers. Often, as is the case here, unnumbered supplemental
    plates of uncertain origin are also included. We can state that 114 plates
    are present in this volume, and account for the absence of specific numbers,
    but the ultimate number of plates in each of the three series is not known
    with complete certainty.<br><br>Lagniet, in his clever, irreverent, and
    often biting visual commentary, shows countless details of daily life in his
    country in the mid-17th century. We see people of all genders, classes,
    abilities, and ages in a myriad of scenarios, including even the antics of
    domesticated cats and dogs, farm animals, and numerous donkeys. Whether
    drinking and smoking at a bar, roasting meat on a spit, begging for alms,
    engaging in a brawl, or getting scratched by a cat, Lagniet shows it all.
    His complicated compositions invariably include multiple characters, each of
    whom is depicted as a fully-realized identity, with variations in dress,
    face, and action. The artist's inventiveness is hard to capture. As an
    example, one plate features two squatting characters [Ces Deux Amis] baring
    their bottoms and passing gas onto a burning candle, illustrating goodness
    knows what.<br><br>Destailleur 325; Brunet III 767; Rahir 590; rare at

    his medical degree on the continent, and his knowledge of French, Italian,
    German, and Spanish cuisine is on display in this work, in addition to his
    conversancy with his native dishes. He begins with a discussion of diet in
    general and dedicates subsequent chapters to the health effects of the
    consumption of wild and tame flesh, birds, organ meat, milk and other dairy
    products, eggs, blood, fish, fruits of orchard, garden, and field, and even
    includes a discussion of breadmaking, salt, sugar, and spice. He concludes
    with his thoughts on what quantity and quality of meat one ought to eat, and
    finally "the time, order, and manner of eating." Much of the incidental
    information conveyed by Moffett regarding daily life is not found disclosed
    in other published works of the period. For example, he names varieties of
    fowl kept on farms, a true list of 17th century British heritage breeds.
    Regional and national traditions and preferences are also noted. "Cowbiefe
    is supposed by the Irish people, and also by the Normans in France to be
    best of all: neither do they account so much Oxen; either because they think
    them unperfit creatures, or rather (as I take it) because they know not how
    to use and diet them in the gelding." (page 60)<br><br>Wing M-2382; Thomason

    in.<br><br>The economic turmoil of the Great Depression prompted many to
    question the wisdom of allowing an unregulated free market to self-correct.
    Keynes suggested that a cash-starved economy would continue to perpetuate
    the downward slide. His sustained criticism of existing economic theory
    carried great influence. "I believe myself to be writing a book on economic
    theory which will largely revolutionize-- not I suppose, at once but in the
    course of the next ten years --the way the world thinks about its economic
    problems. I can't expect [...] anyone to believe this at the present stage.
    But for myself I don't merely hope what I say, in my own mind, I'm quite
    sure." (see John Cassidy's "The Demand Doctor," The New Yorker, 3 October
    2011, quoting a letter Keynes wrote to George Bernard Shaw on 1 January
    1935, referring to the present work.)

    marbled paper boards, generally good, sizes vary, 8 3/4 x 5 1/4
    in.<br><br>This series of pamphlets begins with speeches in the famous
    Webster-Hayne debate, which erupted in the Senate between Webster of
    Massachusetts and Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina between January 19th and
    27th, 1830. Ostensibly beginning with a spirited discussion of the pros and
    cons of protectionist tariffs, the speeches delivered in the course of this
    imbroglio were spontaneously conceived and orated by both. The debate itself
    was originally inspired by Samuel A. Foot of Connecticut's call for a
    temporary suspension of land surveying in a move to stop the government
    selling new plots of land.<br><br>Webster's Second Reply to Hayne, the third
    work in the present collection, is regarded as the most eloquent speech ever
    delivered in Congress. In it, he writes: "It is the People's Constitution,
    the People's Government; made for the People, made by the People, and
    answerable to the People," (see page 61) a phrase lightly retooled by
    Lincoln in the Gettysburg Address. Webster ends with this: "the sentiment,
    dear to every true American heart [is] --Liberty and Union, now and forever,
    one and inseparable!" (see page 85). His stirring words are the source of
    North Dakota's state motto.<br><br>Former owner of these pamphlets, Charles
    Marsh, served as United States Attorney for the District of Vermont from
    1797 until 1801, and was nominated to that office by George Washington. He
    was also a member of Congress from 1815 to 1817, where he served as
    Vermont's at-large representative in the House. The building that served as
    his law office in 1797 Woodstock, Vermont still stands today, the oldest
    detached law office in Vermont.

    & Co., 1898.<br><br>First edition, four large quarto volumes in original

    paper labels on spines and front panels of each, 12 x 10 1/8 in.
    (4)<br><br>Lowell did extensive work between 1893 and 1908 on his study of
    Mars. This work includes many images of Lowell's renderings of the canals on
    the surface of Mars, which he deemed, "non-natural features" that suggested
    to him the work of an intelligent lifeform. Lowell called the features
    "canals" because he thought they had been dug by inhabitants attempting to
    reach the planet's ice caps during a profound drought. Today, it is settled
    science that the features on Mars are not made by an intelligent form of
    life, and that the images Lowell spied through telescopes appeared as they
    did because of an optical illusion and other factors. Although Lowell's work
    on Mars failed to give much to astronomy, his imaginative interpretations
    did inform science fiction. Beginning with H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds in
    1898, the image aliens fleeing a dying Mars and striking out into the
    universe to save themselves through desperate measures entered the
    collective imagination and fueled dozens of other works of fiction,
    including Heinlein's Red Planet, Burroughs' The God of Mars, Bradbury's
    Martian Chronicles, and others.

    ab Aquapendente he became official physician of his home town of Ulm. His
    remarkable textbook on surgery, the ‘Armamentarium chirurgicum’ was first
    published 10 years after his death and passed through many editions and
    translations all over Europe. This work contains a complete catalogue of
    surgical instruments, illustrated demonstrations of a variety of operative
    procedures and 100 case reports. The success of Scultetus’ publication was
    responsible for an improved standard of the education of the non-academic
    barber surgeons, who were treating the majority of the population, and was a
    significant milestone for the development of surgery as an academic
    speciality." (cf. Dirk Schultheiss & Uro Jonas's "Johannes Scultetus,"

  TYPESET: >-

    1527].<br><br>First edition in French, small folio, illustrated with three
    very large (nearly full-page) woodcuts; text printed in gothic letter,
    attractive set of woodcut initials used throughout; bound in full 19th
    century calf by Koehler; the final leaf, blank but for printer's woodcut

    in.<br><br>Caviceo's romance was first published in Italian in 1508 and was
    very popular. The tale of Peregrino and his love Genevera follows the now
    classic "star-crossed" motif, long before Shakespeare explored the theme.
    "Caviceo tells their tale with brio in a delightful array of narrative
    modes, including amatory epistles, philosophical digressions that anticipate
    later Renaissance dialogues in love treatises, autobiographical references,
    seemingly realistic courtroom dramas, and outlandish tales. After Peregrino
    endures many trials, including abduction by pirates, dangerous trips to the
    Orient and to Hell, almost insurmountable obstacles erected by Genevera's
    family, and wild intrigues of all kinds, the bumbling protagonist finally
    unites in marriage with his beloved." (Quoted from Sherry Roush's Speaking
    Spirits: Ventriloquizing the Dead in Renaissance Italy, University of
    Toronto Press, 2015, page 118 ff.)<br><br>Brunet I, 1701-1702; not in Adams

    Portugal were pretending to be Catholic. Next, systematically infiltrate the
    medical profession, murder "real" Catholics, and use the profession to cover
    up the killings. Costa Mattos proposed that Portuguese Jews could thereby
    blot out Christianity and with it the monarchies of Portugal and Spain. (cf.

    controversy surrounding the Crown's requirement that all subjects, including
    Roman Catholics, swear an Oath of Allegiance to James I. A convert from
    Catholicism to Protestantism himself, Donne's maternal grandfather went into
    exile and his stepfather was jailed, both for failing to take the very same
    oath. In this light our author throws himself into squaring this particular
    circle. Employing a variety of rhetorical angles, he argues that the Oath of
    Allegiance could be understood as more of a political than a religious
    agreement, allowing for individual religious freedom and not necessarily
    precluding a belief in Catholicism. The title suggests that English
    Catholics need not consider the Oath as anything akin to actual martyrdom,
    unlike Christians persecuted in Ancient Rome.<br><br>STC 7048; Keynes 1;

    11 1/4 x 7 1/2 in.<br><br>An early romance originally written in Portuguese,
    The Seven Books of Diana was first published in its original language in
    1559. It popularized the theme of shepherd and shepherdess romances and was
    followed by many imitators. Shakespeare is thought to have been a reader, as
    the plot involving Proteus, Julia, and Silvia from Two Gentlemen of Verona
    was borrowed from "Felismena's Tale" in Diana. This particular edition
    includes translations of the second part of Diana by Alonso Pérez, and of
    Gaspar Gil Polo's Diana Enamorata, all by Bartholomew Yong
    (1560-1621?).<br><br>STC 18044; ESTC S122233.<br><br>From the Ken Rapoport

    the second part, by Pedro de la Sierra in 1580, and parts three and four by
    Marcos Martinez, in 1587/8. The Espejo de Principes y Cavalleros was
    translated into English as The Mirrour of Knighthood, which influenced much
    English literature, including Spenser's Faerie Queene and Shakespeare's The
    Tempest. Utterson, a literary antiquary and original member of the Roxburgh
    Club, established a private press at Beldornie Tower, his home on the Isle
    of Wight. Utterson was particularly interested in English and Spanish
    romances, and published many himself.<br><br>Palau 82343; Brunet IV:246; D.

    Father Cubero in his capacity as a Catholic missionary. He wandered the
    globe for decades, beginning as Apostolic Preacher to Asia and the East
    Indies, which brought him across Russia and the Middle East on his way to
    Goa and Madras. Cubero made most of his route by land, allowing firsthand
    observations of local dress, religion, languages, and customs of the people
    he visited, all of which he describes in detail. The second part is
    dedicated to his experiences traveling in Europe, including his descriptions

    not hold a high opinion of the newly minted country he visited, he was on
    the ground at a critical time in the nation's history. His text also
    includes an account of the trade in enslaved humans abducted from Africa. A
    quick read of his chapter summaries gives a picture of his opinions about
    American culture. For example, "Chapter II: Excessive Heat--Bed Bugs &
    Mosquitoes--Bunker's Hill--the Death of Major Pitcairn--Vaults containing
    the Remains of the Officers who fell at the Battle of Bunker's Hill." He
    also includes statistical information, descriptions of natural history, and
    biographical sketches of Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, John Paul Jones,
    Benedict Arnold, and other heroes of the Revolution. An exhaustive and
    fascinating work, this cataloguer feels the topic of chapter XXII still
    resonates, "Deplorable Effects of the uncontrolled Liberty allowed to Youth
    in America--Smoking--An Academic
    Frolic--Slingers--Eleveners--Gouging--Biting--Kicking."
