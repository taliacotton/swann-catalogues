    Private collection. <br><br>David Hare showed at Saidenberg Gallery from
    1960 - 1964, with five one person exhibitions in that time period. The
    title, Barree, may possibly refer to the French artist, Martin Barre. Hare
    is known for his creative license with spelling. During the time period when
    this work was created, the artist divided his time between New York and
    paris, interacting with intellectuals and artists in both cities. Barre and
    hare shared similar concepts about art, and it is within reason David hare
    would honor his fellow artist with an enigmatic sculpture of his own.

    left Paris in 1940 and moved to New York City where he shared a studio with
    Surrealist artist Yves Tanguy until around 1945. He is best known for his
    geometric, cubist influenced work of the forties. In 1947 he participated in
    the International Surrealist Exhibition, Galerie Maeght, Paris. Perkins
    returned to Nashville in 1948 where he taught at the University of

    two-year fellowship from the School of International Painting in Sergovia,
    Spain. For the next four years Perkins lived, painted and exhibited in Spain
    and on the Isle of Ibiza. Perkins returned to Paris to live and paint in
    1959 only to return to Nashville again two years later. Philip Perkins died
    in Nashville in 1970. (Gary Snyder Fine Art, NY)
