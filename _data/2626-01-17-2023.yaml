  TYPESET: >-
    <br>Black and sepia ink with gouache highlights on paper. Signed,
    <i>Laning,</i> lower right. 356x260 mm; 14x10¼ inches. <br><br>Edward Laning
    had a rich career as artist and illustrater creating numerous commissioned
    works.  Funded by the Treasury Section of Fine Arts (TSFA) he completed a

    Progress Administration Laning created murals for the dining hall in the
    Administration Building at Ellis Island, (partially destroyed with remaining
    works moved to the Brooklyn Courthouse), and perhaps his most spectacular
    murlas created for the main branch of the New York Public Library's McGraw

    Edition of approximately 20.  Signed and numbered "19" in pencil, lower
    margin. 1932.<br><br>A brilliant, early impression of this scarce print with
    strong contrasts.  Sasowsky 139. <br><br>Born in Paris, the second son in a
    well-to-do family, Marsh attended Yale University and then moved to New York
    where, during the early 1920s, he worked as an illustrator and took classes
    at the Art Students League. Marsh was equally influenced by his art teachers
    in New York, notably John Sloan (1871-1951), as well as American
    Regionalists like Thomas Hart Benton (1889-1975) and Old Masters such as
    Rubens, Titian and Tintoretto. He wholly rejected the modern artistic
    movements gaining strength in America at the time-Cubism, Surrealism,
    Abstraction. Instead he pursued a style that is best summed up as social
    realism: depictions of everyday life in New York, Coney Island beach scenes,
    vaudeville and burlesque women, the jobless on the streets of New York and
    the railroad yards and freight trains in New York and New Jersey. <br><br>He
    participated in the federal art programs under the WPA, painting two murals
    in Washington, DC, and, funded by the Treasury Relief Art Project, completed
    a series of frescoes in the New York Customs House, now the National Museum
    of the American Indian, that depict eight New York Harbor scenes and eight
    portraits of great navigators. It is one of the most celebrated mural
    installations created under the New Deal in New York City.

    good impression of this scarce lithograph. We have found only 7 other
    impressions at auction in the past 30 years. <br><br>An artist as well as an
    actress, Markham's works seek out every day dramas, assisted by her use of
    high contrast and shadows. Markham attended the Art Institute of Chicago
    from 1907 to 1909, when she left the Institute to work at Chicago's Little
    Theater and later with the Provincetown Players in Massachusetts. She became
    an illustrator to supplement her acting career and in 1930 attended classes
    at the Art Students League in New York, where she started to work in
    lithography. Her employment with the Federal Art Project in 1936 coincided
    with what are considered the finest examples of her lithographic
    <i>œuvre</i>. The New York <i>Herald Tribune</i> named Markham among the
    Federal Art Project's Graphic Arts Division artists who "assist particularly
    in carrying on the project's graphic work to a success unsurpassed by any of
    its other departments" after viewing the spring 1937 exhibition of "Recent
    Fine Prints" at the Federal Art Project Gallery in New York.

    first visited New Mexico in 1925 and returned numerous times throughout the
    1920s, 1930s and 1940s.  Kloss received widespread recognition and awards
    during the 1930s.  From 1933 to 1944 she was the sole etcher employed by the
    Public Works of Art Project.  Her series of nine New Mexico scenes from that
    period were reproduced and distributed to public schools across the state. 
    She also created watercolors and oil paintings for the WPA.  In 1935, she
    was one of three Taos artists who represented New Mexico at a Paris
    exhibition called "Three Centuries of Art in the United States."

    Philip Reisman through their school's art club. He took art classes at the
    Brooklyn Museum and attended the Art Students League. In 1926 Sternberg and
    Reisman learned etching under Harry Wickey.  After some success as an
    artist, Sternberg was hired to teach etching, lithography, and composition
    at the Art Students League in 1933. It is around this time that Sternberg
    became active in artists' rights organizations, creating the American
    Artists Congress, and later as a member of the Artists Equity Association.
    In 1935 Sternberg began working as the technical advisor for the Graphic
    Arts Division of the Federal Art Project. During his time there he completed
    three murals. In 1937, <i>Carrying the Mail</i> for the Sellersville,

    Sasowsky 15.<br><br>Born in Paris, the second son in a well-to-do family,
    Marsh attended Yale University and then moved to New York where, during the
    early 1920s, he worked as an illustrator and took classes at the Art
    Students League. Marsh was equally influenced by his art teachers in New
    York, notably John Sloan (1871-1951), as well as American Regionalists like
    Thomas Hart Benton (1889-1975) and Old Masters such as Rubens, Titian and
    Tintoretto. He wholly rejected the modern artistic movements gaining
    strength in America at the time--Cubism, Surrealism, Abstraction. Instead,
    he pursued a style that is best summed up as social realism: depictions of
    everyday life in New York, Coney Island beach scenes, vaudeville and
    burlesque women, the jobless on the streets of New York and the railroad
    yards and freight trains in New York and New Jersey.<br><br>He participated
    in the federal art programs under the WPA, painting two murals in
    Washington, D.C., and, funded by the Treasury Relief Art Project, completed
    a series of frescoes in the New York Customs House, now the National Museum
    of the American Indian, that depict eight New York Harbor scenes and eight
    portraits of great navigators. It is one of the most celebrated mural
    installations created under the New Deal in New York City.

    and studied at the Municipal School of Applied Arts, Cologne, and the
    Academy of Graphic Arts, Leipzig. He learned various forms of printmaking
    during his studies and apprenticed for a printer. He worked as an
    illustrator in Germany, but in 1933, as Nazi Germany rose to power, he
    immigrated to the United States. He participated in the Federal Arts Project
    during the 1930s, and had a successful career as a book illustrator and
    teacher at the New School for Social Research, Pratt Institute and the
    University of Rhode Island. Eichenberg's urban scenes of New York from the
    1930s captured the essence of the bustling, growing city.

    57.<br><br>This print depicts a life drawing class at The Whitney Studio
    Club, with portraits of artists including Mabel Dwight (far left with the
    hat), George O. "Pop" Hart (with pipe and glasses) and Bacon herself
    (wearing glasses, left background). <br><br>Bacon was best known for her
    realistic representations of everyday life and her satirical caricatures.
    She studied at the Art Students League, New York, with Kenneth Hayes Miller,
    John Sloan and George Bellows, and taught herself drypoint there in between
    drawing classes. Looking back at her time at the League, Bacon said, "The
    years at the Art Students League were a very important chunk of life to me
    and very exhilarating. It was the first time in my life, of course, that I
    had met and gotten to know familiarly a group of young people who were all
    headed the same way with the same interests. In fact it was practically
    parochial." From the 1910s to the 1930s, she worked mainly in drypoint
    printmaking and also doing illustrations for the satirical magazine <i>Bad
    News</i>, while her later drawings appeared as illustrations in publications
    including <i>The New Yorker, New Republic, Fortune and Vanity Fair</i>. She
    further went on to illustrate over 60 books, 19 of which she also wrote.
    <br><br>Bacon exhibited frequently in New York from the 1910s onward, with
    galleries including Alfred Stieglitz's Intimate Gallery, the Weyhe Gallery
    and the Downtown Gallery (she had more than 32 solo exhibitions during her
    career), and was closely connected with other artists with ties to these
    galleries, including Katherine Schmidt and Yasuo Kuniyoshi.

    <br><br>Gwathmey is one of the most celebrated painter-printmakers of
    African-American life in the southern United States. As an outsider to the

    picturesque scenes of everyday life. He managed unbiasedly to imbue humanity
    and an unromanticized dignity into his subjects. <br><br>In 1941 Gwathmey
    was commissioned by the Treasury Section of Fine Arts to comeplete a mural,
    <i>The Countryside</i> for the post office in Eutaw, Alabama.

  CROSSHEAD: '<i>Isaac L. Rice, Esq</i>.'
  TYPESET: >-
    <br>Etching.  357x279 mm; 14x11 inches, full margins.  Third state (of 3). 
    Edition of only 25 (from an intended edition of 100).  Signed and inscribed
    "100 proofs" in pencil, lower margin.  1915. <br><br>A superb impression of
    this large, scarce etching.<br><br>A New York attorney specializing in
    corporate law and patents, Rice (1850-1915) was also a renowned chess
    player.  He sponsored chess tournaments and invented a chess move known as
    the "Rice Gambit."  Morse 178.<br><br>The WPA gave opportunities and
    financial help to many artists who were struggling during the Depression. 
    Sloan, already an established artist and teacher at the Art Students League
    (who taught many artists who particapted in the WPA programs), did not fit
    that profile, but he did participate in the Treasury Section of Fine Arts,
    which hired well-known artists for its projects.  He painted the mural
    <i>The Arrival of the First Mail in Bronxville in 1846</i> for the post
    office in Bronxville, New York.  He also created two paintings for the WPA,
    one <i>The Wigwam, Old Tammany Hall</i>, now in the collection of the
    Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the other <i>Fourteenth Street at
    Sixth Avenue</i>, originally hung the office of U.S. Senator Royal Copeland
    and now is exhibited at the Detroit Insitute of Arts.

    Walker Evans. (Shahn’s entrée to photography was a studio space shared with
    Evans in 1929.) Shahn traveled across rural America photographing the plight
    of the communities there and capturing the strength of will of their
    residents.

    <br>Etching.  355x279 mm; 14x11 inches, full margins.  Eighth state (of 8). 
    Edition of 60 (from an intended edition of 100).  Signed and inscribed "100
    proofs" in pencil, lower margin.  1931.  <br><br>A superb, richly-inked
    impression with strong contrasts.    Morse 246.  <br><br>According to Morse,
    approximately 30 impressions were pulled from the plate in the seventh state
    and another 30 were taken in the eighth state, which differs in the heavy
    diagonal shading in the plate upper right, to account for the total
    published edition of 60. <br><br>Sloan made this portrait as a memorial to
    his teacher, mentor and friend, fellow Ashcan artist Robert Henri
    (1865-1929).  Henri had died unexpectedly, after being hospitalized at St.
    Luke's Hospital in New York, of cardiac arrest early in the morning of July
    12, 1929.  His sudden death had a strong impact on the scores of artists he
    had taught and mentored for several decades, including Sloan, George
    Bellows, Rockwell Kent, Stuart Davis, and Edward Hopper.  The artist and
    student of Henri,  Eugene Speicher said, "Not only was he a great painter,
    but . . . I don't think it too much to call him the father of independent
    painting in this country."<br><br>Sloan based the current work, one of his
    largest portrait etchings, on a drawing he had made of Henri in 1905, now in
    the collection of the Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery, University of Nebraska,
    Lincoln.  In his diary, Sloan noted, "I am pleased with the plate and hope
    that it conveys some of the kindly strength and helpful wisdom which this
    great artists so freely gave toothers."

    lithographs."<br><br>Soyer was born in Russia and immigrated to New York at
    the age of twelve. He studied at Cooper Union, the National Academy of
    Design and with Guy Pène du Bois (1884-1958) at the Art Students League.  He
    is known as a Social Realist, depicting the daily struggles of those living
    in New York City.  His chosen subject matter became especially poignant at
    the onset of the Great Depression, and, after he began to exhibit his work
    in the late 1920s, he cemented his reputation among the top American realist
    artists of the 20th century.

    Bacon saw at the Uffizi, Florence and Louvre, Paris, respectively.
    <br><br>Bacon was best known for her realistic representations of everyday
    life and her satirical caricatures. She studied at the Art Students League,
    New York, with Kenneth Hayes Miller, John Sloan and George Bellows, and
    taught herself drypoint there in between drawing classes. Looking back at
    her time at the League, Bacon said, "The years at the Art Students League
    were a very important chunk of life to me and very exhilarating. It was the
    first time in my life, of course, that I had met and gotten to know
    familiarly a group of young people who were all headed the same way with the
    same interests. In fact it was practically parochial." From the 1910s to the
    1930s, she worked mainly in drypoint printmaking and also doing
    illustrations for the satirical magazine <i>Bad News</i>, while her later
    drawings appeared as illustrations in publications including <i>The New
    Yorker, New Republic, Fortune and Vanity Fair</i>. She further went on to
    illustrate over 60 books, 19 of which she also wrote. <br><br>Bacon
    exhibited frequently in New York from the 1910s onward, with galleries
    including Alfred Stieglitz's Intimate Gallery, the Weyhe Gallery and the
    Downtown Gallery (she had more than 32 solo exhibitions during her career),
    and was closely connected with other artists with ties to these galleries,
    including Katherine Schmidt and Yasuo Kuniyoshi.

    comradery created in such a setting. The group shows, print workshops, and
    large scale easel projects allowed artists to work together, socialize, and
    exchange ideas. The Ten was a group of progressive thinking artists that
    banded together to find strength in numbers so that they could express
    themselves freely through their art work and exhibit their works on their
    own terms. Ben-Zion, Ilya Bolotowsky, Adolph Gottlieb, Louis harris, Yankel
    Kufeld, Mark Rothko, Louis Schanker, Joseph Solman, and Nahum Tschacbasov
    were the original members of this important American artist's collective.

    prints of the Western landscape and ceremonies of the Pueblo people.  She
    first visited New Mexico in 1925 and returned numerous times throughout the
    1920s, 1930s and 1940s.  Kloss received widespread recognition and awards
    during the 1930s.  From 1933 to 1944 she was the sole etcher employed by the
    Public Works of Art Project.  Her series of nine New Mexico scenes from that
    period were reproduced and distributed to public schools across the state. 
    She also created watercolors and oil paintings for the WPA.  In 1935, she
    was one of three Taos artists who represented New Mexico at a Paris
    exhibition called "Three Centuries of Art in the United States."

    was already seen as a leader in the Regionalist movement and a celebrated
    muralist by the time the WPA started the Federal Arts Program. He had been
    commissioned to paint murals of life in Indiana for the 1933 Century of
    Progress Exhibition in Chicago, which caused controversy. In 1934, his work
    was featured on the cover on Time magazine, which legitimized Regionalism as
    an art movement. His murals were influential for the artists hired as
    muralists under the WPA.

    Claiming, “photography is a universal language, transcending the boundaries
    of race, politics, and nationality,” Arthur Rothstein documented American
    life in black-and-white photographs both artful and direct. A founding
    member of the Photo League, he believed that documentary photography was a
    tool for social change. He began his career as a photographer with the
    Resettlement Administration (later the Farm Security Administration),
    bringing the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression into the public eye. During
    this time, he took his most iconic photograph, Dust Storm, Cimarron County,
    Oklahoma (1936), which became emblematic of the Dust Bowl. Rothstein served
    as a Signal Corps photographer during WWII, and documented the Great Famine
    in China in 1946–47. Back in the U.S., he spent the remainder of his career
    editing photographs for Look and Parade and teaching the craft he had
    mastered so beautifully.

    <br>Drypoint.  247x300 mm; 9⅞x11⅞ inches, full margins.    Signed "Martin
    Lewis P.L." by the artist's daughter-in-law, Patricia Lewis, lower right. 
    Printed by Edna Myers, Montreal.  1949, printed circa 1982. <br><br>A very
    good, richly-inked impression of this scarce print with dark contrasts.
    <br><br>According to McCarron, "<i>Late Traveler</i> is remarkable for the
    black tones that make up the kiosks, in particular their fish-scale
    patterned roofs, which are difficult to see except in the strongest light. 
    All subway kiosks, like those depicted by Lewis, were torn down by the City
    of New York.  A reconstructed example, built by the city at great expense,
    stands at Astor Place and Fourth Avenue, the entrace to the Astor Place
    station of the Lexington Avenue line."  McCarron 143.

    <br><br>Kuniyoshi, born in Okayama, Japan came to the United States in 1906,
    settling in New York after briefly exploring the West Coast. During the
    mid-1930s, he worked in the graphics division of the Federal Arts Project
    while exhibiting his work internationally. Though his work was characterized
    as poetic and surreal, his fantastic scenes turned somber during World War
    II while he worked with the Office of War Information

    Surrealism, Abstraction. Instead he pursued a style that is best summed up
    as social realism: depictions of everyday life in New York, Coney Island
    beach scenes, vaudeville and burlesque women, the jobless on the streets of
    New York and the railroad yards and freight trains in New York and New
    Jersey. <br><br>He participated in the federal art programs under the WPA,
    painting two murals in Washington, DC, and, funded by the Treasury Relief
    Art Project, completed a series of frescoes in the New York Customs House,
    now the National Museum of the American Indian, that depict eight New York
    Harbor scenes and eight portraits of great navigators. It is one of the most
    celebrated mural installations created under the New Deal in New York City.

    10/20 in pencil, lower margin.  1940.<br><br>A very good impression of this
    extremely scarce lithograph.  Flint 185.<br><br>Lozowick was born in
    Ludvinovka, a small village near Kiev and moved to the larger city of Kiev
    with his brother as a child. He studied at the Kiev Art School before
    following his brother again to New York in 1906 where he settled in New
    Jersey, got a job at a factory, and learned English. He continued his
    studies, at the National Academy of Design, taking courses with Emil Carlsen
    and Leon Kroll. They pushed Lozowick to seek a personal viewpoint in his
    artwork beyond the traditional training. He took a break from making art
    while he was a student at Ohio State University and joined the army during
    World War I.<br><br>The modern European art movements had a profound effect
    on Lozowick, and between 1920 and 1924 he traveled to Europe and spent time
    meeting modern artists and enmeshing himself into artistic and cultural
    communities. He was particularly drawn to Cubist and Futurist styles, and in
    1923, when he was introduced to lithography, he applied their principles to
    American subject matter.<br><br>Lozowick was among a small group of artists,
    including Jan Matulka and Howard Cook, who depicted the industrial city.
    Embracing these European movements while choosing specifically American
    subject matter was typical of Precisionism, and while artists like  Charles
    Sheeler and Ralston Crawford never organized, they shared the approach of
    paring down their compositions to the simplest of forms. After the fall of
    the stock market and as the country turned towards despair in the 1930s,
    Lozowick adapted his concept of the city. Along with many artists, he turned
    toward depicting the social reality of its residents who were affected by
    the Depression. Throughout his career, New York remained his primary subject
    matter, and he reflected in 1943, “From the innumerable choices which our
    complex and tradition-laden civilization presents to the artist, I have
    chosen one which seems to suit my training and temperament. I might
    characterize it this: ‘Industry harnessed by Man for the Benefit of
    Mankind.’”

    Printed by George Miller, New York. 1934.<br><br>A very good impression of
    this extremely scarce lithograph. Robinson/Pirog 73.<br><br>Dwight
    (1876-1955) was born in Cincinnati and travelled extensively as a child and
    young adult. She studied at the Hopkins School of Art in San Francisco in
    the late 1890s, though gave up her nascent reputation as an artist once she
    was married in 1906. In 1917, she separated from her husband and resumed
    painting, joining the Whitney Studio Club in New York. With the
    encouragement of Carl Zigrosser, who often urged American artists to make a
    pilgrimage to the Atelier Desjobert, she traveled to Paris in 1927 to learn
    lithography. He said of her, "Dwight did not just skim the surface of the
    comic and incongruous, but probed into the depths, ever imbued with pity and
    compassion, a sense of irony, and the understanding that comes of profound
    experience... There is detachment also, the sense of seeing life from afar,
    the long view of things." After returning to New York, her mature style
    blossomed, blending social realist subjects with her unique brand of satire.
    In 1928, she produced her first American lithographs and printed 17 works in
    collaboration with George Miller. She went on to produce lithographs for the
    Federal Arts Projects during the Great Depression.

    Francisco in the late 1890s, though gave up her nascent reputation as an
    artist once she was married in 1906. In 1917, she separated from her husband
    and resumed painting, joining the Whitney Studio Club in New York. With the
    encouragement of Carl Zigrosser, who often urged American artists to make a
    pilgrimage to the Atelier Desjobert, she traveled to Paris in 1927 to learn
    lithography. He said of her, "Dwight did not just skim the surface of the
    comic and incongruous, but probed into the depths, ever imbued with pity and
    compassion, a sense of irony, and the understanding that comes of profound
    experience... There is detachment also, the sense of seeing life from afar,
    the long view of things." After returning to New York, her mature style
    blossomed, blending social realist subjects with her unique brand of satire.
    In 1928, she produced her first American lithographs and printed 17 works in
    collaboration with George Miller. She went on to produce lithographs for the
    Federal Arts Projects during the Great Depression.

    <br><br>Lozowick (1892-1973) was born in Ludvinovka, a small village near
    Kiev and moved to the larger city of Kiev with his brother as a child. He
    studied at the Kiev Art School before following his brother again to New
    York in 1906 where he settled in New Jersey, got a job at a factory, and
    learned English. He continued his studies, at the National Academy of
    Design, taking courses with Emil Carlsen and Leon Kroll. They pushed
    Lozowick to seek a personal viewpoint in his artwork beyond the traditional
    training. He took a break from making art while he was a student at Ohio
    State University and joined the army during World War I.<br><br>The modern
    European art movements had a profound effect on Lozowick, and between 1920
    and 1924 he traveled to Europe and spent time meeting modern artists and
    enmeshing himself into artistic and cultural communities. He was
    particularly drawn to Cubist and Futurist styles, and in 1923, when he was
    introduced to lithography, he applied their principles to American subject
    matter.<br><br>Lozowick was among a small group of artists, including Jan
    Matulka and Howard Cook, who depicted the industrial city. Embracing these
    European movements while choosing specifically American subject matter was
    typical of Precisionism, and while artists like Charles Sheeler and Ralston
    Crawford never organized, they shared the approach of paring down their
    compositions to the simplest of forms. After the fall of the stock market
    and as the country turned towards despair in the 1930s, Lozowick adapted his
    concept of the city. Along with many artists, he turned toward depicting the
    social reality of its residents who were affected by the Depression.
    Throughout his career, New York remained his primary subject matter, and he
    reflected in 1943, "From the innumerable choices which our complex and
    tradition-laden civilization presents to the artist, I have chosen one which
    seems to suit my training and temperament. I might characterize it this:
    'Industry harnessed by Man for the Benefit of Mankind.'"<br><br>In the 1930s
    with the onset of the Great Depression, Lozowick turned toward depicting the
    social reality of New York City and its residents who were affected by
    economic despair. He also worked for public programs that supported artists,
    such as the New York Graphic Arts Division of the WPA and the Treasury
    Relief Art Project creating numerous prints and, most notably, in 1936, a
    mural for the New York City General Post Office.

    through exhibiting and teaching throughout his career. Between 1941 and
    1949, Pytlak is estimated to have created 96 screenprints, and during these
    years he had several solo exhibitions, including at the ACA Gallery, New

    began studying art in 1935 at age 20. During his time at New York City’s
    National Academy of Design, he studied under Leon Kroll. In 1937 he traveled
    to Europe, there discovering the works of Italian Renaissance painters Piero
    Della Francesca and Giotto. While in Europe Wolins also had the opportunity
    to see the Contemporary Paris Exhibition <i>Internationale des Arts et
    Techniques dans la Vie Moderne</I>. Among the modern works exhibited were
    Picasso’s <i>Guernica</i>, and Alexander Calder’s <i>Mercury Fountain</i>
    whose influence Wolins would carry with him throughout his career.
    <br><br>After returning home Joseph joined The Federal Art Project, a branch
    of the WPA (Works Progress Administration) which employed as many as 10,000
    artists at any given time. Typically known for the jarring images of life’s
    difficulty during The Great Depression (1929-1939) Wolins work revealed a
    more cubist/impressionistic approach very much motivated by his time in
    Europe. <br><br>In 1947 Wolins would have his first solo exhibition. He
    would go on to be featured at the 1964/65 New York World’s fair, The Whitney
    Museum, The Smithsonian and many others. Joseph Wolins, died in 1999, in New
    York City.

    Greene, and Albert Swinden to create murals for the community rooms of the

    these murals resurfaced during a renovation having been sealed behind false

    the New York Housing Authority, and on display at the Brooklyn Museum. This

    etching.  Sasowsky 90. <br><br>Born in Paris, the second son in a well-to-do
    family, Marsh attended Yale University and then moved to New York where,
    during the early 1920s, he worked as an illustrator and took classes at the
    Art Students League. Marsh was equally influenced by his art teachers in New
    York, notably John Sloan (1871-1951), as well as American Regionalists like
    Thomas Hart Benton (1889-1975) and Old Masters such as Rubens, Titian and
    Tintoretto. He wholly rejected the modern artistic movements gaining
    strength in America at the time-Cubism, Surrealism, Abstraction. Instead he
    pursued a style that is best summed up as social realism: depictions of
    everyday life in New York, Coney Island beach scenes, vaudeville and
    burlesque women, the jobless on the streets of New York and the railroad
    yards and freight trains in New York and New Jersey. <br><br>He participated
    in the federal art programs under the WPA, painting two murals in
    Washington, DC, and, funded by the Treasury Relief Art Project, completed a
    series of frescoes in the New York Customs House, now the National Museum of
    the American Indian, that depict eight New York Harbor scenes and eight
    portraits of great navigators. It is one of the most celebrated mural
    installations created under the New Deal in New York City.

    Signed in pencil, lower right. Published by Associated American Artists, New
    York. 1936.<br><br>A very good impression. Flint 141. <br><br>Lozowick was
    born in Ludvinovka, a small village near Kiev and moved to the larger city
    of Kiev with his brother as a child. He studied at the Kiev Art School
    before following his brother again to New York in 1906 where he settled in
    New Jersey, got a job at a factory, and learned English. He continued his
    studies, at the National Academy of Design, taking courses with Emil Carlsen
    and Leon Kroll. They pushed Lozowick to seek a personal viewpoint in his
    artwork beyond the traditional training. He took a break from making art
    while he was a student at Ohio State University and joined the army during
    World War I.<br><br>The modern European art movements had a profound effect
    on Lozowick, and between 1920 and 1924 he traveled to Europe and spent time
    meeting modern artists and enmeshing himself into artistic and cultural
    communities. He was particularly drawn to Cubist and Futurist styles, and in
    1923, when he was introduced to lithography, he applied their principles to
    American subject matter.<br><br>Lozowick was among a small group of artists,
    including Jan Matulka and Howard Cook, who depicted the industrial city.
    Embracing these European movements while choosing specifically American
    subject matter was typical of Precisionism, and while artists like Charles
    Sheeler and Ralston Crawford never organized, they shared the approach of
    paring down their compositions to the simplest of forms. After the fall of
    the stock market and as the country turned towards despair in the 1930s,
    Lozowick adapted his concept of the city. Along with many artists, he turned
    toward depicting the social reality of its residents who were affected by
    the Depression. Throughout his career, New York remained his primary subject
    matter, and he reflected in 1943, "From the innumerable choices which our
    complex and tradition-laden civilization presents to the artist, I have
    chosen one which seems to suit my training and temperament. I might
    characterize it this: 'Industry harnessed by Man for the Benefit of
    Mankind.'" Flint 75.<br><br>In the 1930s with the onset of the Great
    Depression, Lozowick turned toward depicting the social reality of New York
    City and its residents who were affected by economic despair. He also worked
    for public programs that supported artists, such as the New York Graphic
    Arts Division of the WPA and the Treasury Relief Art Project creating
    numerous prints and, most notably, in 1936, a mural for the New York City
    General Post Office.

    year, he contracted a life-threatening streptococcus infection that left him
    permanently disabled.  It is during this time that Landacre first took a
    drawing class.  In 1918 Landacre got a job as an illustrator and returned to
    school in 1923 at the Otis Art Institute, where he would encounter wood
    engraving for the first time.  During the Great Depression Landacre worked
    for the graphics department of the California WPA.

    first lithograph. Wood was urged to make lithographs by the New York art

    Three years later, Wood created<i> Tree Planting Group</i> and subsequently,
    in several years following, the remaining 18 lithographs which comprise his
    entire printed<i> oeuvre</i>.<br><br>Wood was one of the most well-known
    muralists of the WPA, having rose to celebrity status after his painting
    <i>American Gothic</i> won a bronze medal at the Art Institute of Chicago.
    Wood had always wished to re-create the midwest as an arts center and helped
    to found an artist colony in his native Cedar Rapids in 1932. In the Iowa
    University Parks Library in Ames, Iowa, Wood produced a series of murals in
    his archetypal American regionalist style (a first set for the Public Works
    of Art Project in 1934, a second in 1936 under the WPA). Wood also was also
    involved in the production of another Iowan mural project at the Callanan

    reads, "Along the dirt roads that run at various angles off the highways of
    central Missouri, there are hundreds of houses that look just like this one.
    The tenant farmers who occupy them, for longer or shorter times, always have
    little children who play around the houses while the grownups work the
    fields. Even when the women folk are in the kitchen, the children of these
    places look lonely, lonely like the places themselves. The little girl who
    works the pump is doing so 'just because.' For a moment there is nothing
    else to do." Fath 62.

    was a Philadelphia-based architect and artist born in Norfolk, Virginia. 
    During the Great Depression, he worked as an artist for the Public Works of
    Art Project and his lithographs were shown in the Division of Graphic Work's
    December-January 1933-34 exhibition at the National Gallery of Art,
    Washington, D.C. These lithographs were based on sketches White made during
    the summer of 1932 in remote West Virginia.  Later that summer, White worked
    on documenting the history of the Church of England and the parishes along
    the James River.  In addition to his research, he completed the series of
    lithographs, <i>Seven Old Churches in Virginia</i>.  Many of the artist's
    early prints feature architecture.  In the winter of 1932, White created
    seven portfolios entitled <i>Colonial Mansion in Fairmount Park</i>.  Later,
    White took on a more modernist style.

    a house painter, his father's profession.  In 1933, ten patrons led by
    Elizabeth Green in St. Louis formed a "Joe Jones Club" and financed his
    travel to the artists' colony in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where he
    furthered his artistic training.  In August 1935, Jones painted a mural
    series at the Commonwealth College at Mena, Arkansas.  He painted a New Deal
    mural for the post office in Charleston, Missouri, titled <i>Harvest</i> in
    1938.  This mural was done at the height of Jones' fame and is a classic
    subject for the artist.  It depicts the harvest of wheat in a very
    labor-intensive manner showing the cutting, gathering, and stacking of it
    onto a wagon.  Under a cloudy dark sky, wheat dominates the perspective with
    the farmers providing a great deal of motion.  Another New Deal mural
    entitled <i>Men and Wheat</i> was painted by Jones in 1940, followed by
    <i>Husking Corn</i> in 1941 for the Dexter, Missouri, post office, 
    <i>Turning a Corner</i> in 1939 in Anthony, Kansas and <i>Threshing in
    Magnolia</i>, Arkansas, in 1938.  All the murals depicted some process
    during a wheat harvest.

    1934.  Three years later, Wood created <i>Tree Planting Group</i> and
    subsequently, in several years following, the remaining 18 lithographs which
    comprise his entire printed <i>oeuvre</i>.<br><br>Wood was one of the most
    well-known muralists of the WPA, having rose to celebrity status after his
    painting <i>American Gothic</i> won a bronze medal at the Art Institute of
    Chicago.  Wood had always wished to re-create the midwest as an arts center
    and helped to found an artist colony in his native Cedar Rapids in 1932.  In
    the Iowa University Parks Library in Ames, Iowa, Wood produced a series of
    murals in his archetypal American regionalist style (a first set for the
    Public Works of Art Project in 1934, a second in 1936 under the WPA).  Wood
    also was also involved in the production of another Iowan mural project at
    the Callanan Middle School in Des Moines for the Federal Arts Project.

    strong contrasts.  Davenport 38.<br><br>Cadmus' works for the Works Progress
    Administration have frequently been envoked in the debate of censorship. 
    Cadmus' tempera on canvas <i>Fleets In!</i>, 1934 for the Public Works of
    Art Project depicted carousing U.S. sailors on shore leave.  <i>Aspects of
    Suburban Life</i>, 1936 was a series of studies for a Port Washington, Long
    Island post office mural commissioned by the Treasury Relief Art Project. 
    The project was never realized as it showed affluent Long Islanders in a
    negative light and insinuated an obvious and growing class divide.  Both
    Cadmus and Jared French (1905-1988) each received mural commissions for the
    lobby of the Parcel Post Building in Richmond, Virginia, completed in 1939. 
    Cadmus' mural <i>Pocahontas Saving the Life of John Smith</i> was retouched
    by the artist when it was noticed that one of the Powhatan men's breechcloth
    fox heads resembled a phallus.  The debate over public censorship continues
    when discussing Cadmus' legacy.  In a 1992 New York Times article, the
    artist's works were still criticized, "For its money, the W.P.A. got several
    subversive works from Cadmus . . ."

    intended edition of 100).  Signed, titled and inscribed "100 proofs" in
    pencil, lower margin.  From <i>New York City Life</i>.   1906.<br><br> A
    very good impression with strong contrasts.<br><br>In his diary, Sloan
    commented, "Back in 1906 there was a considerable French population north of
    23rd Street, and the church near Proctor's Theatre [141 West 23rd Street]
    was known as the French Church.  The stone steps down which these newlyweds
    are escaping have since been removed.  I hope the couple lived happy ever
    after."  Morse 138.<br><br>The WPA gave opportunities and financial help to
    many artists who were struggling during the Depression.  Sloan, already an
    established artist and teacher at the Art Students League (who taught many
    artists who particapted in the WPA programs), did not fit that profile, but
    he did participate in the Treasury Section of Fine Arts, which hired
    well-known artists for its projects.  He painted the mural <i>The Arrival of
    the First Mail in Bronxville in 1846</i> for the post office in Bronxville,
    New York.  He also created two paintings for the WPA, one <i>The Wigwam, Old
    Tammany Hall</i>, now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
    New York, the other <i>Fourteenth Street at Sixth Avenue</i>, originally
    hung the office of U.S. Senator Royal Copeland and now is exhibited at the
    Detroit Insitute of Arts.

    Signed in pencil, lower right.  Published by Associated American Artists,
    New York.  1938.<br><br>A very good impression.  Cole 4.<br><br>Wood was one
    of the most well-known muralists of the WPA, having rose to celebrity status
    after his painting <i>American Gothic</i> won a bronze medal at the Art
    Institute of Chicago.  Wood had always wished to re-create the midwest as an
    arts center and helped to found an artist colony in his native Cedar Rapids
    in 1932.  In the Iowa University Parks Library in Ames, Iowa, Wood produced
    a series of murals in his archetypal American regionalist style (a first set
    for the Public Works of Art Project in 1934, a second in 1936 under the
    WPA).  Wood also was involved in the production of another Iowan mural
    project at the Callanan Middle School in Des Moines for the Federal Arts
    Project.

    <br><br>Atherton was a graphic designer and a surrealist painter. While he

    remembered for this poster he designed for the New York World's Fair. He
    also designed at least two World War II posters. <br><br>World of Tomorrow

  TYPESET: >-
    <br>Poster calendar, with 12 calendar sheets attached at bottom. 692x394 mm,
    27¼x15½ inches. <br><br>A United Airlines Douglas DC-3 "Mainliner" makes its
    way across a truncated map of the United States. The plane is flying from
    the Golden Gate Bridge and the towers of Treasure Island at the San
    Francisco World's Fair to the New York World's Fair Trylon and Perisphere on
    the opposite side of the country. Radebaugh's love of the airbrush began
    with his studies at the Art Institute of Chicago. Although virtually unknown
    in the poster community, he became a prolific illustrator for magazines
    including <i>Esquire, Fortune,</i> and <i>Motor</i> and produced
    advertisements for Coca-Cola and United Airlines as well as the auto
    industry. His trademark style was the ultimate in "luminous Art Deco . . . a
    sense of industrial design that was both pragmatic and prescient; he took
    what was cutting edge . . . and made them more elegant, functional and
    fantastical to behold" (http://arthur-radebaugh.blogspot.com/). This image
    also appeared as a regular poster (See Swann Sale 2589 Lot 232).
