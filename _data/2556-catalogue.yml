This image is the first listed. The mailing envelope and a brief Easter greeting are also included.

    Hurd and Brown collaborated on two of the most enduring and beloved children's books of all time: _Goodnight Moon_ and _The Runaway Bunny_. The famous tale of a verbal hide-and-seek game which describes a mother's enduring love for her curious little bunny was first published in 1942, has never been out of print, and sold millions of copies worldwide. In 1972, Hurd republished the iconic work with revised illustrations that kept the spirit of the original and was embraced by a new generation of readers.

    As far as we are able to determine, no original illustration for either edition of _The Runaway Bunny_ has come to auction previously. Hurd's papers and most of the original studies for this and other works are housed in the Clement Hurd archive at University of Minnesota Libraries Children's Literature Research Collections.

  LOW: "800"

  TYPESET: |-
    Graphite and crayon, measuring 115x65 mm; 4½x2½ inches. The letter is 1 page, 8vo, dated January 22, 1976, on Keats' stationery: "Your mother wrote me a very interesting letter about your visit to New York City. I hope you had lots of fun during your visit, but I'm sorry that you didn't meet Peter. Here is a drawing I did especially for you of Peter, and I hope you like it. He likes you. I'm also sending you some material you may find of interest, and a press sheet of THE SNOWY DAY. A press sheet is what a book looks like when it comes off the printing presses, before it is cut up and bound into a book. With all good wishes to you and your family, your friend, Ezra Jack Keats." The press sheet (for his book _Louie_) and some related promotional material by Macmillan accompanies the letter.

    Keats won the Caldecott Medal in 1963 for _The Snowy Day_, the groundbreaking classic that is credited for introducing multiculturalism to mainstream children's literature and the first picture book with an African American protagonist to win a major children’s award.

    For Keats, who grew up in a tenement in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn in the 1920s, drawing was his salvation and the means for his acceptance by others. After illustrating other writers' works for several years, he set out to create his own stories in an urban setting. _The Snowy Day's_ Peter would be a black child in his own voice and not "a white kid colored brown...\[and\] not through the benevolence of white children or anyone else."

    Despite criticism about its "tokenism" and its being written by a white Jewish man who falsely represented (or ignored) African-American culture, the book overcame these accusations and was embraced by generations of young readers who could identify with a boy whose skin color resembled theirs and, more universally, of an adventure every child could relate to. In addition to its hero, the book was also groundbreaking in its use of mixed media illustration techniques of collaged decorative papers, fabric, stamps, and cloth; a method Keats would employ in future books.

    \n\nWilliam’s Doll was one of the first children’s books to address nontraditional
    gender stereotypes and is commonly utilized by teachers in the classroom for lessons
    against intolerance and to introduce students to the concept of sex-stereotyping.
    The story follows a young boy who desperately desires a doll to care for, much
    to the chagrin of his father who insists on providing toys he deems more gender-appropriate,
    such as basketballs and train sets. While William enjoys these toys, he continues
    to wish for a doll, and endures the bullying of his brother and the neighborhood
    children who call him “creepy” and label him a “sissy.” Eventually, William’s
    understanding grandmother buys him a doll with curly eyelashes, a long white dress,
    and a bonnet. When William’s father objects, she explains, “He needs it…to hug
    and to cradle and to take to the park so that when he’s a father like you, he’ll
    know how to take care of his baby…” (pages 31-32). \n\nPène du Bois' whimsical
    illustrations and beloved cast of characters made serious themes accessible and
    engaging for children. The American author and illustrator is among a select few

    Beardsley's tour-de-force was his first major commission and one in which he explored techniques suited to fine book reproduction, specifically the line-block. The artist's knowledge of the text and the literary associations with flora guided his choice for their usage in specific sections of the story. The clematis here indicates artifice and mental beauty. Zatlin, Linda, Aubrey Beardsley: A Catalogue Raisonné, Vol 1; #456.

    Dohanos is best known for the cover images that he produced for The Saturday Evening Post, creating 123 of them during the 1940s and 1950s. It was during this period that he became a household name. According to his family, he was extremely methodical when bringing a cover from concept to final draft; Dohanos sketched his ideas, researched his subjects, and skillfully utilized models to translate his visions of everyday American life into compelling works of art. This study shows his creative process.

    The magazine describes the cover as follows: "The poets sing of spring as a great awakening, and for the flowers, the trees and the birds - who have been resting up all winter down South - it may be. But when spring waves her magic wand over mankind, the effect is about the same as if she had used a blackjack, and the gentle spring zephyrs operate as if they contained a light general anesthetic. As the sap rises, ambition sags, and as the birds rejoice, men and women greet the annual revival with a heartfelt yawn. Exemplifying this seasonal languor in Stevan Dohanos' cover painting is Sgt. William McDonough, of the Bridgeport, Connecticut, Police Department, a hard-working man when not posing for a spring-fever picture. He runs the department's sign shop."

    of greed and betrayal, written by Charles Perrault, the 17th century master of
    the fairy and folk tale genre. The story opens with the newly married Fatima living
    in the grand palace of her husband, Bluebeard, who allows her every domestic pleasure
    with one condition: she is never to open a particular locked closet. One day,
    however, Fatima''s curiosity gets the best of her. She grabs the key the moment
    he''s away and discovers the gruesome hidden secret behind the mysterious door:
    a room full of the murdered corpses of his former inquisitive wives. Terrified,
    she shuts the door and remains silent about her transgression, but when the enraged
    Blue Beard discovers the bloodied key to the door, he vows to add her to his collection
    for lying to him. In this painting, Dulac masterfully captured the dramatic moment
    when Fatima''s brothers come to her rescue and attack her vengeful husband just
    before he is about to behead her. His composition sets the viewer at the corner
    of the tower room, offering us Fatima''s perspective, rather than a close-up frontal

Kent created many such drawings of Rocky, along with numerous images of local scenery, and a now famous series of large-scale landscapes in oil during their father-son sojourn to Fox Island, Alaska during 1918-19. There the young artist rented a small cabin on a fox and goat farm to live in solitude and to recover from his troubled marriage and a world at war. In 1920, upon his return, Marie Sterner of Knoedler & Co. Gallery, New York, arranged a show of the Alaska drawings, including this work. There, publishing giant George Palmer Putnam was so impressed that he urged Kent to combine them with his letters and diary entries to create an illustrated narrative of his trip which Putnam published later that year as Wilderness: A Journal of Quiet Adventure in Alaska. The book was published just after the opening of a highly successful second Knoedler show featuring the Alaska paintings. The popularity of the two launched Kent's career and secured a long and successful relationship with Putnam who, on the heels of this first venture, helped him become the first "incorporated artist." The pencil sketch for this drawing is in the Houghton Library collection at Harvard.

    Parrish's early decorative design work is evident in this mannerist drawing of a minute hand, with a whimsical dolphin whose elongated tail extends into an arrow. The style is similar to those he would later use in The Knave of Hearts by Louise Saunders (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1925.) In a letter by Alma Gilbert, Parrish scholar and Director of the Cornish Colony Gallery & Museum (the Cornish Colony was the New Hampshire artists' colony to which Parrish belonged), to the owner of this work, she writes that he used these designs as the basis for his own utilitarian water gauge which he placed outside his studio work room to let him know at a glance if the water level to the main house reservoir was low, whereupon he would turn a pump switch in the studio to refill it without having to leave.

    Portrait published in The Saturday Review of Literature, February 6, 1932. Pen and ink on paper. Signed "G. P. du Bois" in lower right image, and dated \[19\]32. Archivally matted and framed with gallery and exhibition labels on verso of backing board. Not removed from frame for inspection.

    Pène du Bois’ portrait of Lytton Strachey, the British writer and critic, was published shortly after Strachey’s death, which occurred on January 21, 1932. Pène du Bois depicts the author in his characteristic beard and horn-rimmed glasses while seated and absorbed in his own thoughts. A founding member of the Bloomsbury Group and author of Eminent Victorians (1918), Strachey is known for his biographies that combined psychological insight with witty irreverence. Pène du Bois’ inclusion of a rough portrait of Queen Victoria hanging on the wall is a subtle nod to Strachey’s 1921 biography of the Queen, which was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.

    Pène du Bois began contributing illustrations of literary figures for _The Saturday Review of Literature_ upon his return to the United States in 1930 after spending four years in France.

    du Bois caricatures the angular features of T.S. Eliot and includes references
    to his prolific poetry through the spines of books stacked nearby. While in life
    Eliot typically wore his hair slicked back, Pène du Bois gives him curls and depicts
    him daintily holding a spoon, a clever reference to Eliot’s first professionally
    published poem from 1915, “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” which contains
    the line “I have measured out my life with coffee spoons.” Pène du Bois’ portrait
    was likely completed in 1932, around the time Eliot returned from London to the
    United States in order to become a professor at Harvard, where he once studied."

Based on the scene depicted and the name "Ellenita" on the lifeboat's hull, it is most certainly for the true but often hyperbolically retold story about the notorious Captain William Henry "Bully" Hayes and the Pacific ship he fraudulently seized in 1859.As the tale goes, the wily Hayes smuggled goods onto the Ellenita, a Tahiti-bound vessel at a port of call in Maui. Aware of the suspicions of the local Sheriff Treadway, Hayes invited him aboard the ship to satisfy himself that no contraband existed. He then proceeded to ply him with liquor, weighed anchor, and sailed out far enough before forcing the drunken Treadway into the lifeboat to row himself back to shore. The sheriff was the lucky one in the end as the Ellenita sank off the shores of the Navigator Islands, though the unstoppable Hayes survived to terrorize the seas again.

As the story goes, Arturo Toscanini was fiercely protective of his studio sessions and rehearsals. Fredenthal, a friend of one of the recording technicians at RCA, snuck in and was allowed to observe the rehearsals from the booth. Over the course of six weeks, he was able to produce a dynamic series of drawings of the notoriously private conductor totally unguarded and engrossed in his craft -- that is, until Toscanini spotted Fredenthal and had him summarily removed. With Toscanini at his peak fame, Vogue published several of Fredenthal's drawings, August 1, 1949 "Toscanini: Six rehearsal sketches of the Maestro."

The special was nominated for five Emmys, including "Individual Achievements in Art Direction and Allied Crafts - Art Direction," for which Tom H. John was the nominee. The 60-minute program was split into three acts and was filmed in color, a novelty for television at the time. The lot includes designs from the opening museum segment (2 sheets), circus segment (4 artworks and 1 photograph), and the concert segment (1 sheet).The crew filmed the opening act at The Philadelphia Museum of Art (they originally intended to film at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, but were denied permission). Two of the three brand new Marconi color cameras gave out as soon as filming began, which left only one camera for the entire opening section. Streisand spoke about taping at the museum in March 1966: "It's not easy to do a musical show in a museum but I got a kick out of asking them to move a million dollars worth of paintings simply to provide an appropriate backdrop for a song. It was fun, but it took so much time [that] technicians were falling asleep at the cameras.”The second circus segment was filmed with live animals. Streisand recalled: “Chaos threatened again. The lights were hell on the penguins, a lion broke out of its cage, and a baby elephant roared so loud that a nearby llama nearly suffered a heart attack.” Tom H. John worked as a production designer for more than 200 major productions, including numerous Broadway stage plays and musicals, major motion pictures, and television series and specials. Over the course of his career, John has received 5 Emmy Awards and the prestigious Peabody Award. He currently works as a fine artist in New York City.

Chast" in lower portion of egg.In 2003, Roz Chast began experimenting with an unconventional approach to pysanky, a Ukrainian folk art form of colorful and intricately decorated eggshells that is said to date from pagan times. Foregoing conventional vegetal and geometric motifs, Chast adorns her eggs with the types of "Grade A" witticisms and neuroses typically found in her cartoons for The New Yorker.Chast utilizes specialty tools to create her eggs: a Blas-fix is used to bore a hole in the egg and pump out the insides; a kistka, a drawing implement that dispenses melted beeswax; jars full of colored dye; and a candle with which to heat the wax in the kistka and, later, to burn it off the shell. Rather than plugging the egg's drainage hole with wax, Chast leaves it open. In an interview with Carol Kino for The New York Times on November 26, 2004, Chast explained her reasoning: "I have this paranoia that if I totally seal up the egg, and there's a little tiny bit of egg business inside, it's going to rot and build up horrible gases and then the egg will explode. Better be safe than sorry."

Ink with occasional watercolor on stiff paper. 431x356 mm; 17x14 inches, plus two lithographs printed in pink, black, and white, created from drawings of the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy, measuring slightly smaller. All signed by Lee. In addition to the Marx Brothers and a different rendering of Laurel and Hardy than the litho, the original drawings include: Abbott and Costello, Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, George Burns and Gracie Allen, Charlie Chaplin, Imogene Coca and Sid Caesar, Buster Keaton, Jerry Lewis, Moms Mabley, Mae West, among others.The illustrations were apparently commissioned for a Manhattan location of the Comedy Hall of Fame which was never realized, but was instead built on Long Island in Jericho, New York. The thriving center operates as a conservancy and production company, dedicated to preserving comedy as a performing art and through extensive programming, classes, and educational outreach.

    JO FISCHER (1900-1987)
    "From 9 to 5." Together, group of 8 original "From 9 to 5" single-panel daily comics, published 1947-50, and 1954, most with Sun and Times Co. pastedowns. Pen, ink and Zip-A-Tone over graphite with correction fluid on stiff paper. Most about 200x155 mm; 7¾x6 inches, on 10x9-inch sheets. Most signed "Jo Fischer" and dated within image area, with typed captions pasted in lower margins. Taped to mattes and individually framed. “From 9 to 5” follows the gossip and daily interactions between the office administrators, Hysteria, Deleria, Angora, and Coma, and their exasperated boss, Mr. Wump. The women are fashionably outfitted in the latest styles, with calf-length pencil skirts, tight tops, ankle-twisting high heels, and long eyelashes. The comic ran for more than 30 years, and at its peak, was printed in 100 newspapers nationwide. Regular readers often contributed gag ideas, and if Fischer used a suggestion, he recognized the fan by incorporating his or her name and location in the comic through signs hung on the sides of desks.

  TYPESET: |-
    ARTHUR B. FROST (1851-1928)
    "Nature Study With a Camera" Together, 21 drawings for a 20-panel cartoon published in The Ladies' Home Journal, August 1915. Three of the included panels were replaced with a different composition in the final publication. Pen and ink on stiff paper. Image sizes vary, each on an approximately 185x245 mm; 7½x9½-inch sheet. Final page signed "A. B. Frost." Not dated. Loose sheets organized into 3-ring binder with sheet protectors. A 24-panel concept study sheet in graphite accompanies the lot. The full published caption reads "Nature Study With a Camera: William Tries to Photograph a Lamb and Finds its Action so Contagious That He Becomes Quite Lamblike."Frost, an already well-established illustrator, enrolled in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1878 to study under Thomas Eakins. At the time, Eakins was fascinated with technical advances in photography, particularly the innovative motion studies of Eadweard Muybridge. Theirry Smolderen argues that Muybridge’s study of movement in animals and humans, and its visual output of repetitive chronophotographic compositions, was influential for Frost’s picture stories. He states: “In a certain way his comics engaged, within the realm of cartoons, a discussion that paralleled that which was unfolding in the world of art.” (Smolderen, 120).Frost was one of the first cartoonists to develop a style based on the expressive potential of the photographic process.This charming picture story of a photographer and a lamb illustrates how Frost playfully engaged with the idiom of progressive action. Frost evokes Muybridge’s repetitive grid to move beyond the temporal and spatial aspects of motion to evoke what Smolderen calls the “inner, elastic metric of surging emotion.” (Smolderen, 126). Here, Frost’s initially wary photographer absorbs the spontaneous energy and hapless exuberance of the rambunctious lamb he attempts to photograph. The 24-panel concept study sheet and the revisions to panels included in the published version show Frost’s artistic process and the possible guidance of an editor, who may have suggested that the visual narrative could be conveyed through fewer panels. See the chapter “A. B. Frost and the Photographic Revolution,” published in The Origins of Comics: From William Hogarth to Winsor McCay by Theirry Smolderen (Jackson: University of Mississippi, 2014, pages 119-136, reproduced page 118).

    "Find me my boys or else ---!" Original "Katzenjammer Kids" Sunday comic, published October 13, 1935. Pen and ink on stiff paper. 415x521 mm; 16¼x20½ inches, on 18x23-inch sheet. Signed "Knerr" and dated "'35" in last panel, "10-13" in seventh panel, and ink stamped with full date in left margin. Rudolph Dirks was commissioned by William Randolph Hearst to develop The Katzenjammer Kids, which starred Hans and Fritz, naughty protagonists who rebelled against the authority of "Mama" and "der Captain." After fifteen years of success, Dirks wanted to take a temporary year-long hiatus, which was denied by the syndicate. When he left without permission, Harold Knerr took over the strip. Dirks sued, but despite a long legal battle, Hearst was allowed to continue the strip's publication under Knerr's direction. However, Dirks was permitted to create a nearly identical strip for the rival Pulitzer paper in 1914, which he initially titled Hans and Fritz, but later renamed The Captain and the Kids due to rising anti-German sentiment during World War I. With similar plotlines and characters, the two comics soon achieved near equal popularity.

Much like Clemens, Pryor's acerbic and uncompromising wit both outraged and delighted his contemporaries. Lawrence J. Wilker, the President of Kennedy Center at the time, said that Pryor encouraged Americans to confront the "large social questions of race and the more tragicomic aspects of the human condition . . . They were both (Pryor and Clemens) trenchant social critics who spoke the truth, however outrageous."

    New York Mets. Cartoon possibly published in Look magazine, circa 1970s. Airbrush on board. 154x117 mm; 6x4½ inches, on 10x8-inch board. Initialed "RG" in lower left image. Best known for creating the iconic poser for the 1980 film Airplane!, Grossman was a prolific illustrator and caricaturist who contributed to leading publications, including Rolling Stone, The New York Times, New York magazine, Esquire, National Lampoon, and Sports Illustrated. He received an Academy Award nomination in 1977 for his animated short Jimmy the C. This charming cartoon shows Grossman's adept skill for airbrush, a medium that he first encountered as a child at his father's silk-screen printing shop, and eventually mastered. Graphic design scholar, Steven Heller, praised the distinctive aesthetic the illustrator achieved: “Grossman kind of redefined the genre of caricature by introducing the airbrush as a tool. He gave it a kind of sculptural but at the same time comic form. He gave it shades and gradients that the others didn’t do. And at the same time he also captured likenesses with brilliant precision and great wit.”

Attached to original stretcher and framed to 33x27 inches. Some areas of restoration. A tear sheet of the printed magazine cover accompanies the artwork. Provenance: American Illustrators Gallery, January 1992; thence to Dick McDonough.Kernan's iconic image of interwar college football.Joseph Francis Kernan was a master of nostalgic and humorous illustrations of middle-class America. His work graced the covers and pages of nearly every major magazine, as well as advertisements and calendars produced between the 1920s and 1940s. An outdoorsman and athlete who played professional baseball to help finance his art education and early career in commercial art, Kernan often incorporated sporting themes into his work with a keen sensitivity. He described his desire to capture “the human side of outdoor sports, hunting, fishing and dogs.”This cover, one of twenty-six he would create for The Saturday Evening Post, became so popular that it was reproduced numerous times. Compared with this finished painting, the published cover silhouettes the players to allow for the magazine's graphic device of partially hiding the title to give the illustration a three-dimensional effect. It shows Kernan's signature farther to the left than he signed this canvas, which also contains full background imagery of a bright blue sky with clouds, a grassy playing field, and the hint of a cheering crowd in the far background.Many have noted the similarity between this image and the Heisman trophy, awarded annually to the most outstanding player in college football since 1934. It was likely the inspiration for Frank Eliscu, the sculptor who created that trophy two years later. Having appeared on the cover of a magazine with a circulation of over a million, he, like most Americans, would have been familiar with this image. In the cover and the trophy, the football is cradled in the player's left arm while he looks out towards his extended right arm and outstretched hand.

Nicely framed with title plate.Provenance: Sotheby's, London, September 30, 2009, lot 25; Bonhams California, November 12, 2018, lot 227; thence to Dick McDonough. People have been playing golf amongst the "bents, sandhills and windlestrae" at Leven Links in Scotland, since 1846, making it one of the oldest courses in the world. The unique terrain, with its natural slopes, valleys, and parallel dune ridges, provides the ideal setting for links golf. An Editor of Golf Monthly once described the older parts of Leven Links as “being one of the best stands of bents and fescues in Scotland – the place in summer to put away the solid ball, leave the wedge in the locker room and hone your chip and run approaches because this is where the real game is played." The course was originally designed with 9 holes and was extended to 18 holes eastward over the Mile Dyke toward the sandhills of Lundin Links in 1868. Players and their families maintained the course themselves until a green keeper was employed in 1876.Here, Michael Brown depicts a player preparing to take a difficult shot from a fairway bunker while a caddy and fellow players look on. Brown, a keen golfer and founding member of Mortonhall Golf Club in Edinburgh, was acquainted with fellow member, Dr. J. Turnbull Smith, who was the manager of the Life Association of Scotland. Brown produced annual golf-themed advertising calendars for the organization from 1895 to 1916. His paintings captured important tournaments of the day and famous political golfing personalities.

The way Christy drew her, she was popular with the males because of her charm, while the young women liked her because she embodied their dreams of emancipation."

In my own case, that specialty is painting golf subjects. I have been intimately associated with golf since I was a caddie at the age of twelve and have since won five club championships."

Gustavson, NY, 1967.Provenance: PGA REACH, The Golf Auction, November 2019, lot 283; thence to Dick McDonough. PGA REACH is the charitable foundation of the PGA of America. Saint Andrews Golf Club, founded in 1888 and originally located in Yonkers, New York, is often considered the home of golf in America. In 1892, it consisted of six holes surrounded by apple trees. There was one large apple tree, described at the time as, “The Old Apple Tree where the gang hung their coats, lunch basket and demijohns.” It was also referred to as “the first 19th hole.” Gustavson captures the spirit of that time in this iconic illustration. Gustavson was an excellent golfer himself and illustrated the book How To Play Your Best Golf by Tommy Armour in 1954. He explained that, "eventually, either by choice, economic pressure, or convenient timing, many artists concentrate on a particular subject which they know a great deal about and are able to interpret with precision and meaning. In my own case, that specialty is painting golf subjects. I have been intimately associated with golf since I was a caddie at the age of twelve and have since won five club championships." Gustavson also authored and illustrated the instructional book Enjoy Your Golf: An Illustrated Guide to Better Golf (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1954).

Clothing for sport was no exception and handsome, well-dressed men and women enjoying the game or posing with its paraphernalia were a major theme in his work. In this detailed study, a good example of his working style, we see the cool, laid-back player stopping to light a cigarette with inset studies of his clothing and hand positioning as he strikes the match. The vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines that Leyendecker employed to help him with his composition and proportionality can be traced back to his formal art training and are often found in such studies.

Though he dedicated the book “to the Scoffers, the Duffers, and the Golfer,” he speaks of his fondness for the “duffer” in his introduction: “I prefer the thoughts of a duffer, because I believe in my cartoons of him I can reach the majority who make up the golf world. I do not have to exaggerate, I do not have to imagine. One need only to observe and draw only the real happenings, repeat the actual sayings, and depict true expressions.”Though he claimed to be a “duffer,” Briggs was an avid golfer and often played at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, the first public course in the United States. He was also a founding member of the Wykagyl Country Club in Westchester County, New York.

One need only to observe and draw only the real happenings, repeat the actual sayings, and depict true expressions.” Though he claimed to be a “duffer,” Briggs was an avid golfer and often played at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, the first public course in the United States. He was also a founding member of the Wykagyl Country Club in Westchester County, New York.

In his introduction to the text, Tillinghast states: “Somewhere, nestled among the hills of Everywhere, is Homesburg, and there, too, is the golf course of Cobble Valley. The Links differ from others, just as they all do, but, after all, the people there are very like those of every other section. In the stories contained in this volume the author has attempted an analysis of human nature.”Tillinghast is considered one of the foremost figures in golf architecture, his course designs are among the best in the world. He designed more than 260 of them throughout his career and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2015, becoming the sixth architect to be recognized in the Lifetime Achievement category.Not only an accomplished designer, "Tilly" was a prolific golf writer, penning a syndicated newspaper column and contributing regularly to magazines including The American Golfer, Golf Illustrated, The Professional Golfer of America, among others. His humorous Cobble Valley Golf Yarns and Other Sketches was followed with a sequel in 1925 entitled The Mutt...And Other Golf Yarns. In the mid-1930s, he worked for the PGA of America, traveling the country to advise member facilities on course changes and maintenance. He also produced several volumes of collected articles and essays.

Each sheet measures 438x241 mm; 17¼x9½ inches, with two hanging holes at top as printed. Condition varies (see report). Provenance: Private collection; thence to Dick McDonough, October 2019.Edward Penfield, among the most famous and prolific graphic artists of all time, is credited for initiating the American phase of the international phenomenon known as the "poster craze," the burst of creative commercial activity in the 1890s. During this period in Penfield's career, he was working as Art Editor at Harper's, where he produced many of his most famous posters and illustrated books, but was also quite active as a freelancer. Among those projects were a number of themed poster calendars, produced largely by R.H. Russell Publishers. "The posters created for the Golf Calendar 1900 are among the most beautifully colored images conceived by Penfield, with clear, flat shapes and striking compositions"--David Gibson, Designed to Persuade: The Graphic Art of Edward Penfield published by, and in conjunction with, the exhibition at The Hudson River Museum, Yonkers, May 20-July 15, 1984.The Golf Calendars were produced for 1899 and 1900. A comparison of images between them shows that they are nearly identical except for the cover and the illustration for February. Either is extremely uncommon, especially complete, and this is the only example of the 1900 calendar we could find appearing on the auction market in a search covering two decades.
