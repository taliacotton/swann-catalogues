    book look" where the use of minimal imagery and large point, bold lettering
    allowed the book to stand out on the shelves. Such famous titles include
    Joseph Heller’s Catch-22, Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five, One Flew Over
    the Cuckoo’s Nest, the original hardback cover for Jaws, and Phillip Roth’s
    Portnoy’s Complaint. He also worked on projects for the legendary Blue Note
    jazz label, designing covers for Thelonious Monk, Wes Montgomery, Dizzy
    Gillespie, and Chet Baker. By the end of his long career, he had created a
    staggering six and a half thousand book covers and over two hundred album
    covers.

    <br><br>Provenance: Private collection, Los Angeles, California.<br><br>John
    Blackburn was born in Statesboro, Georgia in 1939. He attended art school in
    Nashville, Tennessee. After graduation, he settled in Atlanta but relocated
    to Los Angeles in the 1960s where his career flourished. There he drew
    illustrations for such publications as <i>Physique Pictorial, Physique Art
    Quarterly, One, In Touch, FirstHand, ManTalk, Manscape,</i> and <i>Guys</i>
    magazines. During the late 70's, Blackburn created the character of Coley
    Cochran, a 19-year-old bisexual who is kidnapped and undergoes a rite which
    turns him into a Dorian Gray-like ageless "voodoo sex god," narcissistic and
    able to seduce anyone. The artist incorporated his own experiences and
    memories of being a young gay man in the south during the '60s and '70s into
    Coley's character and narrative. He self-published four volumes of the
    popular series between 1989-1991.

  DESCRIPT: BRALDT BRALDS (1951-)
  CROSSHEAD: Karl Marx. V for Victory.
  TYPESET: >-
    Illustration for the cover of Der Spiegel, issue #34, August 8, 2005. Oil on
    wood panel. 348x270 mm; 13¾x10½ inches. Signed and dated "© Braldt Bralds.
    `05" in lower right. Archivally float-mounted and framed to 25¼x21¾ inches.
    <br><br>Born in 1848, Karl Marx is considered the "Father of Communism." A
    scholarly political theorist and philosopher, he lived in times of social
    upheaval which he came to see as a severely unbalanced system between the
    privileged and working classes, a struggle that had been going on since
    early civilization. Marx believed that capitalism merely replaced feudalism;
    he foresaw an inevitable rise of corporate monopolies in that system, which
    he believed would eventually destroy the lives of all but those at very the
    top. "Though his writings urged populations to unite and strive for a
    classless civilization, things didn’t work out idyllically in the communist
    governments that arose; they weren’t immune to megalomaniacs either, and
    created a few of note. Communism, along with its idealistic founders, were
    vilified."-- Bralds,<i>The Way I Saw Things: The Art of Braldt Bralds.</i>
    However, by the turn of the 21st Century, Marx’s points were being
    reconsidered. In August 2005 <i>Der Spiegel</i> ran its cover story about
    this ("Ein Gespenst Kehrt Zurück; Die neue Macht der Linken"), commissioning
    Bralds to illustrate it. His keen portrait shows a vindicated Marx giving
    the "V for Victory" hand sign as his reputation receives a little cleaning.

    Offset Press, 1951. Tipped to window matte. <br><br>Provenance: Private
    collection, Connecticut. <br><br>Cleland's practice was to re-draw his work
    directly onto the lithographic plates from tracing paper, which would then
    be printed onto a sheet-fed Harris offset press. Though a painstaking task,
    he felt it necessary to achieve the accuracy he desired. His early mentor
    was D. B. Updike of Merrymount Press, who provided both commissions and
    criticism, leaving Cleland chronically unsatisfied with anything less than
    perfection. Comparing the pencil drawing to the four-color lithograph, one
    can see subtle differences in the shading, linework, and composition, but
    the result is extraordinary.

    Illustration to accompany Cushing's poem of the same name, published in

    mounted to upper right corner of verso.<br><br>Though an accomplished
    illustrator, cartoonist, and poster artist who studied and taught in the
    U.S. and abroad, there exists little biographical coverage of Cushing, much
    as a result of his heirs destroying evidence of his sexuality. Most prolific
    at the turn of the century when commercial illustration hit its stride in
    magazines and newspapers, he was influenced by his contemporaries J.C.
    Leyendecker, Aubrey Beardsley and his admittedly favorite illustrator, Lord
    Frederic Leighton. Art historians have remarked that across his body of
    work, a clear homoeroticism can be detected in the proportions and the
    haughty attitude of his young male subjects, evidenced here by the dance's
    onlookers.

    Original illustration for the lithograph produced for the 1889 World's Fair
    in Paris (May 5-October 31, 1889) by French printer and bookseller Jean Noël
    Monrocq. Watercolor and gouache on paper mounted to thicker paper stock.

    <br><br>Provenance: the artist, gifted to friends, Private collection,
    Paris, descended through family acquainted with the artist.
    <br><br>Published: cover of Musée d'Orsay exhibition catalogue "1889: La
    Tour Eiffel et l'Exposition Universelle," Paris, 1989 (from the lithograph
    in their holdings). <br><br>Exhibited: Salon des Artistes Français,
    1885-1906. <br><br>Garen's bold, colorful image of the Eiffel Tower, the
    centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, and its grand pavillions, alighting
    the night sky above the twinkling Seine beautifully portrayed the wonders of
    the world-famous spectacle. It was chosen as one of the representative
    images of the Exposition and this original painting was made into a
    mass-produced lithograph on one of the latest printing technologies. This
    method would be demonstrated live at the show's Gallery of Machines.
    <br><br>This new press, created by the famed machinist Hippolyte Auguste
    Marioni was named "La Diligente." Developed by Jules Michaud (Marioni's
    son-in-law), it was a cylinder lithographic zinc matrix press for color
    printing and the forerunner of rotocalcography (offset lithography). To
    reproduce the painting, it was divided into 6 parts of roughly equal size to
    to meet the technical requirements needed to make the matrix. Enhancements
    were then applied to the final graphic for visual clarity and impact. Once
    completed, the painting was reassembled and restored, its cut lines masked
    with gouache (visible here, but well camouflaged). <br><br>The lithograph
    was immediately disseminated throughout Europe, enticing visitors to the
    Exposition and establishing Garen's image as its iconic face. This
    information was provided with the help of Eric Le Ray, author, <I>Marioni,

    l'Harmattan, 2009) and Pierre-Antoine Lebel, Musée de l'Imprerie et de la

    Created for De Beers' "A Diamond is Forever" ad campaign, 1971. Acrylic on
    canvas. 914x711 mm; 36x28 inches.<br><br>Hane was a highly talented and
    prolific illustrator during the short span of his professional career.
    Though he created hundreds of magazine, book, and album cover designs, he is
    likely best known for the covers of the Collier-Macmillan editions of C.S.
    Lewis's <i>Chronicles of Narnia</i> books and the surrealist covers for
    Carlos Castaneda's <i>The Teachings of Don Juan</i> and <i>A Separate
    Reality</i> for Simon & Schuster. <br><br>Created for De Beers' ubiquitous
    "A Diamond is Forever" campaign -and the company's slogan - the painting is
    a gorgeous example of his work, generally scarce on the market. It is
    rendered in a rich palette, with moody figures and backgrounds to create a
    sense of mystique. The full text, with its very 1970s astrology vibe, read:
    "A love by the stars was important. Until the right man of the wrong sign
    put his star on my finger. And I entered his house with my love." <br>Hane
    was at the height of his creative powers when he died as a result of a
    mugging in Central Park, but was recognized by the artistic community with
    several posthumous awards. Philadelphia College of Art, in his home state of
    Pennsylvania, offers an annual Roger T. Hane Memorial Award to the student
    with the year's best illustration portfolio.

  CROSSHEAD: '"''Shoeless'' Joe Jackson."'
  TYPESET: >-
    India ink on paper, 1987. 763x560 mm; 30x22 inches. Signed and captioned on
    verso with artist's fish stamp. Mounted to backing board and framed to 33x24
    inches. <br><br>Realistic portraits of baseball players and game scenes are
    Richbourg's primary subject matter. He was inspired by his father, Lance
    Sr., who was signed in 1919 by John McGraw of the N.Y. Giants and played
    professional baseball until 1938.  "I would debate anyone that baseball is
    far superior to any other sport in terms of its beauty, the range of skills
    required to play, and its clarity and subversion of time.  As an artist, I
    have been satisfied with the possibilities of depicting the light and space
    of the playing field and the grace of player movements amidst explosive
    action" (from the artist's website). <br><br>Joseph Jefferson Jackson
    (1887-1951), often remembered as "Shoeless Joe" because he sometimes played
    barefoot as a boy, was a star baseball player with Cleveland and the Chicago
    White Sox in the 1910s. He was among the eight "Black Sox" players charged
    with accepting bribes to lose the 1919 World Series, although his batting
    average was a very strong .375 and he was charged with no errors in the
    field. He was banned from baseball for life, and later barred from entry to
    the Hall of Fame, decisions which remain controversial to this day. The
    resonance of Jackson's story has transcended baseball and entered into
    American legend. The newspaper headline "Say it ain't so, Joe" remains part
    of the national lexicon.  He was portrayed by D.B. Sweeney in the 1988 John
    Sayles film <I>Eight Men Out,</i> and more memorably by Ray Liotta as a
    central figure in the 1989 film <I>Field of Dreams.</i> The Shoeless Joe
    Jackson Museum opened in his hometown of Greenville, SC in 2008.

    522-23. <br><br>In addition to his prolific work for <I>The Saturday Evening
    Post</i> at this time, Rockwell was also in high demand for calendars and
    print advertisements. Throughout the late 1930s and early `40s, he created
    several illustrations for Shenley's, speaking to their ideal customer, the
    sensualist imbiber with "knowing eyes" who seeks a more luxurious style of
    bourbon. The copy reads: "If you are this type you'll like this bourbon
    that's `Double Rich!'" An inset panel defines and arrow points to the
    specific physical features of Rockwell's drawing of one such young man in
    the know, poking his head out from a shower curtain: "Have you these
    features? Eyes - of a type who keeps calm-cool-contented; Lips - that
    rejoice in luxurious living." Presumably showering after a hot summer day,
    ready for a drink, as defined by the concluding copy "For you who love to
    bask in the cool luxury during summer warmth . . . the `Double-Rich'
    Kentucky straight Bourbon in highballs is ideal . . . try it!"

    lower left. Tipped to window matte. A copy of the printed card accompanies

    A Monthly for English Classes Published by Scholastic Magazines,</i>  Volume
    8, Number 3. December 1955. <br><br>Provenance: Private collection,
    California. <br><br>From 1945 to 1951, Steinberg created a popular series of
    whimsical black-and-white holiday cards for New York's Museum of Modern
    Art.  Soon after, in 1952, the greeting card giant Hallmark produced a
    series by famous artists and writers as part of their "Hall of Fame
    Collection." Besides Steinberg, notables included Grandma Moses, Winston
    Churchill, Norman Rockwell, Doris Lee, and the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale.
    The job was a lucrative one for Steinberg, paying $10,000 a year. The
    addition of color, a feature that the MoMA cards lacked, contributed to the
    charm of Steinberg's Hallmark designs. As described in the issue of
    <i>Cavalcade</i>, Steinberg felt "America's Santa was getting too set in his
    ways," with most depictions copying Thomas Nast's iconic St. Nick of the
    1860s. Steinberg therefore created his "liberated Santas" - embodying magic,
    fantasy and as "free as the imagination." <br>Compared to the original
    artwork, which contains only Santa's bright red suit and bits of silver
    paper doily collage serving as architectural details, the collage details on
    the mass-produced printed card are gold, and there is both an additional
    green paper appliqué on the center tower window as well as extra watercolor
    detail in the porch tree and doorway.

    Illustration published in Oscar Wilde's <i>Salome: A tragedy in One Act.</i>
    (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1927.) Gouache on Bainbridge board. Image measures
    500x381 mm; 19¼x15 inches, on 25x20-inch board. Not signed. Early window
    matte adhered to board, chip to upper right corner. <br><br>Vassos “worked
    in a very limited palette of black, white, silver, gray, and their
    intermediate shadings, always to startling effect. He illustrated relatively
    few authors during his active years-Coleridge, Gray, his wife Ruth Vassos,
    and his favorite, Oscar Wilde” (John Anzalone). Vassos published this
    version of Salome after creating a program cover for a 1926 stage
    production, and followed it with <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</i> in 1928
    and <i>The Harlot’s House and Other Poems</i> in 1929. “Wilde’s despondency
    and eroticism were perfectly portrayed with Vassos’ restricted palette of
    tones and shapes” (Jim Vadeboncoeur Jr.).“Art critic C.J. Bulliet called
    [Vassos]… ‘the first artist since Beardsley who has paralleled Wilde” (P.K.
    Thomajan). The play was first published in 1894 with illustrations by Aubrey
    Beardsley. “The text pages of [this] edition were showered with silvery
    stars, an added touch that befitted this historic lady of the evening.”
    (Thomajan). ADD REFERENCES.REWORK BIO:US industrial designer. Born in
    Romania as the son of a Greek publisher and diplomat, he served with a
    suicide minesweeper squadron in World War I, was torpedoed, rescued by a US
    transport and landed in Boston in 1919. There, he studied art and
    illustration with John Singer Sargent at the Fenway Art School.In 1924, he
    came to New York, opened a commercial studio called The New York Display
    Company, studied at the Art Students League, started as an illustrator for
    Harper's and New Yorker magazines, and began in the practice of industrial
    design. He wrote, illustrated and published a number of fiction books:
    Contempo, in 1929; Ultima in 1930; and Phobia in 1931.In 1933 he established
    the first internal design department for the Radio Corporation of America
    (RCA), and remained as its consultant until 1964, while continuing to
    practice independently. In 1938 he was one of the founders and the first
    president of the American Designers Institute. He urged the breakaway of the
    group from the Designers Institute of the American Furniture Mart to allow
    designers to work on many areas, not just furniture design. He served as its
    president again in 1948.In 1939 he designed the first consumer television
    sets for RCA that were introduced at the New York World's Fair, and he
    designed the theme and concept of the RCA pavilion there.With Alexander
    Kostellow, FIDSA among others, he developed early programs of industrial
    design education in the early 1940s and published Dogs are Like That in
    1941. During World War II, he was with the US Army Air Corps developing
    camouflage techniques, and, with the forerunner of the CIA, twice entered
    Greece secretly by parachute to organize the underground.He was president of
    the Silvermine Guild of Artists in CT and was elected the first Chairman of
    the Board of the Industrial Designers Society of America when it was formed
    in 1965.

    <br><br>Provenance: Palm Beach Galleries (with their label); private
    collection, New England.<br><br><i>Coco</i> was Hepburn's only stage musical
    of her career. Based on the lyrics and book by Alan Jay Lerner and with
    music by André Previn, it starred Hepburn in the titular role while Beaton
    created both its elaborate set and costume designs. Coco opened at the Mark
    Hellinger Theatre on December 18, 1969 and ran for 329 performances until
    its closing on October 3, 1970. The plot was originally focused on Chanel's
    earlier years but when Hepburn, who was 62 at the time, was chosen for the
    role, the story line was changed to focus on the designer's post-retirement
    comeback, a decision Chanel was not particularly thrilled about. Perhaps
    more flattering for Hepburn, it earned her the nominee for Best Actress in a
    Musical, and Beaton's costuming, beautifully shown in this rendering of Kate
    owning the Coco look, won him the Tony Award for Best Costume Design.

    manager of Frank Music Corporation, working on The Most Happy Fella, The
    Music Man, Greenwillow, and How to Succeed in Business Without Really
    Trying. By the time he was 28, Ostrow decided that he had enough experience
    to try producing on his own, and he flew to London to tell Loesser in person
    that he was leaving the company to produce his first solo venture, We Take
    the Town starring Robert Preston.<br><br>While We Take the Town never made
    it to Broadway, Ostrow went on to produce a great variety of successful
    shows. In 1963, he directed and produced Meredith Willson's Here's Love,
    based on A Miracle on 34th St. In the 1960s he also produced The Apple Tree
    (1966) and 1776 (1969), which received not only the New York and London
    Drama Critics Awards, but the Tony Award for Best Musical. (The Stuart

    stealing a hog, the only food they've had in days. In the fracas of the

    tattered and emaciated, to await the return of his master, inspires to boy
    to also carry on, while struggling to adulthood and suffering the regular
    taunts and assaults by convicts and guards as he searches for his father.

    the smallest one named Madeline saves Christmas for Miss Clavel and the
    other little girls in two straight lines. Bemelmans includes a bow to
    Clement C. Moore: “It was the night before Christmas, And all through the
    house, Nobody was stirring, Not even the mouse . . .  Because the mouse was
    in bed with a cold / Like everybody else in that house which was old.”

    <br><br>“Captain Boldheart” and “The Magic Fishbone” were originally part of

    published in his lifetime. In the 1960s, Macmillan editor Michael di Capua
    proposed the story to be included among a series of children’s classics he
    was producing, with new illustrations by prominent artists and commentary by
    notable writers. It was delayed, however, because it took so long for author
    Mary McCarthy to submit her foreword. As scholar Michael Hearn has observed,
    this image, with its cartoon-like violence reflects, Rockwell Kent’s 1928
    illustrations depicting similar atrocities for Voltaire’s <I>Candide</i>
    that fascinated Mr. Knight when he was a boy.

    she created paintings for friends and patrons, while working as an art
    director. Since her first exhibit in Boulder, Colorado, she has built a
    strong following, and her paintings reside in numerous private collections
    and museums. Her work is shown in galleries in United States, Canada, Europe
    and Japan (from the artist's biography).

    13½x19 inches, all on slightly larger boards. All signed "Zaffo" in
    different locations. A copy of the book accompanies the artwork.
    <br><br>Zaffo was a superbly talented writer, illustrator, and designer of
    children's books, with an output of over 95 titles over his career. An
    equally skilled technical artist and commercial craftsman, his commitment to
    accuracy, detail, and realism made his books stand out among others. An
    anecdote Zaffo told in print interviews and confirmed by his family supports
    his talent: Zaffo, who studied under Norman Rockwell for a year, bet his
    mentor that one day he would fool him with a watercolor version of a
    Rockwell oil and that the famous illustrator would not know which was which.
    Zaffo won the bet, and Rockwell conceded and signed the work. That signed
    painting remains a proud possession in Zaffo's family.  The bright and
    precise details in these images were painstakingly rendered as were those
    for similarly designed titles featuring machines and modes of transportation
    including <I>Big Book of Real Building and Wrecking Machines, The Big Book
    Of Real Trains, The Big Book of Real Trucks.</i>  Their popularity led First
    Lady Jacqueline Kennedy to acquire two of his titles for the White House

    pieces are unsigned, but hallmarks of his characteristic style are present
    throughout: the style and quality of inking; the way in which both
    characters' pupils are drawn; his advanced grasp of anatomy and affinity for
    certain types of character posing (including Goofy's outstretched foot,
    similar to a number of other Porter illustrations ) and his style of drawing
    digits and dog paws; and the particular way in which the WDP copyright is
    written.  Specifically, the style in in close keeping with his art produced
    in the late 1940s, as seen in cover art for publications such as <I>Western
    Family, Pictorial Review,</i> and <I>Rexall Magazine.</i> <br><br> Porter
    worked in effective anonymity under the Disney banner but made indelible
    contributions during his career to the areas of comics, magazine

    Courvoisier Galleries in the same fashion as their other early 1940s
    offerings (including those for Pinocchio and Dumbo), carefully trimmed to
    the shape of the character and adhered to an airbrushed presentation
    background with dry brush highlights. <br><br>Saludos Amigos (which
    premiered in Brazil August 24, 1942 and February 6th, 1943 in the US) marks
    the debut of the charming green parrot Joe Carioca (renamed José in
    subsequent films), who appears in the film's final segment "Aquarela Do
    Brasil." Production cels from Saludos Amigos are by far the scarcest that
    exist of the character, with cels from the later The Three Caballeros and
    various TV appearances being far more common. Carioca gets a fairly scant
    amount of screen time in this very short (42-minute run time) feature; thus,
    relatively few cels of him were ever made, and far fewer have survived.
    <br><br>The matching scene appears 38 minutes, 38 seconds into the film,
    shortly after we are introduced to the character. Donald Duck asks Joe:
    "Samba? What's Samba?" To which Joe replies "Ah, the Samba!" (this frame
    appearing during the word "Samba") -- which leads to a lively instrumental
    musical sequence.

    Walt Disney "Lady and the Tramp" animation production cel from the Art
    Corner at Disneyland, 1955. 260x305 mm; 10x12 inches, cel sheet; taped
    around perimeter to original 12x14-inch matte from Art Corner shop at
    Disneyland with  their gold authentication label on the verso. <br><br>The
    matching frame appears 1 hour 7 minutes 36 seconds into the film, as Tramp
    licks his wounds from his climactic fight with a rat who threatens the baby
    in Lady's home.  The style of matte, type of label, and date of production
    point to this being a very early example of an Art Corner setup, likely from
    the opening year of the park in 1955.

    Created for film shorts "Pink-A-Boo" (released June 26, 1966) and "Pink
    Valiant" (released July 10, 1968).  Gouache and (and on first, red grease
    pencil) over celluloid sheets. First image measures approximately 76x152 mm;
    4x6 inches, the second is 75x101 mm; 3x4 inches; each on 10½x12½-inch sheet.
    <br><br>The Pink Panther has appeared in numerous films and television shows
    since his debut in the opening titles of the classic 1963 Blake Edwards
    film.  Production cels from the 1960s cartoons such as these are scarce.
    <br><br>The Pink-A-Boo scene frame appears 3 minutes, 2 seconds into the
    short, when the Panther walks up to his nemesis mouse's hole to investigate
    the mob of mice that has just stormed his house, toting musical instruments
    and champagne. <br>The second cel from Pink Valiant appears near the end of
    the short at 5 minutes, 45 seconds, as Pink Valiant (an obvious spoof of Hal
    Foster's comic creation) proudly bows to a livid king, to whom he has just
    presented the "rescued" Black Knight, in lieu of the kidnapped princess.  
    DePatie-Freleng switched to using black Xerox lines later in the 1960s, as
    seen in this cel. The cel also bears a seldom seen period
    Geoffrey-Mirisch-Depatie copyright label. <br><br>The 1960s DePatie-Freleng
    Pink Panther shorts were in many ways direct successors to the classic
    Warner Bros cartoons, especially since they were made by many of the same
    staff (e.g. both films were directed by Warner veteran Hawley Pratt).

    young Fievel and Tanya Mousekewitz gathered around Papa as he tells them
    stories. This is a special example of a scarce cel, produced as a very small
    edition of 100, since it is marked as the first HC artist's proof, which was
    never intended for sale. <i>An American Tail</i> is the story of the
    Mousekewitzes, a family of Russian-Jewish immigrant mice, which focuses on
    young Feivel's journey to reunite with them.  The film was a box office
    success and provided further proof that Don Bluth's "upstart" studio could

    For this image of the great modern painter among a restrospective group of
    his works, she admitted to finding herself "getting right into the
    paintings, absorbing their spirit, content, and brushwork." Having put so
    much emphasis on Weber's work than the artist himself, she put his "modest
    head and shoulders" in the right hand corner of the work as if he were the
    signature" identifying the works on the wall above him (page 170). "The

    day ping-ponging country names off each other, and sketching maps. It would
    be Trump’s map, drawn by him, not us, and he’d think everyplace in the world
    he didn’t own is a Shithole. The sketches and the names were so much fun you
    could hardly call it work, and the final map is one of the best things we’ve

    Published in  Illustration for <i>The Katzenjammer Kids Animated Novelty

    432x254 mm; 17x10 inches, sheet. Not signed, but with editorial marks in
    margins and verso. <br><br>This illustration contains the designs for all
    the components of the die-cut paper machinery included on a single spread. 
    The action in the final book works as follows: when the lever is pushed
    down, the Katzenjammers Hans and Fritz hide in a tree while their rival
    Rollo pricks The Captain with a pin, who then jumps in the air. The book is
    credited to Harold Knerr, but the interior illustrations far more closely
    resemble the hand of Joe Musial, a long-time staff artist at King Features
    who did ghost work for a range of comic strips.  Around this time Musial
    drew many memorable covers for the Ace Comics Katzenjammer Kids series. 
    Musial officially took over the Katzenjammer Kids comic strip duties in

    Cuthbert J. Twillie in the 1940 film "My Little Chickadee." Here, Sorel
    reveals Nixon's hand in a visual bubble where we see that he is holding a
    terrible hand; a busted flush and a busted straight; his only move now is to
    bluff the other players at the table into thinking he holds better cards

  CROSSHEAD: Papering the Tree.
  TYPESET: >-
    Cover illustration for <i>The New Yorker,</i> published December 21, 1992.
    Watercolor, graphite, and ink on paper. 280x215 mm; 11x8½ inches, on
    13½x9½-inch paper. Initialed "EG" in lower right image. Tipped to matte;
    verso blank. <br><br>Provenance: The Edward Gorey Charitable Trust,
    consigned to support its mission of maintaining Gorey's artistic legacy and
    the animal welfare organizations he supported.<br><br>The last color
    magazine cover by Edward Gorey published in his lifetime and one of only two
    published New Yorker covers by him. This image, featuring a family festively
    trimming a bizarre, denuded Christmas tree (and, in the process, the family
    pets) with poinsettia wrapping paper, appeared on the December 21, 1992
    Christmas week cover. While this was the only New Yorker cover published in
    Gorey's lifetime, a second watercolor submitted with it, "Cat Fancy,"
    languished in their archives, 18 years after his death and nearly forgotten
    until 2018 when editor Françoise Mouly rediscovered the illustration upon
    the submission of an appreciation of Gorey by Joan Acocella. In belated
    homage, it graced their December 3, 2018 issue. That original drawing,
    featuring cozy felines camouflaged in a riotously patterned bed comforter,
    was sold in our showrooms the following June.<br><br>Over the course of his
    career, Gorey created a total of thirty-four published covers for magazines.
    Among those, only eight were in full color though some contained small
    watercolor additions or backgrounds. Gorey scholar and collector Irwin Terry
    noted that an additional four were unpublished. His excellent posts on
    Gorey's magazine covers can be found on his blog goreyana.blogspot.com and
    his helpful research and assistance is greatly appreciated.

  DESCRIPT: WILLIAM HAMILTON (1939-2016) (THE NEW YORKER)
  CROSSHEAD: Cartoonist's sketch book.
  TYPESET: >-
    Green "Artspiral" sketchbook with 14 pages of drawings in ink, in various
    stages of development and with corrections. <br><br>One apparently finished
    cartoon, picturing three WASPy male friends relaxing with a bottle, bears
    the pencilled caption: "You Call That a Problem? My Wife Makes Twice as Much
    as That." Other pencilled notes read "[Hi]ding the rawness of my ambition";
    "That's when I was militarized"; and "FAX 415-614-2700." Yhough the drawings
    are unsigned, Hamilton's wit and style are unmistakable.
