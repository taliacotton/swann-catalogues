    Etching.  303x252 mm; 11⅞x9⅞ inches, wide margins.  Edition of 35 (from an

    88.<br><br>Cook, most widely known for his lyrical prints of Manhattan, was
    born in Massachusetts and traveled the continental United States
    extensively.  As a young man, he moved to New York and enrolled in the Art
    Students League.  He studied printmaking there under Joseph Pennell
    (1857-1926) who, nearing the end of his life, was characterized by his
    atmospheric cityscape etchings. Cook's interest in the medium increased
    after a trip to Paris in 1925, where he spent time with fellow ex-pats and
    master printmakers James E. Allen (1894-1964) and Thomas Handforth
    (1897-1948).<br><br>Cook's career took off after a 1926 trip to Maine, when
    woodcuts he made there were picked up by <i>Forum</i>, one of the most
    widely-circulated American magazines at the time.  The publication
    subsequently commissioned Cook to create woodcuts of the American Southwest,
    where he became enamored with New Mexico and the Taos artist's colony,
    returning throughout his life (he relocated there permanently in 1939 and
    ultimately died in Santa Fe).  By the end of the 1920s, Cook's adept
    printmaking caught the interest of Carl Zigrosser (1891-1975), the esteemed
    director of the Weyhe Gallery in New York who supported many emerging
    artists.  In 1929, Zigrosser both hosted Cook's first solo exhibition and
    encouraged him to travel to Paris, providing him entrée into the venerable
    lithography studio Atelier Desjobert. Despite experimenting in a range of
    printmaking techniques, the woodcut remained Cook's medium of
    choice.<br><br>At the peak of his career, from the late 1920s until his 1939
    move to New Mexico, Cook feverishly depicted a rapidly-changing New York. 
    Construction on skyscrapers flourished in the interwar period, with landmark
    towers like the Chrysler Building completed in 1930 and the Empire State
    Building completed the following year, while the Great Depression halted
    progress on other projects and construction sites remained commonplace. 
    Cook was employed by the Works Progress Administration during this time.
    Artists like Cook, Louis Lozowick (1892-1973), and Samuel Margolies
    (1897-1974) embraced the evolving city as their subject, using exaggerated
    perspective to emphasize the grandeur of buildings, and portraying
    construction workers as everyday heroes.

    years later, Wood created <i>Tree Planting Group</i> and subsequently, in
    several years following, the remaining 18 lithographs which comprise his
    entire printed <i>oeuvre</i>.<br><br>Wood was one of the most well-known
    muralists of the WPA, having rose to celebrity status after his painting
    "American Gothic" won a bronze medal at the Art Institute of Chicago. Wood
    had always wished to re-create the midwest as an arts center and helped to
    found an artist colony in his native Cedar Rapids in 1932. In the Iowa
    University Parks Library in Ames, Iowa, Wood produced a series of murals in
    his archetypal American regionalist style (a first set for the Public Works
    of Art Project in 1934, a second in 1936 under the WPA). Wood also was also
    involved in the production of another Iowan mural project at the Callanan
    Middle School in Des Moines for the Federal Arts Project.

    1929.<br><br>A superb, dark impression of this extremely scarce etching. 
    Sasowsky 63.  <br><br>Born in Paris, the second son in a well-to-do family,
    Marsh attended Yale University and then moved to New York where, during the
    early 1920s, he worked as an illustrator and took classes at the Art
    Students League. Marsh was equally influenced by his art teachers in New
    York, notably John Sloan (1871-1951), as well as American Regionalists like
    Thomas Hart Benton (1889-1975) and Old Masters such as Rubens, Titian and
    Tintoretto. He wholly rejected the modern artistic movements gaining
    strength in America at the time—Cubism, Surrealism, Abstraction. Instead he
    pursued a style that is best summed up as social realism: depictions of
    everyday life in New York, Coney Island beach scenes, vaudeville and
    burlesque women, the jobless on the streets of New York and the railroad
    yards and freight trains in New York and New Jersey.<br><br>He participated
    in the federal art programs under the WPA, painting two murals in
    Washington, DC, and, funded by the Treasury Relief Art Project, completed a
    series of frescoes in the New York Customs House, now the National Museum of
    the American Indian, that depict eight New York Harbor scenes and eight
    portraits of great navigators. It is one of the most celebrated mural
    installations created under the New Deal in New York City.

    gave opportunities and financial help to many artists who were struggling
    during the Depression. Sloan, already an established artist and teacher at
    the Art Students League (who taught many artists who particapted in the WPA
    programs), did not fit that profile, but he did participate in the Treasury
    Section of Fine Arts, which hired well-known artists for its projects. He
    painted the mural <i>The Arrival of the First Mail</i> in Bronxville in 1846
    for the post office in Bronxville, New York. He also created two paintings
    for the WPA, one <i>The Wigwam, Old Tammany Hall</i>, now in the collection
    of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the other <i>Fourteenth Street
    at Sixth Avenue</i>, originally hung the office of U.S. Sen. Royal Copeland
    and now is exhibited at the Detroit Insitute of Arts.

  CROSSHEAD: 'Bremen #2.'
  TYPESET: >-
    Wood engraving.  281x203 mm; 11¼x8 inches, small margins.  Edition of only
    30 (from an intended edition of 50).  1931.<br><br>Cook, most widely known
    for his lyrical prints of Manhattan, was born in Massachusetts and traveled
    the continental United States extensively.  As a young man, he moved to New
    York and enrolled in the Art Students League.  He studied printmaking there
    under Joseph Pennell (1857-1926) who, nearing the end of his life, was
    characterized by his atmospheric cityscape etchings. Cook's interest in the
    medium increased after a trip to Paris in 1925, where he spent time with
    fellow ex-pats and master printmakers James E. Allen (1894-1964) and Thomas
    Handforth (1897-1948).<br><br>Cook's career took off after a 1926 trip to
    Maine, when woodcuts he made there were picked up by <i>Forum</i>, one of
    the most widely-circulated American magazines at the time.  The publication
    subsequently commissioned Cook to create woodcuts of the American Southwest,
    where he became enamored with New Mexico and the Taos artist's colony,
    returning throughout his life (he relocated there permanently in 1939 and
    ultimately died in Santa Fe).  By the end of the 1920s, Cook's adept
    printmaking caught the interest of Carl Zigrosser (1891-1975), the esteemed
    director of the Weyhe Gallery in New York who supported many emerging
    artists.  In 1929, Zigrosser both hosted Cook's first solo exhibition and
    encouraged him to travel to Paris, providing him entrée into the venerable
    lithography studio Atelier Desjobert. Despite experimenting in a range of
    printmaking techniques, the woodcut remained Cook's medium of
    choice.<br><br>At the peak of his career, from the late 1920s until his 1939
    move to New Mexico, Cook feverishly depicted a rapidly-changing New York. 
    Construction on skyscrapers flourished in the interwar period, with landmark
    towers like the Chrysler Building completed in 1930 and the Empire State
    Building completed the following year, while the Great Depression halted
    progress on other projects and construction sites remained commonplace. 
    Cook was employed by the Works Progress Administration during this time.
    Artists like Cook, Louis Lozowick (1892-1973), and Samuel Margolies
    (1897-1974) embraced the evolving city as their subject, using exaggerated
    perspective to emphasize the grandeur of buildings, and portraying
    construction workers as everyday heroes.

    and took classes at the Art Students League. Marsh was equally influenced by
    his art teachers in New York, notably John Sloan (1871-1951), as well as
    American Regionalists like Thomas Hart Benton (1889-1975) and Old Masters
    such as Rubens, Titian and Tintoretto. He wholly rejected the modern
    artistic movements gaining strength in America at the time—Cubism,
    Surrealism, Abstraction.  Instead he pursued a style that is best summed up
    as social realism: depictions of everyday life in New York, Coney Island
    beach scenes, vaudeville and burlesque women, the jobless on the streets of
    New York and the railroad yards and freight trains in New York and New
    Jersey.<br><br>He participated in the federal art programs under the WPA,
    painting two murals in Washington, DC, and, funded by the Treasury Relief
    Art Project, completed a series of frescoes in the New York Customs House,
    now the National Museum of the American Indian, that depict eight New York
    Harbor scenes and eight portraits of great navigators.  It is one of the
    most celebrated mural installations created under the New Deal in New York

    mastered a variety of techniques, including etching, woodcut and
    lithography. An extremely dynamic artist, Barnet changed his style
    significantly throughout his career. His earliest graphic works captured the
    social and economic despair which resulted from the Great Depression; during
    these years he also worked for the WPA, producing prints for the graphics
    arts division.

    A member of the Communist Party of America, he focused his career on making
    artwork that was accessible to the public, such as illustrations in
    newspapers and magazines, murals and posters. In 1938, he painted the murals
    at the Communications Building at the New York World's Fair; during the
    fair's planning he also oversaw he formation of a labor union to protect the
    rights of artists as it was being planned.  He continued to remain loyal to
    the Communist Party throughout his career and life, founding the American
    Artist's Congress, a Communist organization, and eventually facing
    investigation by the House of Un-American Activities Committee.

    Signed and titled in pencil, lower margin.  Published by Associated American
    Artists, New York.  1947.<br><br>A superb, richly-inked impression.  Grayson
    13.<br><br>Albright was a native of Chicago and an American painter,
    sculptor and printmaker most renowned for his self-portraits, character
    studies and still lifes.  He honed a fiercely independent style which
    focused on highlighting the minute detail and texture of every surface,
    often requiring him to spend years or even decades on a single work.  Though
    he worked under the auspices of the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) in
    1933-34 and the Works Progress Administration (WPA) for a few months in
    1936, Albright generally seemed to disdain the contemporary work of many
    other American Regionalist and Realist artists who worked in these
    governement supported programs.  His oil on canvas, <i>The Farmer's
    Kitchen</i>, 1933-34, now in the Smithsonian American Art Museum,
    Washington, DC, which comes closest to capturing the feeling in the works of
    American Regionalist artists, shows a weary woman seated and peeling a bunch
    of radishes in a hard-scrabble farm kitchen.   The scene is almost a parody
    of works by Grant Wood (1891-1942) or John Steuart Curry (1897-1946). 
    Albright summed up his view of the American Regionalists popular at the
    time, observing, "There is that group of American Sceners whose pictures are
    more news bulletins than art.  They picture the tornado, the flood, the
    drought lands, the TVA, but pathetically enough are six months behind the
    newspaper headlines and photographs.”

    Marsh attended Yale University and then moved to New York where, during the
    early 1920s, he worked as an illustrator and took classes at the Art
    Students League. Marsh was equally influenced by his art teachers in New
    York, notably John Sloan (1871-1951), as well as American Regionalists like
    Thomas Hart Benton (1889-1975) and Old Masters such as Rubens, Titian and
    Tintoretto. He wholly rejected the modern artistic movements gaining
    strength in America at the time—Cubism, Surrealism, Abstraction. Instead he
    pursued a style that is best summed up as social realism: depictions of
    everyday life in New York, Coney Island beach scenes, vaudeville and
    burlesque women, the jobless on the streets of New York and the railroad
    yards and freight trains in New York and New Jersey.<br><br>Marsh 
    participated in the federal art programs under the WPA, painting two murals
    in Washington, DC, and, funded by the Treasury Relief Art Project, completed
    a series of frescoes in the New York Customs House, now the National Museum
    of the American Indian, that depict eight New York Harbor scenes and eight
    portraits of great navigators.  It is one of the most celebrated mural
    installations created under the New Deal in New York City.

    painter, printmaker and designer.  Known especially for her colorful
    woodcuts, she was an early modernist artist, at the vanguard of the
    avant-garde in American art, bringing elements of Cubism and abstraction
    into her craft.  Lazzell made color woodcuts under the auspices of the WPA
    during the 1930s, among them one of her most celebrated works, <i>The Blue
    Jug </i>, 1937, the design of which is similar to <i>The Coffee Pot</i> on

    of Lower Manhattan in 1789 and 1939. He cleverly breaks through the top

    his studies at the Art Institute of Chicago. Although virtually unknown in
    the poster community, he became a prolific illustrator for magazines
    including <i>Esquire, Fortune,</i> and <i>Motor</i> and produced
    advertisements for Coca-Cola and United Airlines as well as the auto
    industry. His trademark style was the ultimate in "luminous Art Deco . . . a
    sense of industrial design that was both pragmatic and prescient; he took
    what was cutting edge . . . and made them more elegant, functional and
    fantastical to behold" (http://arthur-radebaugh.blogspot.com/). This image

    90.<br><br>Benton was already seen as a leader in the Regionalist movement
    and a celebrated muralist by the time the WPA started the Federal Arts
    Program. He had been commissioned to paint murals of life in Indiana for the
    1933 Century of Progress Exhibition in Chicago, which caused controversy. In
    1934, his work was featured on the cover on <i>Time</i> magazine, which
    legitimized Regionalism as an art movement. His murals were influential for
    many of the artists hired as muralists under the WPA.

    a well-to-do family, Marsh attended Yale University and then moved to New
    York where, during the early 1920s, he worked as an illustrator and took
    classes at the Art Students League.  Marsh was equally influenced by his art
    teachers in New York, notably John Sloan (1871-1951), as well as American
    Regionalists like Thomas Hart Benton (1889-1975) and Old Masters such as
    Rubens, Titian and Tintoretto.  He wholly rejected the modern artistic
    movements gaining strength in America at the time—Cubism, Surrealism,
    Abstraction. Instead he pursued a style that is best summed up as social
    realism: depictions of everyday life in New York, Coney Island beach scenes,
    vaudeville and burlesque women, the jobless on the streets of New York and
    the railroad yards and freight trains in New York and New Jersey.<br><br>He
    participated in the federal art programs under the WPA, painting two murals
    in Washington, DC, and, funded by the Treasury Relief Art Project, completed
    a series of frescoes in the New York Customs House, now the National Museum
    of the American Indian, that depict eight New York Harbor scenes and eight
    portraits of great navigators.  It is one of the most celebrated mural
    installations created under the New Deal in New York City.

    Circa 1935-40.<br><br>Robinson was born in Nova Scotia and moved the Boston
    in the early 1890s.  After studying art in Boston and Paris, he worked as an
    illustrator in the early 1900s.  His highly political cartoons as well as
    the general anti-war stance of <i>The Masses</i>, to which he was a frequent
    contributor, was deemed to have violated the recently passed Espionage Act
    of 1917, and <i>The Masses</i> had to cease publication, though Robinson,
    along with his fellow defendants were acquitted on October 5, 1918. 
    Robinson would later go on to teach art at the Art Students League in New
    York (1919–30) and head the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center (1936–47). 
    During the 1920s and 1930s he was also a sought after muralist and some of
    his murals include <i>A History of Commerce</i>, 1929, a series of ten
    murals in Kaufmann's Department Store, Pittsburgh; <i>Man and his Toys</i>,
    1932, in the R. K. O. (now American Metal Climax) Building, New York; and

    he would frequent Harlem jazz clubs along with Stuart Davis (1892-1964). In
    addition to his New York genre scenes, he and his wife, the painter Theresa
    Bernstein (1895-2002), were involved with the circle of artists in
    Gloucester, Massachusetts, where they spent their summers painting landscape
    and maritime scenes.<br><br>During the Great Depression, Meyerowitz was a

    richly-inked impression of this extremely scarce
    lithograph.<br><br>According to the Terra Foundation, Brodsky is best known
    for lithograph images of Philadelphia and the surrounding area made in the
    1930s and 1940s.  A native of Newark, New Jersey, Brodsky graduated from the
    Philadelphia College of Art and also attended the University of
    Pennsylvania.  In the late 1920s, he painted decorative works in the
    interiors of movie theaters in Haddon Township, New Jersey, and Ambler,
    Pennsylvania.  In 1934, Brodsky's work was included in the exhibition
    "Paintings and Prints by Philadelphia Artists" at the Whitney Museum of
    American Art, New York, and in the following two decades he participated in
    numerous other shows in national and international venues.  His work won a
    purchase prize at the Brooklyn Museum in 1947, and the following year
    garnered another prize at Philadelphia's Print Club, of which he was an
    active member.  During the 1940s and 1950s Brodsky taught at vocational
    schools in Philadelphia.  He later worked as a commercial artist for the
    Campbell's Soup Company, for the weekly entertainment magazine <i>TV
    Guide</i>, and for Philadelphia advertising agencies.<br><br>Brodsky created
    some of the more haunting images of the WPA, particularly in his
    lithographs, acting as a zeitgeist for the pressing issues of his time and
    emphasizing themes of social justice in portrayals of workers and the
    down-and-out in America.
