  DESCRIPT: GRAFTON TYLER BROWN  (1841 - 1918)
  CROSSHEAD: Untitled (Sailboat on a Mountain Lake).
  year: '1892'
  TYPESET: >-
    Oil on linen canvas, 1891. 305x457 mm; 12x18 inches. Signed and dated in
    oil, lower left.<br><br>Provenance: private collection, Maryland, acquired
    at Clars Auction Gallery, April 17, 2016.<br><br>This charming scene is an
    example of the early Western landscapes of Grafton Tyler Brown. Born in
    Harrisburg, PA to a family of freed slaves from Maryland, Brown's family
    moved to San Francisco in 1855. There Brown began working for the
    lithography firm of Kuchel & Dresel, specializing in drawing maps and
    bird's-eye views of cities and towns in Nevada and California. After the
    owners' death, Brown purchased the firm, renaming it G.T. Brown & Co., but
    he then sold the business in 1879 in order to devote his time to painting.
    He moved to Victoria, BC, joining the Canadian government's geological
    survey of the Cascade Mountains in 1883. The following year he moved again,
    this time to Washington state, where he frequently painted Mt. Rainier. From
    1886 to 1889, the artist had a studio and home in Portland, OR, where he was
    a member of the Portland Art Club. But by 1892, Brown was on the move again,
    relocating to St. Paul, MN, where he remained until his death in 1918.
    Today, his prized landscapes are found in institutional collections
    including the Smithsonian American Museum of Art and the National Museum of
    African American History and Culture, Washington, DC.

    estate of Allan O. Hunter, Jr., acquired at Swann Galleries, October 4,
    2018.<br><br>This canvas is a very scarce painting by John Harold Devon or
    J. H. D. Robinson, whom little is known about today, but was fairly active
    during the Harlem Renaissance in New York. He exhibited paintings in two
    significant exhibitions of the 1930s - <i>Exhibition of the Work of Negro
    Artists</i>, Harmon Foundation, New York in February of 1931, and
    <i>Paintings and Sculpture by American Negro Artists</i>,the Renaissance
    Society, the University of Chicago in December of 1936. According to a brief
    biography found in the Negro Statistical Bulletin of 1935, issued by the
    Department of Commerce, Robinson studied at the Brooklyn Art School, the Art
    Students League under Thomas Hart Benton, New York University and the
    College Art Association. The biography adds that he painted four canvases
    under the P.W.A.P, and also exhibited at the 135th Street Branch of the New
    York Public Library and the Nicholas Roerich Museum, New York in 1934.

    A later printing by the artist at Fisk University.<br><br>This extremely
    scarce print is a striking representation of a hero of the Harlem
    Renaissance by Aaron Douglas, a small portrait of the poet Langston Hughes
    as a young man. Another impression, titled <i>Portrait of Langston
    Hughes</i>, an unsigned proof, printed in brown and gold metallic ink, is in
    the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The museum also has
    <i>Portrait of Countee Cullen</i>, another very similar Douglas woodcut.
    Both date from the same year as the artist's <i>The Emporer Jones</i> series
    of woodcuts. The artist later revisited these blocks, in addition to making
    new etchings like <i>Window Shopper</i> and <i>The Junkman</i>, after taking
    a printmaking class in the summer of 1955 taught by Walter Rogalksi at the
    Brookyln Museum Art School. Earle p. 221.

  TYPESET: >-
    Color pastel on fine sandpaper, 1935. 508x355 mm; 22x15¼ inches. Signed and
    dated in pencil, lower right.<br><br>Provenance: private collection,
    Ohio.<br><br>Norman Lewis drew this beautiful drawing after visiting a 1935
    exhibition of African art at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. A
    photograph of this sculpture is also illustrated in the catalogue for the
    MoMA exhibition <i>African Negro Art</i>, curated by James Johnson Sweeney
    who intended to show modernism's roots in African Art. The exhibiton had a
    profound effect on Lewis - he created a wonderful series of detailed and
    colorful pastel drawings of the sculptures he had seen.<br><br>This drawing
    is of an ancestral sculpture, a carved wood figure of a woman made by the
    Bangwa, a people indigenous to western Cameroon. Now best known as the
    <i>Bangwa Queen</i>, it is one of the most famous and important African
    sculptures. The sculpture was taken from the Bangwa by a German colonial
    agent before Germany had colonised the area. After being in the collection
    of the Museum für VölkerkundeIt in Berlin, it was sold privately to an art
    dealer in 1926 who then sold it to Helena Rubenstein in the 1930s who lent
    it to the MoMA exhibition. Collector Harry Franklin then acquired the
    sculpture from Rubenstein in 1966, and then his daughter sold the work for a
    record price at Sotheby's in 1990, where it was acquired by the Dapper
    Foundation in Paris. Man Ray made two photographs of the <i>Bangwa Queen</i>
    figure in 1934, posed alongside a nude model.<br><br>The exhibition
    <i>African Negro Art</i> clearly resonated with Lewis and other African
    American artists of the Harlem Renaissance and were influenced by
    philosopher Alain Locke's exhortation to find artistic models in African
    art. In 1935, Lewis also joined the 306 group of writers and artists in
    Harlem who met in the studios of Henry Bannarn and Charles Alston, and was a
    founding member for the Harlem Artist Guild with Alston, Augusta Savage,
    Arthur Schomburg and Elba Lightfoot. The MoMA exhibition, which was on view
    from March 18 to May 19, attracted many artist visitors including Alston,
    Romare Bearden, and Gwendoline and Jacob Lawrence.<br><br>Other known
    examples of these extraordinary 1935 drawings include <i>Baule Mask</i>,
    <i>Ivory Coast Baule Mask</i>, <i>Bobin (Boobin, Loom, Baule</i>, <i>Carved
    Bobbin (Guru)</i> and <i>Dan Mask</i>, four of which were included in
    <i>Procession, The Art of Norman Lewis</i>, his 2015 retrospective curated
    by Ruth Fine, and <i>Untitled (Head of a Mule, French Sudan)</i>, sold at
    Swann Galleries on December 10, 2020. Fine pp. 24-25, 248.

    fascinating portait of one of Charles White's heroes is one of the earliest
    known drawings by the artist to come to auction. Another, very similar
    version of this drawing of Diego Rivera was sold at Swann Galleries as lot
    22 in African-American Fine Art auction on April 2, 2015, and is catalogued
    as D10 in Lucinda Gedeon's catalogue raisonné.<br><br>This early study was
    likely made just before or at the beginning of Charles White's study at the
    Art Institute of Chicago. White was determined to become an artist despite
    his family's tight finances, and early rejections from discriminatory art
    schools. White won a $240 scholarship to attend the Chicago Art Institute,
    entering in 1937. White completed the two year course in one year, despite
    often walking the 60 blocks home to save money and working as a cook and
    valet. Upon his graduation in 1938, he soon qualified to join the easel and
    mural divisions of the Federal Art Project in Illinois.<br><br>Diego
    Rivera's international fame and the rise of the Mexican muralists made a
    profound impact on Charles White and many other social realists' art work.
    In the mural divison of the FAP, White worked with muralists Mitchell
    Siporin and Edward Millman who both had assisted Rivera on murals in Mexico.
    Later in 1947, upon winning a Rosenwald scholarship to travel and study in
    Mexico, White met Diego Rivera and studied with David Alfaro Siqueiros at
    the Esmeralda Escuela del Arte and the Taller de Gráfica Popular in Mexico
    City. Curiously, despite a strong resemblance, an identification of Rivera
    was never made with this drawing.

    Hardrick won the Harmon bronze (first place) medal in 1927, frequently

    with a PhD in philosophy from the University of California, Berkeley. A
    Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University from 1920-21 and 1930-1940; he

    Richmond Barthé</i>, Harmon Foundation brochure, reproduced in Samella
    Lewis, <i>Barthé: His Life in Art</i> p. 68.<br><br><i>African Boy
    Dancing</i> is an important and strikingly beautiful bronze by Richomond
    Barthé - representing the culmination of Richmond Barthé's significant study
    of the male figure in sculpture, anatomy and African dance in the 1930s, and
    his pioneering realization of an ideal male nude.<br><br><I>African Boy
    Dancing</i> shares many of its defining characteristics with Barthé's iconic
    1935 <I>Feral Benga</i>. Appearing grander than its actual height, this
    natural and sensual repesentation of the male figure was made at the height
    of the artists's career. This lithe dancing figure is also part of Barthé's
    groundbreaking evocation of both male and homosexual sexuality in early 20th
    century American Art. The modelling emphasizes the dancer's lean physique,
    while the pose conveys a fluid, rythmic movement. When seen in the round,
    Barthé's technical expertise and attention to the totatlity of the figure is
    evident. Both figures also share a very expressive modelling and finish for
    cast bronze - Barthé's 1930s bronzes wonderfully convey much of the
    immediacy of his clay model. Art historian and Barthé scholar Margaret
    Vendryes has written extensively on Barthe's attention to detail:<br><br>"At
    the height of his career, Barthé took great pains with the finish of his
    sculpture. Foundry work received vigilant scrutiny to ensure that the bronze
    was chased to a seamless finish and read true to its original clay model. 
    The traces of pulled and smoothed clay created with fingers and tools
    animate figures like <i>Feral Benga</i> and act as a road map of Barthé's
    meticulous rendering methods. This practice also reflected his admiration
    for the late 19th century French master Auguste Rodin who left impressions
    on surfaces that are his signature."<br><br><i>African Boy Dancing</i> is an
    extremely rare bronze. In 1937, six of Barthé's African dancer bronze
    figures, including <i>African Boy Dancing</i>, were shown in the prestigious
    month-long exhibtion <i>Dance International, 1900 - 1937</i> at the
    Rockefeller Center, New York, In 1939, the Barnett-Aden Gallery of
    Washington, DC also exhibited a cast of <i>African Boy Dancing</i> at
    Oberlin College. Another later cast of <I>African Boy Dancing</i> was
    included in the Landau traveling exhibiton <i>Richmond Barthé</i> curated by
    Samella Lewis. This is only the second time that an original cast of a 1930s
    figure has appeared at auction; an early cast of<i>An African Dancer</i>,
    1934, was sold at Bonham's, San Francisco in 2005. Several of Richmond
    Barthé's mid-career bronzes were cast at the Cellini Bronze Works in
    Brooklyn, New York: including <i>An African Dancer</i> and the <I>The
    Boxer</i>, 1942, in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago and the
    Metropolitan Museum of Art.

  CROSSHEAD: Stevedore.
  year: '1937'
  TYPESET: >-
    Cast bronze with a dark brown patina on a green marble base, 1937.
    778x508x368 mm; 30⅝x20x14½ inches (not including marble base). Cast in 1985
    under the supervision of the artist and the Richmond Barthé Trust. Incised
    with artist's signature, date, numbered 2/8 and incised "©", right base
    edge.<br><br>Provenance: private collection, Los Angeles.<br><br>This iconic
    work by Richmond Barthé is an important and large bronze by the artist made
    at the peak of his career. Margaret Vendryes describes this sculpture of
    muscular dock worker standing on a i-beam in great length - he is both
    "Barthé's most aggressive black male figure" and "a personal statement".
    With the epitome of a chiseled physique and commanding presence, the figure
    of a longshoreman was elevated to great heights by the artist. Barthé had
    created both a new type of masculine presence in his oeuvre, and a new
    depiction of a powerful black man.<br><br><i>Stevedore</i> was a
    non-commissioned work made from the artist's own funds. Vendryes describes
    how Barthé kept it out of storage and with him when he moved. He later
    gifted his cast to the St. Ann's Parish Public Library in Jamiaca. This
    later cast has a longer rope that extends above the hand. This is only the
    second time a cast of <i>Stevedore</i> has come to auction: another was sold
    at Swann Galleries on October 15, 2017. Another example of this 1985 casting
    is the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Vendryes pp. 92-96.

    Harald Kreutzberg (1902 - 1968). Kreutzberg is an important figure in German
    ballet and modern dance whom Richmond Barthé befriended when he performed in
    New York in the 1930s. Barthé made several sculptures of the expressive
    dancer in busts and figures. Barthé himself had studied Martha Graham dance
    techniques in an effort to more fully understand the movement and form of
    dancing figures.<br><br>A plaster cast of this head was exhibited and

    53.<br><br><i>Artist’s Studio Party</i> is the largest and most significant
    painting by Joseph Delaney to come to auction. This important painting is
    part of his expressive body of work recording the lives of New Yorkers.
    Joseph Delaney gives the viewer a fascinating view of the downtown artist's
    scene - painting in thin layers with a dark, somber palette.<br><br>Joseph
    Delaney became a long time resident of the West Village art scene shortly
    after moving to New York to join his brother Beauford in 1930. Frederick
    Moffatt describes how Delaney lived in various garrets and lofts within a
    small area of the Village and Soho between 1931 and 1959. In 1940, Delaney
    lived on Sullivan Street, near West Third Street. Sam Yates wrote this
    painting was inspired by a party he gave friends earlier at 26 Bond
    Street.<br><br>In 1930, Joseph Delaney first studied at the Art Students
    League where he studied figure drawing with George Bridgman and human
    anatomy with Thomas Hart Benton. From 1934 to 1940, Delaney worked on
    various WPA projects in New York including the Index of Design for the
    Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Pier 72 mural, and with Norman Lewis on the
    <i>Story of the Recorded Word</i> mural at the New York Public Library. In
    1942, Delaney eventually join the easel division just before the WPA was
    disbanded, and was also awarded a Julius Rosenwald travel fellowship of
    $1,200, which he used to work and travel down the Eastern coast, from Maine
    to South Carolina.<br><br><i>Artist’s Studio Party</i> inclusion in the
    Studio Museum in Harlem exhibition <i>Invisible Americans</i> helped cement
    Joseph Delany's reputation as an important figture of the 1930s. In his
    <i>Artforum</i> review of February of 1969, Robert Pincus-Whitten hailed
    Joseph Delaney; "a single artist of tremendous merit was revealed to me in
    terms of a developed, tough, and by moments self-mocking Expressionism".
    Pincus-Whitten describes <i>Village Studio Party</i> as a "scene of group
    camaraderie an image of what must have seemed then to be the daring option
    of depicting a white girl dancing with a black man." In another studio
    painting, <i>Artist's Party</i>, circa 1942, Delaney includes himself seated
    at a poker game in an artist's apartment alongside a figure he later
    identified as Jackson Pollock. Both paintings are described in Frederick C.
    Moffatt's biography <i>Life and Times of Joseph Delaney, 1904 - 1991</i> and
    are recognized for taking the viewer into the "sanctified" space of the
    artist's studio. Moffatt p. 167; Moffat/Yates p. 53; Pincus-Whitten p. 66;
    Yates p. 12.

    Catlett, cast in bronze after one of her earliest figures. The original
    plaster <i>Pensive</i> followed the theme of the four terra cotta figures
    exhibited in her 1946 first solo exhibition at the Barnett-Aden Gallery in
    Washington, DC: <i>Negro Woman</i>, <i>Tired</i>, <i>Cold</i> and
    <i>Frustration</i>. Catlett importantly first represented modern Black women
    in her <i>Negro Woman</i> series - a narrative of identity, experience and
    representation. These figures show the physical nature and toll of their
    struggle. With her rolled up sleeves, crossed arms and leaning posture,
    <i>Pensive</i> is an expressive representation, sharing the modern
    simplified and angular features found in Catlett's <i>Woman</i>, 1942, oil
    on canvas, and <i>Negro Woman</i>, lithograph, 1945.<br><br>Catlett did not
    begin making bronze sculpture until the early 1960s. She made the mold and
    cast the first bronze of <i>Pensive</i> after the 1946 plaster figure in
    1967. Samella Lewis recorded both the 1946 plaster and a 1978 cast in a list
    of Catlett's sculpture in her 1984 monograph <i>The Art of Elizabeth
    Catlett</i>. The final cast, 10/10, was made in 1995 for the Broad Art
    Museum (then the Kresge) at Michigan State University - their archives
    includes a letter written by Catlett describing the later casting in Mexcio.
    The original plaster figure is visible in the 1980 photographs of Catlett's
    studio that illustrate Lewis's monograph. Casts of <i>Pensive</i> are in the

    important Detroit artist to come to auction. Beginning in 1947, Charles
    McGee was attending art classes part time at the Society of Arts and Crafts
    in Detroit (now the College for Creative Studies). In 1951, he studied oil
    painting with the director Sarkis Sarkisian and was a classmate of Hughie
    Lee-Smith. From this early, academic beginning, McGee's work evolved into
    the large, vibrant and multimedia constructions that he is known for today.
    His works are now in many museum collections, including the Detroit
    Institute of Arts, Howard University and Clark Atlanta University. In 2009,
    Dr. Julia R. Myers curated the first major retrospective of his work with
    the exhibition and catalogue <i>Energy, Charles McGee at Eighty-Five</i> at
    Eastern Michigan University. The artist recently passed away on February 4th
    of this year. Myers pp. 6-7.

    urban abstraction by Charles Alston is an important painting, an outstanding
    and scarce example of a large modernist canvas. Alston's vision is rooted in
    his earlier urban nocturnes of the late 1940s, <i>Harlem at Night</i>, 1948
    and <i>Untitled (New York Cityscape)</i>, circa 1948. Both Alston and Norman
    Lewis shared a new vision of fragmented urban life against a dark,
    atmospheric ground. By 1950, Alston had transitioned completely into
    abstraction, and his <i>Untitled</i>, oil on canvas, 1950, entered in the
    national juried competition, <i>America Painting Today</i>, was acquired by
    the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1951.<br><br>While it was dated 1948 in
    the Studio Museum exhibition, this large canvas, with its loaded and broad
    brushstrokes appears closer in date to 1960. His 1962 solo exhibition at
    Dunbarton Galleries in Boston featured <i>Tenements</i>, a very similar
    40x50 inch oil painting, illustrated on the cover of the brochure. By 1960,
    Alston was painting and exhibiting compostitions inspired by the urban
    environment seen from his Harlem at night for inspiration - including
    paintings like <i>Across the River</i>, 1959.  His exhbition at Kenekeleba
    Gallery included other similar paintings like <i>Nocturne (Across the Hudson
    River)</i>, 1964 and <i>Tenements</i> again, now titled <i>Demolition</i>
    and not dated. Jennings pp. 23 and 62.

    Hooks was among the most significant Black ceramic artists of the 20th
    Century and the founder of Studio A, one of the country's first Black owned
    and operated fine arts galleries in Gary, Indiana. Born August 2, 1927 in
    Baltimore, Earl Hooks received a BA degree from Howard University in 1949,
    attended Catholic University in Washington, DC from 1949-51 and then
    received graduate certificates from both Rochester Institute of Technology
    in 1954 and the School of American Craftsman in New York in ceramics in
    1955. He served as both professor and chair of the art department at Fisk
    University from 1961-67.<br><br>Hooks gained recognition for his use of
    monochromatic forms that maximized the inherent properties of his materials
    - creating his quiet and somber sculptural works. Artist and art historian
    Amalia Amaki has described Hooks as "committed to portrayals related to the
    African American experience and creative techniques that emphasized his keen
    understanding of the relationships between balance, light, harmony and
    space."

    dashing, experimental canvas, and one of the earliest abstract paintings by
    Sam Gilliam to come to auction. This intriguing painting dates from
    Gilliam's first period of experimentation in color field painting from
    1966-1968 with his earliest staining of raw canvas and use of improvisation.
    With a similar ethereal atmosphere of blurred earthy colors, <i>Toyopet
    I</i> is painting appears closely related to Gilliam's <i>Light Fan</i>,
    1966, in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington,
    DC. Other similar, small color field paintings from this 1966 period include
    <i>So They Can</i> and <i>Autumn Points</i>; each share an gauzy organic
    flow of bands of verdant color. Then Gilliam revisited the stained canvas in
    1997, adding daring dashes of more vibrant color, suspended in layers of
    acrylic medium. Binstock p. 163.

    Hale Woodruff's retrospective was a celebration of his retirement from New
    York University as a Professor Emeritus that year.<br><br>This large canvas
    is an excellent example of Hale Woodruff's postwar painting in which he
    describes landscape and natural phenomena within the idiom of Abstract
    Expressionism. This significant and striking canvas shows Woodruff's
    continued evolution as an abstract painter through the 1960s. In addition to
    continuing his <i>Celestial Gate</i> series, Woodruff now creates some of
    his most abstract painting with his landscapes. Woodruff's landscape is a
    beautiful, modernist composition - bold, horizontal strokes define layers
    between bands of both earthy and jewel-like colors. Another canvas from
    1967, Woodruff's <i>Figure</i>, is in the collection of the Metropolitan
    Museum of Art, New York.

    collection (1972);  the estate of Allan O. Hunter, Jr., acquired at Swann
    Galleries, October 8, 2019.<br><br><i>Girl in a Garden</i> is an exquisitely
    layered example of Romare Bearden's mid-career collage. The figure is
    comprised of a now familiar Bearden photomontage of African masks, in
    contrast with the textures and color of the rest of the composition. Bearden
    created faces using cut images of African masks and sculptures from
    magazines and exhibition catalogues beginning with his first series of
    collages in 1964. According to Helen Shannon in her 2007 essay "African Art
    and Cubism, Proto-Collage and Collage in the Work of Romare Bearden,"
    Bearden used African sculpture as an aesthetic source even earlier in his
    1940s paintings. Like his 1940s, quasi-cubist paintings, Bearden returned to
    African sources for large figure compositions again in the late
    1960s.<br><br>This collage shows Bearden's integration of all types of his
    collage medium--patterned paper, fabric, handcolored paper, and distressed
    solid colored papers. Bearden also introduced surface abrasion as early as
    1968, with more solid areas of color and less collage photographic images,
    and added fabric into his collage with works like <i>She-BA</i>, 1970,
    <i>Patchwork Quilt</i>, 1970, and <i>Conjunction</i>, 1971. In <i>Girl in a
    Garden</i>, Bearden deftly balances a composition of rectangular areas of
    color that emphasize the two-dimensional surface; with this spatial
    flatness, Bearden references both the history of Dutch and ancient Chinese
    painting, with an awareness of contemporary abstraction.<br><br>Bearden has
    created a new type of icon with these masked or conjure figures,
    mythological African Americans born of the Diaspora and the New World.
    Bearden continued to explore the subject of myth in his heroic
    <i>Odysseus</i> series that he began this same year. Tweedy p. 22.

    racial and police violence in the aftermath of a civil rights protest, and
    the seven years he spent on a Georgia chain gang. His paintings have been
    exhibited at museums and galleries around the country, including the Yale
    University Art Gallery, the Hudson River Museum, and The Adelson Galleries
    in New York. In 2011 Rembert was the subject of an award-winning documentary

    Tempera, gouache, postcards, punched paper, nails, flourescent paint,
    glitter and thread on board, 1980-81. Approximately 330x560 mm; 13x22
    inches; 668x412x102 mm; 26¼x16¼x4 inches (including Plexiglass box). Signed
    and dated "1980-81" in pencil, lower right on the mount.<br><br>Provenance:
    private collection, Los Angeles (1981); thence by descent, private
    collection, New York.<br><br>Exhibited: Lerner-Heller Gallery, New York,
    1981, with the gallery label on the frame back.<br><br>Born in Philadelphia,
    Howardena Pindell pursued her passion in art from a young age, with
    extensive lessons in fine art. She received a BFA from Boston University in
    1965, and an MFA from Yale University in 1967. Pindell moved to New York,
    and began working in the Art's Education Department at the Museum of Modern
    Art. Howardena Pindell first engaged with hole-punched circles by counting
    and numbering each one, then placed them over a gridded form — often the
    lines of graph paper — and added embellishments such as acrylic, watercolor,
    glitter, and even baby powder.<br><br>Pindell's affinity with numbers and
    grids grew from the influence of her father — a mathematician who often
    wrote down figures in a gridded journal. In 1972, Pindell was one of 22
    co-founders of the A.I.R. Gallery in New York, which was the first
    artist-directed gallery for women artists in the United States. By 1977, she
    was appointed associate curator in the Prints and Drawings Department at
    MoMA.<br><br>In 1979, just when she was beginning the next phase of her
    career as a professor of art at SUNY, Stony Brook, Pindell was injured in a
    serious car accident that left her with acute memory loss. Her subsequent
    1980-81 <i>Oval Memory</i> series transformed postcards saved from her
    global travels into elaborate assemblages that helped reconstruct her
    memories.<br><br> This beautiful example of the Howardena Pindell's <i>Oval
    Memory Series</i> assemblage is the first of this important series to come
    to auction. Her <i>Autobiography: Oval Memory #1</i> is in the collection of
    the artist; <i>Oval Memory Series II: Castle Dragon.</i> is in the
    collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

  CROSSHEAD: Untitled.
  year: '1976'
  TYPESET: >-
    Pencil on cream wove paper, 1976, 610x457 mm; 24x18 inches. Initialed
    "W.W.Y." and dated in pencil, lower right.<br><br>Provenance: acquired
    directly from the artist; property from the Willie Young Collection LP, a
    partnership managed by the Louis-Dreyfus Family.<br><br>Over a remarkable
    six-decade career, working exclusively in graphite on paper, Willie Wayne
    Young has created an impressive body of work centered around his love of
    drawing. He has investigated the infinite possibilities found in the
    abstraction of organic forms and imaginary landscapes. One can immediately
    see how deliberately and delicately considered these artworks are. Young
    draws with a pocketknife sharpened pencil and often a magnifying
    glass.<br><br>Largely a self-taught artist, the Dallas native's talent was
    first noticed as a teenager when Young participated in local artist Chapman
    Kelley's studio group from 1959 until 1963. Living and working in Dallas his
    entire life, Young did not receive national attention until his first solo
    exhibition in 1993 at the Ricco/Maresca Gallery of New York, followed by
    another solo show in 1994 at the Goldie Paley Gallery at Moore College of
    Art and Design in Philadelphia. Young's drawings soon were included by
    curators in several institutional exhibitions; including the 1995 <i>A World
    of Their Own: Twentieth Century American Folk Art</i> at the Newark Museum,
    and the 1996 <i>A Labor of Love</i> curated by Marcia Tucker at the New
    Museum of Contemporary Art, New York. In 2009, the African American Museum
    of Dallas gave Young his first retrospective, curated by Edleeca Thompson,
    <i>The Visionary Art of Willie Young</i>. Then more recently, in 2015
    Young's work was included in <i>Inside the Outside: Five Self-Taught Artists
    from the William Louis-Dreyfus Foundation</i> at the Katonah Museum of Art,
    New York, a nationally traveling exhibition.

    home on the Caribbean island of St. Martin. The role of the Obeah is a
    well-known part of Afro-Caribbean communities and cultural history -
    typically, a woman who practices spiritual, herbal and mystical healing in

    in abstraction in paint and collage. Wimberley studied art with James
    Porter, Loïs Mailou Jones, and James Wells at Howard University. While a
    student, he also played jazz and later developed friendships with musicians
    such as Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, and Ron Carter in New York, who also
    informed his creative sensibility.  He received the Pollack/Kranser
    fellowship in 1998. Wimberley had a solo exhibition at Spanierman Gallery,
    East Hampton, NY in 2008, and has had recent solo exhibitions at the Islip
    Art Museum, June Kelly Gallery, New York and Heckscher Museum, Huntington,
    NY. His works are found in the permanent collections of the Parrish Art
    Museum, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and the Yale
    University Art Gallery.

    Weems focuses on the cultural emphasis that has been placed on African
    Americans' skin color and the divisions it causes. This idea is further
    developed with Weems' use of a bright yellow tone - it highlights how our
    perceptions of color and race are conditioned by artificial standards. The
    artist printed another edition of 5 in 1997.

    takes a medium typically relegated to young children's entertainment, and
    writes of a "soon-to-be emancipated 19th century Negress." What begins as a
    seemingly hopeful tale of a free life written in the mode of a fairy tale,
    Walker's prose quickly mimics her dark and provocative imagery, detailing
    the racial and sexual horrors that awaited a young African-American woman in
    the 19th century.

    to earn a BFA from the California College of Arts & Crafts where she
    specialized in metallurgy. In 1967, Montgomery began working as an
    independent curator - throughout her career, she has organized more than 150
    exhibitions in museums, university galleries, and art centers. She served as
    the curator for the Rainbow Sign Gallery in Berkeley, California. Later, as
    Black Arts Consultant for the Oakland Museum, she was responsible for
    curating a major retrospective of the work of Sargent Johnson as well as an
    exhibition entitled, <i>California Black Craftsmen</i>. In addition, she
    lent her expertise in helping the museum develop a collection of African
    American art.  Between 1976 and 1979, she served as the San Francisco Art
    Commissioner. She moved to Washington D.C. in 1980 to pursue a career with

    inches.<br><br>Provenance: private collection, New Jersey.<br><br>Victor
    Davson was born in Georgetown, Guyana and received a BFA degree from Pratt
    Institute (1980), Brooklyn, New York. He was the co-founder of Aljira, a
    Center for Contemporary Art, with artist Carl  E. Hazlewood in Newark, NJ,
    in 1983, and served as its founding director until 2016. Davson's thinking
    is heavily influenced by the anti-colonial politics of the Caribbean and the
    intellectuals of that period. These include writers and activists like Aimé
    Césaire, Martin Carter, Frantz Fanon and Walter Rodney. Since 1996, his
    series of paintings, <i>Bad Cow Comin'</i> is his attempt to negotiate the
    roots of identity in a terrain of loss and desire - it is a response to
    strong memories from his childhood in Guyana of performances in which men
    masqueraded from house to house on Christmas Day. These carnivalesque
    characters serve as metaphors for the people of the African Diaspora who
    survived transatlantic slavery because of their resiliency.<br><br>“The
    visual and the performative in the Caribbean are explicitly linked; the
    brilliance and innovation of the costumes are tied to the music and the
    meaning of the performance. Masking traditions embody both the colonizer and
    the colonized. In them we witness both “civilized” European and “savage”
    African religious expressions; the maintenance of the status quo, and the
    opposition to it that is expressed in ritual defiance. There is menace in
    the air, and there is exuberance. Davson can still hear the pitch and rattle
    of the kettle drum in his head.” —Belinda Edmondson Ph.D.

    Art Studios, Notre Dame Center for Arts & Cuture, with the blind stamp lower
    right.<br><br>Another impression is in the permanent collection of the
    Minneapolis Institute of Art, Minnesota.<br><br>Beverly McIver depicts
    herself here in blackface make-up, standing alone in an ambiguous setting,
    gazing pensively at the viewer. Dressed in a maid’s uniform (her mother was
    a domestic worker), she wears a clown’s wig and white gloves, cradling a
    pair of black-skinned dolls in her arm. Her shoes and socks are those of a
    child. On the wall behind her hangs a portrait of a grinning circus clown.
    The scene recounts a recurring dream from McIver’s childhood. She explained:
    “As a child, I had dreamed of becoming a clown to escape my black skin,
    poverty, and the housing project I once called home. In high school, she was
    a pre-professional clown and considered attending clown college. She says it
    was her "liberation.” For McIver, the self-portrait is a journey in
    self-revelation in which she confronts black stereotypes while seeking her
    own identity as a woman and an African American.
