  DESCRIPT: RAPHAEL T. ROUSSEL (1883-1967)
  CROSSHEAD: TO AUSTRALIA / P&O / ONE CLASS SERVICE.
  TYPESET: >-
    Raphael, son of the French painter Theodore Roussel, designed posters for
    the British steamship lines P&O and RSMP promoting travel to such foreign
    destinations as Australia and Sudan. He also designed dioramas for the
    British Empire Exhibition in 1926. "Another avenue for poster artists was
    the desire, on behalf of both the Commonwealth of Australia and the shipping
    lines, to lure immigrants to Australia. [Roussel's poster] is a classic
    image with a lightly tanned farmer beckoning Britons to a land bathed in
    sunshine" (Trading Places p. 4). Trading Places p. 5.

  DESCRIPT: RHYS WILLIAMS (1894-1976)
  CROSSHEAD: QANTAS EMPIRE AIRWAYS. Circa 1938.
  TYPESET: >-
    Primarily known as a landscape painter, Williams was also an illustrator,
    engraver and commercial artist. He designed a small handful of posters, most
    notably for Qantas and the P & O shipping line. Qantas Empire Airways came
    into being in 1934, the result of a merger between Britain's Imperial
    Airways and Qantas. It operated until 1947 when the company was purchased by
    the government, and it became Australia's flagship airline. The incredible
    aircraft pictured on this poster does not seem to have ever existed and was
    most likely the artist's rendition of a futuristic vessel, in keeping with
    the slogan of the poster, "Out of a Great Past a Greater Future."

  TYPESET: >-
    Australian-born Rogers studied art in his native Sydney before moving to

    The Maharaja began merely as a rich Indian potentate, symbolizing
    graciousness and high living. And somewhere along the line his creators gave
    him a distinctive personality, his outsized moustache, the striped turban
    and his aquiline nose . . . Air-India calls him the Maharaja for want of a
    better description. But his blood isn't blue. He may look like royalty, but
    he isn't royal . . . Today, this naughty, diminutive Maharaja of Air-India
    has become a world figure. He can be a lover boy in Paris, a sumo wrestler

    sought after of his travel poster work is this geometrically inspired image
    of zebras grazing in tall African grass. Almost abstract in the interplay
    between the zebras' stripes and the stalks of grass, this image has a

    BOEING 747 / THE GIANT JET IN THE SERVICE OF EL AL ISRAEL AIRLINES. Circa
    1971.
  TYPESET: >-
    El Al began flying Boeing 747s in 1971 and they were used for the New York /
    Tel Aviv route. The new planes were nearly twice as big as any existing
    aircraft in the company's fleet. For the next 48 years the Israeli Airline
    operated 20 different aircraft from the 747 series. The last flight for the
    jumbo jet in service of the airline took place from Rome to Jerusalem in
    2019. Here, an anonymous artist introduces the waning days of the
    psychedelic era to the new frontier of jumbo jet air service.  Rare. We were
    able to locate only one other copy, in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum,
    inventory number A19960170000.

    Al-Droubi designed at least four other posters published for the "Republic

    multiple languages and depicts sites for visitors to see in the city and
    around the country. This rare image, a fifth poster by the artist, is
    previously unrecorded and does not appear in the Qatar National Library
    database. This row of modernist buildings is in Tahrir Square, in the Bab
    Al-Sharqi neighborhood. This area of central Baghdad is located on the east
    bank of the Tigris River, right at the Al Jumariyah (Republic) Bridge. While
    the 1960s brought some significant cultural and economic growth in the
    establishment of theaters, hospitals, libraries, and a stadium, Iraq
    suffered from waves of political upheaval and war between moments of
    stability. In the decades that followed, sadly, this market was the site of
    many tragedies, including routine bombing attacks.

  TYPESET: >-
    Rather ironically, the "State Joint Stock Company for Foreign Tourists,"
    (Intourist, the Soviet State Travel agency) was formed in April 1929, just
    six months prior to the stock market crash that plunged the Western world
    into the Great Depression. "As Socialist Realism was gradually taking over
    and the era of the avant-garde was coming to an end, there were no official
    guidelines on the Intourist style, and in the first two or three years it
    was still up to the artists and the Committee to decide how to address the
    discriminating Western audience" (Intourist p. 17). "The impulse of the
    avant-garde . . . is still evident in the early publications of Intourist
    artists, who struggled to identify a vivid and contemporary visual language
    appropriate for export without being too inappropriate for the country it
    was imported from. The influence of Rodchenko and Constructivist stylistic
    devices is evident [in some early Intourist posters], while Lissitsky
    appears again in the image of the 'Trans-Siberian Express' . . . [these]
    early posters created an adventurous and attractive reality, overall charged
    with energy and enthusiasm" (Intourist p. 18). The Trans-Siberian railway
    cut the travel time between Europe and the Far East by more than half. A
    trip that would take as long as 36 days by steamship could be accomplished
    in 12 days by rail. Rare. Intourist  pl. 2.

    clients. Van der Laan's posters reflect his versatility with the airbrush
    and an affinity for transportation in the Machine Age. This poster was
    issued upon the opening of the Ypenburg Airport in 1936. The airfield is
    delineated by the enormous shadow of an aircraft flying overhead. The poster
    also depicts the Functionalist style terminal, designed by Brinkman & Van
    der Vlugt who, among other projects, also designed the Van Nelle factory.
    The terminal had a restaurant, a roof terrace and a grandstand from which

    The Vosges mountains were never as popular as the Alps for winter sports;

  TYPESET: >-
    In this, one of his earliest travel posters, Broders masterfully employs his
    signature use of depth of field, with the vegetation and people in the
    foreground and the route from Nice to Geneva in the background. His
    depiction of the people touring the Alps by motor coach is straightforward
    and illustrative, bearing none of the Art Deco stylization that became his
    hallmark in his works from later in the decade. Broders p. 66, Perry /

    This image, evoking the stylish, languid reminiscences of an F. Scott
    Fitzgerald story, is an uncanny example of art imitating life, imitating
    art. Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, stayed in this Riviera town in 1926,
    and it was during his time there that he began writing his novel Tender is
    the Night. The stylistic rendering of the main figures is too sophisticated
    to have been early in Broders' career. A visual chronology of Broders' works
    shows that he began to master the use of diffident characters with elongated
    bodies in 1928. Broders p. 91, Riviera 60, La Mer p. 116, Azur 144, Perry /

    One of his most popular posters during his lifetime, it was widely used by

    More than just the joyful expression of an enthusiastic young woman greeting
    the day and embracing the climate on the Cote d'Azur, this poster has been
    cited as a classic example of shifting social mores, as well as a shift in
    the design of travel posters themselves. Here, the traditional "aristocratic
    or upper middle-class woman in a long crinoline dress who is carrying an
    umbrella in hand to protect herself from the sun [who was depicted in many
    turn-of-the-century travel posters], gives way to a young, buxom sun

    Domergue dedicated his working life to the elegant quotidian worlds of
    French society. Dividing his time between Paris, Deauville and the Riviera,
    he designed works for performers and fashion balls. This is one of a
    seasonal pair of images promoting the chic, Monaco destination that "sought
    to conjure up reverie, magic, luxury . . . with their slender, elegant
    ladies and graceful compositions (Azur p. 184). His L'Été á Monte-Carlo
    poster depicts two bathing beauties with the caption, "The most beautiful
    women in the world." Here, a lithe and fashionable couple promenade by the
    Monte-Carlo Bay on their way "to a gala evening on a night when the stars
    merge with the lights of the city and their reflections in the sea" (ibid).
    The text, which doesn't appear on all the variations of this poster, almost
    unnecessarily explains that the chic people winter down on the Cote d'Azur.

    the Riviera, they also spend their winters there. Azur 211, Riviera 101.

    In one of the classic railroad images to emerge from the Art Deco era,
    Fix-Masseau uses the triangle of the station roof, the circle and rectangle
    at the front of the train and the squares on the platform to create a
    powerful geometric image. Most often compared to Cassandre's Nord Express in
    its use of perspective, Fix-Masseau captures an entirely different element
    of train travel than is featured in Cassandre's romanticized image -
    punctuality. Using warm colors and a prominent display of the station clock
    as the train pulls in, the artist emphasizes his message - written across
    the top of the poster in a typeface that is as streamlined as the design of
    the train itself. Modern Poster 171, Weill 382, Art Deco p. 63, Affiche Art

  CROSSHEAD: ÉTOILE DU NORD. 1927.
  TYPESET: >-
    L'Étoile du Nord was an absolute revolution in advertising when it first
    appeared in 1927. Although advertising a Pullman train, it was startlingly
    new to have a travel poster that depicted no landscape, no destination, and
    no train. The pure and powerful image is a tribute to the dramatic use of
    perspective, with the train represented metaphorically by the star dancing
    on the horizon where many rails converge in the distance. To keep the image
    as clean and unobstructed as possible, Cassandre corrals the typography at
    the very bottom of the composition and then organizes it in a neat and
    structured frame around the border. Here, he also develops one of his
    signature design elements: viewing an object from a low angle to make it
    seem larger than life and more impressive, a technique he perfected in his
    1935 poster for the Normandie. Through his association with Maurice Moyrand,
    who was the agent for the printer L. Danel, (and with whom he would form the
    Alliance Graphique in 1930), Cassandre was commissioned to create two
    posters for the Chemins de fer du Nord in 1927. Mouron pl. 11, Cassandre /

    In 1926, he was one of five artists contracted to work exclusively for the
    LNER; the others were Tom Purvis, Austin Cooper, Frank Mason and Fred
    Taylor. The contract lasted for three years. Adept at depicting both
    architecture and people, Newbould composed his colorful posters with a
    strong graphic eye. He designed several posters promoting travel to the
    continent, including images for Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Nuremberg and The
    Belgian Coast. Here, he captures a wonderful snippet of Berlin street life,
    in which elegant couples stroll down the boulevard, gentlemen enjoy the
    cafes, and automobiles and distinguished buildings line the avenue. Running
    through the center of Berlin, "Unter den Linden" was one of the grandest

    Western Railway, Southern Railway, and the London Underground, some of which
    are in the collection of the National Railway Museum in York. This rare

    Bard's birthplace of Stratford-Upon-Avon. This quaint and idyllic street
    scene, with fashionable strolling figures, also includes an interesting
    detail - there is a prominently displayed American flag billowing overhead. 
    This flag marks Harvard House, built in 1596 by John Harvard’s grandfather
    (Thomas Rogers), and owned by Harvard University since the early 20th

  CROSSHEAD: EAST COAST JOYS / TRAVEL BY L.N.E.R. Set of 6 posters. 1931.
  TYPESET: >-
    Purvis' work for the British Railroads was exclusively for the LNER. Many of
    his posters for the railway promoted travel to the East Coast, depicting
    swimmers, sailors, beaches, beachgoers, children and hikers. This was the
    first of two series he designed, the other circa 1936, which presented six
    individual images that could be used on their own or as a set. When viewed
    side by side they form a continuous, panoramic strip of coastline. This
    effect is one Purvis borrowed from the Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblock print
    artists, specifically Utagawa Sadahide, "whose work was commonly constructed
    from multiple separate sheets" (Purvis p. 76). "Purvis is an artist of
    unusual versatility and technical range. He designs posters which are
    simplified patterns . . . bold impressions in which solid shadows only are
    left to 'tell the story' ; he works in 'woodcut' technique . . . In all his
    work there is personality, knowledge and vigor (Commercial Art, 1927, p.
    151). This is a rare graphic masterwork; we could locate only one other full

  CROSSHEAD: LNER / TAKE ME BY THE FLYING SCOTSMAN. Circa 1936.
  TYPESET: >-
    In 1936, the Southern Railway came up with a photographically-inspired
    poster of a young boy on a train platform talking to the driver of the train
    far above the platform in the cab of the locomotive. That endearing image
    was printed in different languages and quickly became ubiquitous, entering
    the national visual vocabulary of Great Britain. In this unofficial Art Deco
    spin-off, Thomson presents the locomotive in a manner much more in keeping
    with the designs of A.M. Cassandre. In a humorous twist, the driver needs to
    speak to the tiny child far below on the platform using a megaphone. Railway

    Moholy-Nagy left Germany in 1935 and spent two years in London before
    settling in Chicago. In London, he found employment doing artwork for a
    men's clothing store and producing publicity material for Imperial Airways.
    He is credited with designing both a brochure and this poster map for the
    airline in 1936, each of which was unsigned. This world map is Moholy-Nagy's
    tribute to Henry Beck's recently designed and published London Tube Map
    (1933). "The Tube Map imports the aesthetics of Eastern and Middle European
    avant-gardes, including Constructivism and the Bauhaus . . . In this
    context, Moholy-Nagy designed a world network map for the Imperial Airways
    airline that transferred Beck's topological aesthetics to the connections of
    world air traffic while juxtaposing a diagram and a map view" (Amodern.net).

    Pat Keely established himself as a prominent graphic designer in the years
    before the Second World War, known for his strong, stylized Art Deco
    aesthetic (which he used most notably in his posters for the Southern
    Railway). During World War II, he was one of the artists chosen to
    participate in the workplace safety series commissioned by the Royal Society
    for the Prevention of Accidents. To promote the shipping facilities in
    Southampton, this masterful, modernist image of a ship and a derrick eschews
    outlining and uses bold geometric shapes.

    Megantic, then one of the Big Four (Celtic, Cedric, Baltic, Adriatic). The
    Arabic III is on the top right, and finally, on the lower right, is the 
    Albertic. There has been a lot of confusion as to the date of this poster,
    but as the Albertic only joined the White Star Fleet in 1927, the poster
    must have been produced after that year.

    Rather than advertising a cruise to the New World, the poster is in fact
    promoting cruises from New York to the West Indies. Likely, the German

    hung down in front of the shoulders) and Wesekh (the broad neck piece).

    artistic legacy is filled with magazine covers, posters, calendars and tide
    tables. "His work for the ocean liner industry was prodigious and his images
    graced the posters of more than sixty-five companies" (Rodmell p. 20). These
    included Canadian Pacific, French Line, Swedish Lloyd, Shaw-Saville and
    Albion Line, General Steam Navigation Co., Royal Holland Lloyd, and
    Norddeutscher Lloyd Bremen. The Innisfallen was built in Belfast by the

    of design, helped him gain commissions in both France and Japan. Here, he
    depicts the Nippon Yusen Kaisha Line's Chichibu Maru, which had its maiden
    voyage in 1930 and primarily made the crossing between Yokohama and San
    Francisco. Commandeered by the Japanese government during the war, the
    vessel was sunk while serving as a troopship in 1943. Its speed and

  CROSSHEAD: AEROPUT JUGOSLAVIJA. Circa 1931.
  TYPESET: >-
    Founded in 1927, Aeroput was the national airline of the Kingdom of
    Yugoslavia.  Here, a de Havilland DH.80A Puss Moth monoplane flies through a
    daytime sky, while on the opposite side of the poster a train travels along
    the same route by night. The message, and the effect, is literally "Earth
    roads are tiring, air ways are resting." In other words, spend a comfortable
    day traveling by air, and not an uncomfortable night, or longer, traveling
    by train. The call numbers on the side of the aircraft UN SAA indicate that
    it was introduced into the Aeroput fleet in 1931. The small plane could sit
    three people and was used as an air taxi. "Hans Wagula gave up painting as a
    profession about 1924 and devoted himself exclusively to advertising art and
    to the poster in particular . . . Today [he is] not only the best-known
    poster artist in the Ostmark, he is also the most notable exponent of that
    pure and classic German poster style which finds characteristic expression
    in simplicity, clarity and monumentality of form and which alone does
    justice to the nature of the work in hand" (Gebrauchsgraphik 1941, vol 11,
    p. 7 & 16). "His brilliantly composed landscape-placards are evidence of a
    carefully considered command of space that becomes almost a law in itself,
    as also of a special preference for strong, unbroken, yet always delicately
    intershading colors, whose delightful power of brightness rejoices the
    beholder's eye without ever offending his harmonious color-sensitivity"
    (ibid, 1936 vol 4, p. 3). This is the Serbian version. Crouse p. 25.

    Van Heusden never formally studied art but did have illustrations published
    while he attended business school. In 1945, after a stint working with a
    painter, he found himself employed in the advertising department of K.L.M.
    In 1948, van Heusden designed a poster that featured a large KLM travel bag
    being carried by a disembodied arm; it was a much-awarded image within The
    Netherlands. Playing off that success, this image presents a KLM bag placed
    amongst other luggage beneath a wall adorned with travel posters. As with a
    number of his other posters, this image "does not have a selling function in
    the strict sense of the word, but is primarily intended to support the
    general brand advertising of KLM abroad;" it is a world-traveler's dream
    (Ariadne, November 1, 1948, p. 326).

    forever without ever making port, and whose sighting is considered a portent

    advertising. And yet, KLM used the ancient myth as part of their promotion

    in other aspects of their corporate identity, from brochures to typefaces.
    This series, one of several designed by Rogers for Qantas appeared as early

    called the Burlington Zephyr, it was given the name Pioneer as other engines
    were put into service. Prior to its inaugural run, on November 11, 1934, the
    train went on exhibition around the country. The train made its first stop
    for one day in Philly, then it toured Eastern and Midwestern cities. It then
    went from Denver to Chicago to help inaugurate the second year opening of
    the World's Fair Century of Progress. Following that, it toured the Western
    states, which included the publicized stop here in San Francisco, then
    finally back to the Fair to be exhibited. The Chicago Tribune wrote, "the

  TYPESET: >-
    Working out of Northern California, Maurice Logan was a prominent commercial
    and fine artist. In 1917 joined five other California painters to form the
    "Society of Six," a group of artists whose work was categorized first and
    foremost by bold colors. "Considered outsiders in their time, their work is
    now recognized as part of the vital and enduring lineage of American art"
    (Society of Six). In 1923, Maurice Logan began designing posters for the
    Southern Pacific Railway. For these earliest images, "he used the flat color
    effects of the German poster technique, painting with bold colors and
    relying on color contrast for depth. The series depicted women in emblematic
    settings" (Zega p. 58). These early Southern Pacific posters, with their
    broad, flat planes of color and absence of outlining, are reminiscent of
    work by Ludwig Hohlwein. Later in the decade, as Logan continued his work
    with the railroad, his posters became less graphic and more painterly. Zega

    waters. The tranquil Gem of the Cascades is set in a dormant volcano called
    Mount Mazama, one in the chain of volcanoes that includes Mount St. Helens.
    Mount Mazama's eruption about 5700 B.C. catapulted volcanic ash miles into
    the sky and expelled so much pumice and ash that the summit soon collapsed,
    creating a huge, smoldering caldera. Eventually, rain and snowmelt
    accumulated in the caldera, forming a lake more than 1,900 feet deep, the
    deepest lake in the United States"

    America’s most distinctive and truly cosmopolitan cities - San Francisco and
    New Orleans. Old Spain’s influence still lives along this route that runs
    close to Mexico. A one-day side trip over the Apache Trail highway of
    Arizona is a delightful break in the journey, as is the visit to the
    Carlsbad Caverns from El Paso. At New Orleans, after an interesting journey
    through the romantic South, the traveler may continue east or north by train
    or board a Southern Pacific steamship and reach New York after '100 Golden
    Hours at Sea.'" In this effective pastiche image, Kady incorporates the
    train pulling out of its terminus in the West and the sea route to New York
    City.

    in the 1930s, on the Bahia Bacochibampo in Guaymas. A period brochure
    stated, "Playa de Cortes is unique not only in that it is America's newest
    foreign playground, but also in that it is located in one of America's
    closest foreign playgrounds. In fact, it is not much farther away than many
    of the resorts in the United States . . . yet you are in a foreign country.
    It is easy to get there because of convenient rail service. It is reached
    from Tucson on the route of the Southern Pacific's famous Sunset Limited
    (New Orleans - Los Angeles- San Francisco) and the crack Golden State
    Limited (Chicago-Los Angeles). From Tucson it is only part of a day and a
    night to Playa de Cortes by air-conditioned Pullman on Southern Pacific's
    West Coast of Mexico Route." Born in Guadalajara, Gonzalez moved to San
    Francisco in 1927. He studied at the California School of Fine Art and
    became a painter, illustrator, commercial graphic designer, muralist and
    ultimately an art professor at San Francisco City College. He worked for The

    1920, he was hired by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company to

    of the advertising appeared in brochures, magazines and newspapers, but
    local advertisements were in the form of billboards and hand-painted posters
    that appeared in department stores, banks, displays in windows and bulletin

    "streamlined trains were among the most striking, visible and accessible
    examples of Modernism" in America (Zega p. 104). "The streamliner was
    perfectly suited to the poster medium; its smooth airflow profile offered
    the prospect of a respite from America's stylistic preoccupation with

    Southern Pacific began operating its streamlined train service, Daylight,

    trains were frequently referred to as "the most beautiful trains in the
    world") that by 1940 they were running twice a day. The Morning Daylight and
    the Noon Daylight. It wasn't until the middle of 1938 that Southern Pacific
    began offering their $6 one-way fare. Initially it had cost $9.47 for the
    same ticket, but the railroad had to lower the price in the face of

    In the 1930s, "streamlined trains were among the most striking, visible and
    accessible examples of Modernism" in America (Zega p. 104). "The streamliner
    was perfectly suited to the poster medium; its smooth airflow profile
    offered the prospect of a respite from America's stylistic preoccupation
    with realism" (ibid). The GS-2 locomotive (pictured here) was put into
    service in 1937; it was the first of its kind to bear the iconic red and
    orange color scheme. Trains, pulling 12 Pullman-Standard cars each, would
    leave Los Angeles and San Francisco at 8:15am every morning and arrive at
    their destinations simultaneously at 6pm. Pictured is engine #4410, the

    Before the National Parks Service was established in 1916, several large
    railway companies had already formed a "Bureau of Service to National Parks
    and Resorts." Their trains had been servicing the areas for years and many
    had already established infrastructure, such as lodges and other public
    facilities. The Union Pacific Railroad announced its "Circle Loop" in 1922.
    This loop (a 489-mile tour) encompassed the newly established National Parks

  TYPESET: >-
    The California Zephyr, advertised as "the most talked about train in
    America," was built by the Budd Company in 1947 and the train made its very
    first departure between Chicago and Oakland on March 20, 1949. It was the
    first long-distance train to carry vista domes in regular service; it
    included a baggage car, a dining car and sleeping cars, and the car
    hostesses were known as "Zephyrettes." According to Western Pacific
    advertising records, this poster was first used in February 1950. The
    Western Pacific Railroad was purchased by the Union Pacific Railroad in
    1982, thus becoming part of a combined Union Pacific rail system: the Union
    Pacific Railroad, the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and the WP. Although
    Western Pacific was a prolific advertiser in magazines, very few posters for
    the company exist. Rare.

    1968. For the first nine months, the line was serviced by the sleek, General
    Motors Aerotrain, the "all aluminum aeroflyte miracle," (pictured here). The
    train set included nine cars, one of which was the "Chuck Wagon" buffet car
    and another the "Howdy Podner" Bar / Lounge car. The "free buffet meals,"
    were said to be so popular that it helped offset any complaints riders might
    have had. Nine months after it began running, the railroad changed out the

    Streamlined train with conventional streamlined cars.

    Bern Hill was a graphic designer and painter. He "worked for the Kudner

    Motors' Electro-Motive Division embarked on a rather radical advertising
    campaign which included vertical format streamline style paintings for the
    covers of Railway Age" (Vintage Rails, January / February 1998, p. 64).
    Between 1950 and 1956, Hill painted 65 paintings. "Electro-Motive also
    produced a series of very high-grade posters of Hill's paintings that were
    overwritten by the marketing theme for that particular railroad . . . it is
    unknown if all 65 paintings were turned into posters . . . Hill's assignment
    was to portray the 'feel' of each railroad in a scene that often captured
    the landscape of the individual road and gave the viewer the sense of that
    road's missions - freight, passenger or switching" (Railroad Heritage, No.
    6, 2002, p. 10). Here, for the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway, Hill

    Express company, each one an unexpected gem of stylized design. Writing in
    Advertising Outdoors, Best Posters of the Year, 1930, critic Percy Ekhart
    singled the artist out, mentioning that "through his posters for an express
    company, Robert E. Lee has made an impression that has made for a higher
    standard of art in posters" (p. 14). These American Railway Express posters
    were used on company trucks, which had billboards on either side. By some
    accounts, the posters were changed as often as every month. American Railway
    Express came into being during the First World War, when the U.S. Government
    nationalized the country's shipping and freight industries. Although run by
    the government, most of the company was owned by American Express, and its

    unique to Chicago. Here, the Edward Kemeys' sculpted lion on the South side

    The original pedestal lamps, visible here shining yellow in the twilight,
    are no longer in place. "Elmes proves himself to be a refined designer with
    a delicate feeling for continuity and balance in composition. He has a
    sensitive appreciation of colour and a fondness for harmonies in the lower
    keys, while his peculiar ability to see pattern in buildings and trees and

  DESCRIPT: HANSON PUTHUFF (1875-1972)
  CROSSHEAD: THE CHIEF TO CALIFORNIA / CAJON PASS. Circa 1936.
  TYPESET: >-
    Puthuff, born in Missouri, studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and the
    University of Denver Art School before settling in California. He made a
    career as a commercial artist - creating murals, billboards, theater
    advertisements and even museum dioramas for the Los Angeles Museum of
    Natural History. In 1926, he turned entirely toward fine art, exhibiting his
    signature landscape paintings in museums around the country and becoming
    involved in several art clubs and associations
    (http://collections.lacma.org/node/166744). Puthuff counted himself among
    the California Plein-Air Painters, mockingly coined "The Eucalyptus School,"
    creating most of his mountain landscapes on location. Even though he had
    just decided to abandon commercial art, the Santa Fe Railroad commissioned
    him that same year to paint views of the Grand Canyon for advertising. The
    painting featured in this Santa Fe Railroad poster illustrates an
    Impressionistic and atmospheric view of a different landmark, the Cajon Pass
    - the mountains so monumental that the viewer may not even notice the Chief
    train chugging along in the middle ground. Rare. We have found only three
    other instances of this poster at auction.

  TYPESET: >-
    Attempting to encourage citizens to travel to the National Parks, President
    Franklin D. Roosevelt declared 1934 to be National Parks Year. Speaking from
    Glacier National Park on August 5th, 1934, Roosevelt declared "I am glad to
    say that there has been a magnificent response and that the numbers visiting
    our national parks has shown a splendid increase." Posters were prominently
    incorporated into this campaign, as were National Parks Year postage stamps.
    William, along with his brother Kenneth, began working for the Union Pacific
    Railroad in 1930. They designed several works together, which were signed
    "Willmarths," and each did individual work as well.

    a near exact replication of the background of Hans Wagula's Österreich
    (Austria) poster from the 1930s (See Swann sale 2405, Lot 109). The ombre

    "A colorful bird's-eye view of the Theme Center . . . [showing] fairgoers

    Mora was a prominent California artist of Uruguayan heritage who was
    well-known as a cartoonist, painter, cartographer, illustrator, photographer
    and sculptor. In 1998 the Monterey Museum of Art held an exhibition of his
    work, which they described as follows: "Apart from its artistic merits,
    Mora's work is valued for its historical significance. As an astute
    observer, Mora created art that eloquently and accurately described the
    western land and way of life he admired, whether his subject was vaqueros,
    Hopi katsina figures, the Arizona landscape, turn-of-the-century Yosemite,
    or the California missions." This map of San Diego, published by The Marston
    Company in celebration of the city's Golden Anniversary is "characterized by
    exquisite drawing, rich color, and great charm. Mora's maps revealed a deep
    knowledge of Western American history and culture. His maps formed the most
    important collection of pictorial cartography done by any artist of one
    particular region of the United States" (Picturing America, p. 28-9).

    posters, this image of the Boeing 314 Flying Clipper landing in a tropical

    bays throughout the South Pacific. It has been speculated that the view may
    be Tahiti, Pago Pago or Diamond Head, however, the physical characteristics
    depicted do not coincide with the actual geography of any of these islands.
