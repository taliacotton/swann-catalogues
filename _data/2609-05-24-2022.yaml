    been attempted to be made of him. Those partizans of Mr. Birney who, by
    their course at the last Presidential election, contributed, first to the
    annexation of Texas, and, lastly, to a War with Mexico, may feel that their
    conduct needs some defense; but I think they ought to defend themselves, if
    they can, without employing a drunken worthless negro to vilify me."<br>On
    May 13, 1846, Lewis Richardson (b. 1792) delivered a speech at Amherstburg,
    Canada (where slavery was abolished in 1836), after having escaped over 8
    years of enslavement at the Ashland estate of Henry Clay. The speech,
    published in March and April of that year in the Signal of Liberty and other
    abolitionist newspapers, described the abuse and deprivations that
    Richardson suffered at Ashland. Clay denied Richardson's claims, suggesting
    that abolitionists were exploiting the escape to advance their political
    aims.<br>Clay ran as the Whig candidate in the 1844 U.S. presidential
    election, losing to Democrat James K. Polk. Abolitionist and Liberty Party
    candidate James G. Birney also ran in the contest, receiving less than 3% of
    the votes. Clay believed that the attacks of the abolitionists against him
    contributed to his loss, which allowed Polk and his supporters to proceed
    with their program to annex Mexico, which in turn brought about the
    Mexican-American war.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Fischer used descriptive chess notation, which was widely used until the
    1970s, when it was replaced by algebraic notation. The first move in this
    game was Fischer's, who notated "P[awn to]-Q[ueen's k]N[ight ]3"--that is,
    the pawn nearest the knight on the queen's side of the board moves to the
    third square. In algebraic notation, the move is completely and
    unambiguously described by "b3."<br>The heading, "Game for Expressen," was
    written out in unknown hand and refers to the sponsor of this particular
    match, Swedish newspaper Expressen, founded in 1944 and still publishing
    today. In 1970, an analysis of this game was published in the paper, which
    likely obtained the moves from this very sheet.<br>After a game, players
    sometimes sign each other's score sheets to keep as mementos, while some
    competitions require signing one's own sheet before submitting it to
    officials. Presumably, either Fischer wasn't interested in Andersson's
    signature, Andersson delined an invitation to sign, or Fischer was obligated
    to turn in his score sheet after the game.

    perfectly insulated submerged cable. Before the transatlantic triumph of his
    company American Telegraph, Cyrus Field had made some promising attempts in

    Mediterranean Telegraph Company had led to the successful connection of
    Sardinia and Algeria two months after the first transatlantic cable, led by
    the engineers Jacob Brett and Gaetano Bonelli.

    5 October 1943: "Thank you very much for your little book with the subtle
    aphorisms about ethical values. I am convinced that this little work
    deserves publication, since it is suitable for bringing some consolation and
    new courage to live without resorting to the opium of superstition.<br>"What
    I see as a limitation of the little book is that it anxiously averts our
    gaze from the abysses and chasms that are undeniably present in every two-
    and four-legged being and cannot be eliminated by ignoring them. One must
    have the courage to see and understand things in their nakedness in order to
    be a whole person. Spinoza showed that this can be done. Someone would have
    to come who would recreate it in plain, simple language. Maybe you are the
    man."<br>5 October 1950: "You have nicely explained the distinction between
    the ethical act or objective on the one hand and the emotional motive that
    leads to the act or evaluation on the other. The idea itself is of course
    not new. Thus, for example, Kant curiously went so far in the objective
    conception of the ethical that he does not recognize an act as ethically
    valuable if it springs directly from an elementary feeling (e.g. pity); he
    only accepts the sense of duty as the legitimate emotional basis of the
    ethical, something that Schiller already made fun of. In my opinion the
    objective view is the one appropriate to the subject of ethics. The
    emotional situation that prompts the ethical action does not actually belong
    to ethics but to psychology."

    there is a major distinction between the relationship of the Secretary of

    Commerce vis a viz [sic] the Federal Trade Commission in that the latter
    body is a judicial and regulartory [sic] body.<br>"I understand that the

    Hoover exerted the power of his office aggressively, regulating various

    while balancing the interests of business and labor. Although Hoover was
    retained as Secretary of Commerce when Calvin Coolidge became president,
    Coolidge disapproved of regulation, which was reflected in his strongly

    responding to the recommendations she conveys from Bishop [William Hobart]

    whisky, generalizing that Indians are by nature gamblers, acknowledging that
    the present system impoverishes Indians, and proposing that U.S. laws give
    more discretion to Indian executive officers. 2 pages, 4to, "Executive

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    "I . . . notice what you say about Bishop Hare's suggestions as to the
    management of the Indians. I . . . do not doubt his sincere and intelligent
    interest in the Indians; and, yet, I do very much doubt the wisdom of the
    suggestions that the annuities to the Indians should be paid in money. I
    think the first effect would certainly be quite unfavorable, if not
    disastrous. There would be more whisky and fewer blankets. The Indian is a
    great gambler and the possession of money would promote that vice among
    them. In all the patents for allotments it has been thought necessary to
    deprive the Indian of the right of alienation for twenty-five years, upon
    the theory, no doubt generally correct, that the white man would have the
    lands and the Indians nothing in a short time if he was allowed to deal with
    him freely. I fully appreciate the fact that there is much in the present
    Indian system that tends to pauperize. Perhaps the trouble is that our laws
    deal with all Indians on the same plane and do not give the Executive
    officers discretion to deal with each Indian according to his intelligence
    and capabilities."

    manufacturer and merchant . . . .<br>"Your suggestion that trade

    commandeered by the Shipping Board. I find myself in entire agreement with

    alive to the need for ships. . . ."<br>6 May 1918: "A good deal of
    embarrassment and dislocation in the administrative business of the
    Government has been caused by the transfer of clerks and specialists of one
    sort or another form the older and longer established departments to the new
    instrumentalities which have necessarily been created or greatly enlarged
    since this country entered the war . . . . [I]t has often happened that
    employees of the older departments have been drawn away by offers of
    considerable increases of pay . . . sometimes to the serious weakening, of
    the departments . . . ."<br>24 May 1918: "In a talk the other day . . . the
    Chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations . . . suggested the
    desirability of having a proper audit system worked out between the
    Emergency Fleet Corporation and the Treasury Department to cover the
    expenditures of the Corporation. Of course, the Corporation is using its own
    auditors now . . . but it would assist the Committee on Appropriations, and,
    I think, strengthen the whole business with them if the system of audit
    could be coordinated with that of the Treasury . . . ."<br>8 August 1918:

    about communicating plans and specifications for steel, wooden, and concrete
    ships to the governments of the countries with which we are
    associated.<br>". . . I think that as a general principle it is wise to be
    as generous and liberal as we can be without endangering the essential
    interests of the country, and I should assume that it was safe and right to
    let friendly cooperating governments have these plans and specifications
    when they ask for them."<br>9 September 1918: ". . . I am deeply interested
    to learn that Lord Reading purposes [sic] having a conference with you about
    pooling our shipping with the British after the war. That is an
    extraordinary proposition, and I think perhaps it would be wise to tell him
    that we are sure that it will not be possible for us to make special
    arrangements with any one nation . . . ."<br>9 October 1918: ". . . The
    government has been acquiring a great deal of property of one sort or
    another in connection with the prosecution of the war and of the industries
    incident to it, and I am writing to ask if you cannot assign . . . the duty
    of studying the question how that property is to be disposed of to the
    greatest advantage after the war is over . . . ."<br>6 November 1918: "In
    view of the approaching evacuation of Belgium [by retreating German troops]
    and the new problems that confront this unfortunate people, I have asked Mr.
    Hoover to expand the activities of the Commission for Relief in Belgium to
    cover the entire relationship of this government, and possibly that of other

    Lansing: ". . . After our entrance into the war, as you know, American
    shipping was almost wholly withdrawn from the Pacific which left to the
    Japanese nearly a complete monopoly of the carrying trade between the United
    States and the Far East. The rates became exorbitant and American merchants
    complained of discrimination against themselves. . . .<br>"The demand for
    tonnage in the Atlantic of course, is pressing. The starving people of
    Europe must be fed and the material needed for reconstruction work in
    Belgium and France must be supplied, but if the suffering nations of Europe
    can divert a part of their shipping to this effort to recapture control of
    Far Eastern commerce it may . . . protect in a measure our own commercial
    interests in the Orient. . . ."<br>With--Telegram from Counselor of the
    United States Department of State Frank Polk to Robert Lansing, describing
    the problem summarized in Lansing's letter. 1 page, 4to, telegram form.

    while they agree on most matters, his own notion of the "real master" does
    not include those who consider themselves great, since they ignore the
    essential characteristic of a great artist: self-criticism.  With a

    stick to what is natural and seems right to me. I'm not very fond of all
    those artists who consider themselves solemnly great, and act that way;
    examples would be Victor Hugo, [Christian Friedrich] Hebbel, [Stefan]
    George. But the many not-great ones who go along with the pose of the
    Olympian, and I have known many, show me clearly how little good it is when
    an artist--simply because he writes poetry, paints or makes music--counts
    himself among the chosen ones and forgets about self-criticism, a habit no
    artist should ever be without.

    and am in the same dismay as if I stood on my feet before you. I hope you
    are not going to scrutinize my life and works very critically: nobody's life
    and works will bear it. . . . I knew very well the inside of the old school

    lie under the chestnut trees from which I used to knock the burs with them,

    thirty years ago--it was yesterday. As you get on in the forties you will
    understand that life is chiefly what life has been; and that an author is
    merely one who has had the fortune to remember more of it than other men. A
    good many wise critics will tell you that writing is inventing; but I know
    better than that: it is remembering . . . .<br>"By and by you will all be
    authors, or rather you will realize that you have been authors, as you set
    down for the printed page . . . the history of your life. I hope that
    history will be for each of you a pure and sweet and good one . . . .
    Reflect that you are making your book now, in words and deeds, and that the
    older you grow the more you become merely that book--merely the record of
    yourself; and keep this in mind as you study other men's books. Be true that
    you may get the truth from them . . . . Literature is life, and a clean
    conscience is the best criticism."

    "As . . . you wish to see the letters written under the signature of Harry
    Brown, I have sent what I have of them accordingly; & I add also a specimen
    of the Hero & Leander, though it wants touching again here & there. To the
    former will be added a variety of notes; & though I am not fond of notes to
    works of a less chatting nature, yet the letter also, I think, will admit of
    a preface, such as I may enjoy in writing, & consequently hope the public
    may enjoy in reading. But if you be inclined, Sir, to strike in with me in
    these little publications, (and I am secretly desirous of finding myself
    somewhere, & finding a bookseller that will show an inclination to allow
    some share of profit to a person really not inclined to ask much) I can talk
    with you on the subject to much more advantage personally, than in the
    compass of a sheet of paper. I cannot however come to town just this moment,
    as the latter end of the week is the busiest part of it with me; but
    something perhaps may be settled in the mean time, if you are so inclined; &
    I can afterwards call upon you or Monday or Tuesday, in case you are not
    able to take a walk or ride hither beforehand. The letters are designed to
    be 10 in number, though I should probably add two or three more if you had
    no objection. The Hero & Leander I mean to be about 300 lines; & I make it
    so short, principally, in the first place, because the incidents, I think,
    would not allow of more length consistently with the spirit which ought to
    accompany them; & next, because in case it should succeed, I wish to follow
    it up in the same way with two or three more of those graceful stories of
    antiquity, --such as Bacchus & Ariadne, Admetus & Alcestis; & perhaps Cupid
    & Psyche, --all, of course, told after my own fashion, & not translated or
    borrowed. . . ."<br>Having built a reputation as a dangerous man by
    publishing libelous remarks about the King under his own name and being
    imprisoned for it, Hunt adopted a pseudonym in 1816 in order to continue
    publishing his more satirical literary exploits: "Harry Brown." Hunt wrote a
    series of conversational poems addressed to real figures such as Charles
    Lamb and Thomas Moore entitled, "Harry Brown's Letters to His Friends,"
    which were published in the weekly he co-founded with his brother, the
    Examiner, beginning in the summer of 1816, and which he later offered to the
    publishing firm Taylor and Hessey in the hope they would issue them as a
    volume. Taylor declined, but Hunt continued to write for the Examiner under
    the name Harry Brown until 1821.

    fundamentally friendly about the aphorisms you sent me. They are very simple

    Esprit for Attic Dwellers" in the June 17, 1923 issue], sending a circular
    [not present], speculating how much annually Eliot would require in order to
    take care of himself and his ailing wife, characterizing Eliot's work at the
    bank as an impediment to his important work of writing, explaining that his
    goal is to help Eliot rather than to compete with him, and suggesting that
    investing in Bel Esprit is analogous to the initial outlay required to
    install electric light in a village. 2 pages, 4to, written on two sheets;
    few short closed separations at folds, slight even toning overall, several
    holograph corrections throughout.

    "I have at last seen a copy of N.Y. Times article on Bel Esprit. Miss Rohe
    has been O.K. as to aim of society, and very clear on everything save the
    main point, i.e., that T.S. Eliot has NOT got any benefit from it. . .
    .<br>"We can't rake up Eliot's private affairs every time the subject is
    discussed, but with his wife a chronic invalid he simply can't give up a
    sure 3000 dollars a year for an utterly uncertain 1500.<br>"Given a sure
    1500 or 2000 he MIGHT make 1000 or 1500 by his writing, that is, by his
    really important work . . . .<br>". . . [I]f I wanted to prevent Eliot's
    writing better than I do, I shd, of course try to provide all possible
    impediments, a la Standard Oil.<br>"Unfortunately or fortunately literature
    differs from commerce. . . ."<br>In early 1922, even before the world could
    be astonished by T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land published later that year, Ezra
    Pound hatched a plan to prevent his friend Eliot from wasting his talents
    working as a clerk at Lloyds Bank in London. The idea, dubbed "Bel Esprit,"
    was to collect sufficient subscriptions from wealthy benefactors to allow
    Eliot to make his living by the quill, and the moment was ripe, because
    Eliot had left the bank to recover from a debilitating nervous condition.
    Pound explained to prospective subscribers that the money would be an
    investment in poetry. Only a few joined Bel Esprit, and before the project
    could gather steam, Eliot returned to the bank, seduced by steady income and
    a pension.<br>In the Spring 1971 issue of The Massachusetts Review, the
    letter in this lot is discussed in Donald E. Herdeck's article, "A New
    Letter by Ezra Pound about T.S. Eliot."

    dampstain to top-edges with thin bleed to blank upper margins of contents.
    First edition, inscribed and signed by Trotsky on blank preliminary, "Leon
    Trotsky / 3 Apr 1937 / Coyoacan."  A very few inscribed copies signed in the
    same year and place have appeared on the market over the years, though it is
    certain that at least two of these have traded hands several times so that
    the number of these inscribed copies are less than it initially might
    appear. It is surmised that the Dewey Commission was the occasion from which
    these copies derive. Three years later Trotsky was murdered while still in
    exile in Mexico by Stalin's agents.
