    HOWARD COOK (1901-1980)
    Two woodcuts. Sun and Desolation. 232x346 mm; 9x13 inches, full margins. Edition of 50. Signed and inscribed "Maine House" and "imp." in pencil, lower margin. 1926 * Wind in the Elms. 355x303 mm; 14x11 inches, full margins. Edition of 25 (from an intended edition of 50). Signed, titled and inscribed "50" and "imp." in pencil, lower margin. 1926.Both very good impressions. Duffy 34 and 37.From the Estate of Evelyne Z. Daitz, New York.Cook, most widely known for his lyrical prints of Manhattan, was born in Massachusetts and traveled the continental United States extensively. As a young man, he moved to New York and enrolled in the Art Students League. He studied printmaking there under Joseph Pennell (1857-1926) who, nearing the end of his life, was characterized by his atmospheric cityscape etchings. Cook's interest in the medium increased after a trip to Paris in 1925, where he spent time with fellow ex-pats and master printmakers James E. Allen (1894-1964) and Thomas Handforth (1897-1948).Cook's career took off after a 1926 trip to Maine, when woodcuts he made there were picked up by Forum, one of the most widely-circulated American magazines at the time. The publication subsequently commissioned Cook to create woodcuts of the American Southwest, where he became enamored with New Mexico and the Taos artist's colony, returning throughout his life (he relocated there permanently in 1939 and ultimately died in Santa Fe). By the end of the 1920s, Cook's adept printmaking caught the interest of Carl Zigrosser (1891-1975), the esteemed director of the Weyhe Gallery in New York who supported many emerging artists. In 1929, Zigrosser both hosted Cook's first solo exhibition and encouraged him to travel to Paris, providing him entrée into the venerable lithography studio Atelier Desjobert. Despite experimenting in a range of printmaking techniques, the woodcut remained Cook's medium of choice.At the peak of his career, from the late 1920s until his 1939 move to New Mexico, Cook feverishly depicted a rapidly-changing New York. Construction on skyscrapers flourished in the interwar period, with landmark towers like the Chrysler Building completed in 1930 and the Empire State Building completed the following year, while the Great Depression halted progress on other projects and construction sites remained commonplace. Cook was employed by the Works Progress Administration during this time. Artists like Cook, Louis Lozowick (1892-1973), and Samuel Margolies (1897-1974) embraced the evolving city as their subject, using exaggerated perspective to emphasize the grandeur of buildings, and portraying construction workers as everyday heroes.

Partial-silkscreen poster, unbacked. 1016x762 mm, 40x30 inches. 1939.Lester Beall was one of the first designers commissioned by the U.S. Government to help promote the Rural Electrification Administration. The posters he created in this series, released in three sets for the R.E.A., pitched basic modern amenities to the hinter lands of America, where many such "luxuries" were virtually unknown. The R.E.A. existed not only to help rural America enter into the modern age but also served to create jobs for a Depression-ravaged country. Elevating visual communication to an extremely efficient level, Beall's style involves a technique close to the ideogram, employing clear and direct images, free from any exterior influences that would lessen the pure message.

He served as an illustrator for the Navy during World War I, then moved to New York City where, influenced by the Ashcan School, he began painting in a social realist style. In 1935 he joined the Federal Art Project in the Silk Screen Unit where he was first introduced to the silkscreen method of printmaking. The WPA was integral in the promotion of silkscreening as an artistic technique; developed in the early 1900s it had been used mostly for commercial purposes. Gottlieb continued to be a pioneer of the medium beyond his work with the WPA.

He painted the mural The Arrival of the First Mail in Bronxville in 1846 for the post office in Bronxville, New York. He also created two paintings for the WPA, one The Wigwam, Old Tammany Hall, now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the other Fourteenth Street at Sixth Avenue, originally hung the office of U.S. Sen.

Signed and numbered 15/50 in pencil, lower right. 1929.A superb, dark impression of this extremely scarce etching. Sasowsky 63. Born in Paris, the second son in a well-to-do family, Marsh attended Yale University and then moved to New York where, during the early 1920s, he worked as an illustrator and took classes at the Art Students League. Marsh was equally influenced by his art teachers in New York, notably John Sloan (1871-1951), as well as American Regionalists like Thomas Hart Benton (1889-1975) and Old Masters such as Rubens, Titian and Tintoretto. He wholly rejected the modern artistic movements gaining strength in America at the time—Cubism, Surrealism, Abstraction. Instead he pursued a style that is best summed up as social realism: depictions of everyday life in New York, Coney Island beach scenes, vaudeville and burlesque women, the jobless on the streets of New York and the railroad yards and freight trains in New York and New Jersey.He participated in the federal art programs under the WPA, painting two murals in Washington, DC, and, funded by the Treasury Relief Art Project, completed a series of frescoes in the New York Customs House, now the National Museum of the American Indian, that depict eight New York Harbor scenes and eight portraits of great navigators. It is one of the most celebrated mural installations created under the New Deal in New York City.

Benton was already seen as a leader in the Regionalist movement and a celebrated muralist by the time the WPA started the Federal Arts Program. He had been commissioned to paint murals of life in Indiana for the 1933 Century of Progress Exhibition in Chicago, which caused controversy. In 1934 his work was featured on the cover on Time magazine, which legitimized Regionalism as an art movement. His murals were influential for many of the artists hired as muralists under the WPA.

Each signed, titled and dated in pencil, lower margin. Each 1931.Very good richly-inked impressions. Duffy 161, HH, 171.From the Estate of Evelyne Z. Daitz, New York.Cook, most widely known for his lyrical prints of Manhattan, was born in Massachusetts and traveled the continental United States extensively. As a young man, he moved to New York and enrolled in the Art Students League. He studied printmaking there under Joseph Pennell (1857-1926) who, nearing the end of his life, was characterized by his atmospheric cityscape etchings. Cook's interest in the medium increased after a trip to Paris in 1925, where he spent time with fellow ex-pats and master printmakers James E. Allen (1894-1964) and Thomas Handforth (1897-1948).Cook's career took off after a 1926 trip to Maine, when woodcuts he made there were picked up by Forum, one of the most widely-circulated American magazines at the time. The publication subsequently commissioned Cook to create woodcuts of the American Southwest, where he became enamored with New Mexico and the Taos artist's colony, returning throughout his life (he relocated there permanently in 1939 and ultimately died in Santa Fe). By the end of the 1920s, Cook's adept printmaking caught the interest of Carl Zigrosser (1891-1975), the esteemed director of the Weyhe Gallery in New York who supported many emerging artists. In 1929, Zigrosser both hosted Cook's first solo exhibition and encouraged him to travel to Paris, providing him entrée into the venerable lithography studio Atelier Desjobert. Despite experimenting in a range of printmaking techniques, the woodcut remained Cook's medium of choice.At the peak of his career, from the late 1920s until his 1939 move to New Mexico, Cook feverishly depicted a rapidly-changing New York. Construction on skyscrapers flourished in the interwar period, with landmark towers like the Chrysler Building completed in 1930 and the Empire State Building completed the following year, while the Great Depression halted progress on other projects and construction sites remained commonplace. Cook was employed by the Works Progress Administration during this time. Artists like Cook, Louis Lozowick (1892-1973), and Samuel Margolies (1897-1974) embraced the evolving city as their subject, using exaggerated perspective to emphasize the grandeur of buildings, and portraying construction workers as everyday heroes.

    HOWARD COOK (1901-1980)
    Lower Manhattan. Lithograph. 353x257 mm; 13x10 inches, full margins. Edition of 35 (from an intended edition of 75). Signed, dated and inscribed "75" in pencil, lower margin. 1930.A superb, richly-inked impression of this very scarce lithograph. Duffy 132.Cook, most widely known for his lyrical prints of Manhattan, was born in Massachusetts and traveled the continental United States extensively. As a young man, he moved to New York and enrolled in the Art Students League. He studied printmaking there under Joseph Pennell (1857-1926) who, nearing the end of his life, was characterized by his atmospheric cityscape etchings. Cook's interest in the medium increased after a trip to Paris in 1925, where he spent time with fellow ex-pats and master printmakers James E. Allen (1894-1964) and Thomas Handforth (1897-1948).Cook's career took off after a 1926 trip to Maine, when woodcuts he made there were picked up by Forum, one of the most widely-circulated American magazines at the time. The publication subsequently commissioned Cook to create woodcuts of the American Southwest, where he became enamored with New Mexico and the Taos artist's colony, returning throughout his life (he relocated there permanently in 1939 and ultimately died in Santa Fe). By the end of the 1920s, Cook's adept printmaking caught the interest of Carl Zigrosser (1891-1975), the esteemed director of the Weyhe Gallery in New York who supported many emerging artists. In 1929, Zigrosser both hosted Cook's first solo exhibition and encouraged him to travel to Paris, providing him entrée into the venerable lithography studio Atelier Desjobert. Despite experimenting in a range of printmaking techniques, the woodcut remained Cook's medium of choice.At the peak of his career, from the late 1920s until his 1939 move to New Mexico, Cook feverishly depicted a rapidly-changing New York. Construction on skyscrapers flourished in the interwar period, with landmark towers like the Chrysler Building completed in 1930 and the Empire State Building completed the following year, while the Great Depression halted progress on other projects and construction sites remained commonplace. Cook was employed by the Works Progress Administration during this time. Artists like Cook, Louis Lozowick (1892-1973), and Samuel Margolies (1897-1974) embraced the evolving city as their subject, using exaggerated perspective to emphasize the grandeur of buildings, and portraying construction workers as everyday heroes.

We have not found another impression at auction in the past 30 years. Davenport 30.Cadmus' works for the Works Progress Administration have frequently been envoked in the debate of censorship. Cadmus' tempera on canvas Fleets In!, 1934 for the Public Works of Art Project depicted carousing U.S. sailors on shore leave. Aspects of Suburban Life, 1936 was a series of studies for a Port Washington, Long Island post office mural commissioned by the Treasury Relief Art Project. The project was never realized as it showed affluent Long Islanders in a negative light and insinuated an obvious and growing class divide. Both Cadmus and Jared French (1905-1988) each received mural commissions for the lobby of the Parcel Post Building in Richmond, Virginia, completed in 1939. Cadmus' mural Pocahontas Saving the Life of John Smith was retouched by the artist when it was noticed that one of the Powhatan men's breechcloth fox heads resembled a phallus. The debate over public censorship continues when discussing Cadmus' legacy. In a 1992 New York Times article, the artist's works were still criticized, "For its money, the W.P.A. got several subversive works from Cadmus..."

    Foundry. Lithograph. 406x260 mm; 16x10¼ inches, full margins. Signed and numbered 6/40 in pencil, lower margin. 1938.A very good impression. Muralist Rubenstein was most well-known for his controversial anti-fascist and anti-German mural commissioned by his alma mater Harvard University in 1930. His painting for the Wareham, Massachusetts post office commissioned by the Treasury Section of the Fine Arts in 1940 was less controversial. "Cranberry Pickers" celebrated the harvesters of Massachusetts' most important agricultural export. The migrant workers depicted in the mural are dignified and are painted in a style reminiscent of the Renaissance, which Lewis had studied on a fellowship from Harvard.

Born in Paris, the second son in a well-to-do family, Marsh attended Yale University and then moved to New York where, during the early 1920s, he worked as an illustrator and took classes at the Art Students League. Marsh was equally influenced by his art teachers in New York, notably John Sloan (1871-1951), as well as American Regionalists like Thomas Hart Benton (1889-1975) and Old Masters such as Rubens, Titian and Tintoretto. He wholly rejected the modern artistic movements gaining strength in America at the time--Cubism, Surrealism, Abstraction. Instead he pursued a style that is best summed up as social realism: depictions of everyday life in New York, Coney Island beach scenes, vaudeville and burlesque women, the jobless on the streets of New York and the railroad yards and freight trains in New York and New Jersey.He participated in the federal art programs under the WPA, painting two murals in Washington, DC, and, funded by the Treasury Relief Art Project, completed a series of frescoes in the New York Customs House, now the National Museum of the American Indian, that depict eight New York Harbor scenes and eight portraits of great navigators. It is one of the most celebrated mural installations created under the New Deal in New York City.

Signed and titled in pencil, lower margin. 1926.A very good, richly-inked impression. Duffy 14.From the Estate of Evelyne Z. Daitz, New York.Cook, most widely known for his lyrical prints of Manhattan, was born in Massachusetts and traveled the continental United States extensively. As a young man, he moved to New York and enrolled in the Art Students League. He studied printmaking there under Joseph Pennell (1857-1926) who, nearing the end of his life, was characterized by his atmospheric cityscape etchings. Cook's interest in the medium increased after a trip to Paris in 1925, where he spent time with fellow ex-pats and master printmakers James E. Allen (1894-1964) and Thomas Handforth (1897-1948).Cook's career took off after a 1926 trip to Maine, when woodcuts he made there were picked up by Forum, one of the most widely-circulated American magazines at the time. The publication subsequently commissioned Cook to create woodcuts of the American Southwest, where he became enamored with New Mexico and the Taos artist's colony, returning throughout his life (he relocated there permanently in 1939 and ultimately died in Santa Fe). By the end of the 1920s, Cook's adept printmaking caught the interest of Carl Zigrosser (1891-1975), the esteemed director of the Weyhe Gallery in New York who supported many emerging artists. In 1929, Zigrosser both hosted Cook's first solo exhibition and encouraged him to travel to Paris, providing him entrée into the venerable lithography studio Atelier Desjobert. Despite experimenting in a range of printmaking techniques, the woodcut remained Cook's medium of choice.At the peak of his career, from the late 1920s until his 1939 move to New Mexico, Cook feverishly depicted a rapidly-changing New York. Construction on skyscrapers flourished in the interwar period, with landmark towers like the Chrysler Building completed in 1930 and the Empire State Building completed the following year, while the Great Depression halted progress on other projects and construction sites remained commonplace. Cook was employed by the Works Progress Administration during this time. Artists like Cook, Louis Lozowick (1892-1973), and Samuel Margolies (1897-1974) embraced the evolving city as their subject, using exaggerated perspective to emphasize the grandeur of buildings, and portraying construction workers as everyday heroes.

The complete set comprises the most comprehensive account of the United States ever got together, and nothing since has even approached it."

    This set was gathered by the consignor from bookshops over the course of several decades from the late 1950s to the early 1980s. 36 of the volumes have maps, while most of the others were issued without them; the Washington volume is lacking its original map.

Barber on both title pages. New York, January 1938
  FOOTNOTE: "One-Third of a Nation was one of the most successful--and controversial--productions
    of the Federal Theatre Project. Its title came from a speech by Franklin Roosevelt.
    Presented in a \"living newspaper\" format, it dramatized the issues of high rent
    and homelessness in New York City. It ran for 8 months at Adelphia Theatre in
    New York. Well received by critics, its socialist perspective became a flash-point
    for popular oppostion to the Theatre Project, which led to an investigation by
    the House Committee on Un-American Activities, and the project's abrupt termination
    in mid-1939. \n\nThe typescript offered here is a deluxe extra-illustrated post-production
    version, with color-pencil outlines of the United States on the title pages. The
    first volume contains the complete working script; the exhaustive research behind
    the production is reflected in its 9-page bibliography. The second volume contains
    the production notes: costume plot, lightig charts and cues, music plot, property
    plt, and more. Mounted within are 2 copies of the original folding advertising
    flier, 8 photographs from the production in Volume I, and 6 set-design blueprints
    in Volume II. These copies were prepared for the personal use of Philip Barber,
    director of the Federal Theatre Project, who was also credited as producer of
    the play."

After winning two Guggenheim fellowships in the 1930s, she travelled to Mexico and became well-known and widely respected as a regionalist painter, eventually settling in Oaxaca permanently. She exhibited alongside Marguerite Zorach (1887-1968) at the 1933 Chicago Worlds' Fair.

Sloan, already an estalished artist and teacher at the Art Students League (who taught many artists who particapted in the WPA programs), did not fit that profile, but he did participate in the Treasury Section of Fine Arts, which hired well-known artists for its projects. He painted the mural The Arrival of the First Mail in Bronxville in 1846 for the post office in Bronxville, New York. He also created two paintings for the WPA, one The Wigwam, Old Tammany Hall, now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the other Fourteenth Street at Sixth Avenue, originally hung the office of U.S. Sen. Royal Copeland and now is exhibited at the Detroit Insitute of Arts.

Signed and dated in pencil, lower right. 1936.Provenance: Washburn Gallery, New York with the label; private collection, Florida.Nevelson first received widespread attention as an artist while working for the Federal Art Project. She spent the early 1930s assisting Diego Rivera (1886-1957) on his WPA murals and most notably, the ill-fated Man at the Crossroads mural at Rockefeller Plaza. Nevelson began to sculpt as a result of attending a workshop sponsored by the WPA. At the West Thirty-Ninth Street government sculpture workshop, Nevelson learned sculptural techniques taught by Louis Basky. Basky's apprentice, Alexander Tatti, developed a new technique of casting combining plaster and metal or other hard elements. Nevelson continued to use "tattistone" through the late 1930s.Virtually unknown in the early 1930s, Nevelson was not included in the WPA's roster of fine artists and was hired as a painting teacher at the Flatbush Boys' Club in 1935. A popular instructor, Nevelson also taught with the WPA at the Contemporary Art Center in the 92nd Street YMHA and the Educational Alliance School of Art on the Lower East Side. Between 1935 and 1939, Nevelson exhibited in WPA sponsored exhibitions at least seven times, garnering notice from leading New York art critics and becoming a favorite by jurists. In July 1939, Nevelson was one of the 75% of artists laid off by the WPA in New York, though the program had a lasting impact. In appreciation of the artist community the WPA fostered, Nevelson once stated "Without the WPA New York would not be the number one art center today."

Cadmus' mural Pocahontas Saving the Life of John Smith was retouched by the artist when it was noticed that one of the Powhatan men's breechcloth fox heads resembled a phallus. The debate over public censorship continues when discussing Cadmus' legacy.

After World War I, she attended the Académie de la Grande Chaumiere in Paris. Upon her return to New York, Walton rejected her formal training and began to carve directly into wood, a physically demanding and expressive task. One of her experimental trademarks was leaving the inherent roughness and incised lines in the wood. Her first solo exhibition was with Weyhe Gallery in New York in 1933, the same year she exhibited her sculpture at The Museum of Modern Art's "American Sources of Modern Art" show. She was awarded commissions from the Treasury Section of Fine Arts, one being a set of three limestone wall reliefs in the Pittston, Pennsylvania post office.

Sasowsky 15.Born in Paris, the second son in a well-to-do family, Marsh attended Yale University and then moved to New York where, during the early 1920s, he worked as an illustrator and took classes at the Art Students League. Marsh was equally influenced by his art teachers in New York, notably John Sloan (1871-1951), as well as American Regionalists like Thomas Hart Benton (1889-1975) and Old Masters such as Rubens, Titian and Tintoretto. He wholly rejected the modern artistic movements gaining strength in America at the time--Cubism, Surrealism, Abstraction. Instead, he pursued a style that is best summed up as social realism: depictions of everyday life in New York, Coney Island beach scenes, vaudeville and burlesque women, the jobless on the streets of New York and the railroad yards and freight trains in New York and New Jersey.He participated in the federal art programs under the WPA, painting two murals in Washington, D.C., and, funded by the Treasury Relief Art Project, completed a series of frescoes in the New York Customs House, now the National Museum of the American Indian, that depict eight New York Harbor scenes and eight portraits of great navigators. It is one of the most celebrated mural installations created under the New Deal in New York City.
