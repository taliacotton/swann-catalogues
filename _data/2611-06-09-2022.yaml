    during his mid-teens and as he aspired to become an artist, are exceedingly
    scarce.  There are only several contemporaneous early watercolors, mostly
    studies of ships and figures, now in the collection of the Whitney Museum of
    American Art (Josephine N. Hopper Bequest), and not another landscape
    watercolor from this early period with as complete a composition as the

    twenty miles northwest of Hopper's boyhood home in Nyack, New York.  This is
    among the largest, most developed ink landscape drawing by Hopper
    (1882-1967) from the early decades of his career and likely drawn from
    nature that we have located.  There is another, Study of a Forest with
    Stream, pen and ink, circa 1899-1906, now in the Whitney Museum of American
    Art (Josephine N. Hopper Bequest), New York, as well as Camp Nyack,
    Greenwood Lake (a location slightly southwest of Hogencamp Mountain), pen
    and ink, 1900, that sold at Christie's, New York, September 28, 2010, lot
    45.<br><br>In a letter he wrote to an editor in 1935, recalling his early
    artistic pursuit, Hopper noted, "In every artist's development the germ of
    the later work is always found in the earlier.  The nucleus around which the
    artist's intellect builds his work is himself; the central ego, personality,
    or whatever it may be called, and this changes little from birth to death. 
    What he was once, he always is, with slight modification.  Changing fashions
    in methods or subject matter alter him little or not at all," (Levin, Edward
    Hopper as Illustrator, New York, 1979, page 1).

    one of America's most accomplished Modern colorists, was largely overlooked
    for the majority of his career.  Now, however, his place alongside Georgia
    O'Keeffe, John Marin, Marsden Hartley and Max Weber—all fellow exhibitors at
    Alfred Stieglitz's gallery, 291, in New York—is recognized, and he ranks
    among the group of the most modern and influential artists in America during
    the early 20th century.<br><br>After developing a friendship with Stieglitz
    around 1911, and after a drawn-out litigation to rightfully claim his
    recognition and compensation for designing the Bronx, New York courthouse,
    Bluemner decided to turn completely to painting in 1912 and embarked on a
    seven month European voyage.  Upon his return, after exposure to works by
    Paul Cézanne, Vincent van Gogh, as well as the Fauves and Cubists,
    Bluemner's work reflected a dramatic shift toward the bright, streamlined
    style that would define his work and parallel the avant-garde developments
    made by other American modern artists during the early 20th century.  Like
    Edward Hopper, Bluemner traveled widely along the east coast, mostly in the
    countryside surrounding New York, and made numerous watercolor studies of
    landscapes and buildings, many of which are devoid of human presence.

    Illustrating at 114 West Thirty-fourth Street.  His parents had not objected

    had a frequent glimpse of the ship building yards in and around Nyack as
    well as the busy shipping traffic on the river itself, in addition to what
    appears to have been an insatiable interest in ships and the sea from the
    multitude of early drawings he made of these subjects.  His first signed oil
    painting, from 1895, depicts a Rowboat in a Rocky Cove, and among his most
    accomplished early oils is Ships, circa 1898, now in the collection of the
    Foosaner Art Museum, Melbourne, Florida, which he copied from a painting by
    the American artist Edward Moran (1829-1901).

    Both circa 1900.  Both approximately 397x460 mm; 15⅝x18 inches.  One signed
    in ink, lower center recto, the other signed twice in ink, lower left
    recto.  <br><br>Provenance: Estate of the artist; Zabriskie Gallery, New
    York; Estate of Virginia M. Zabriskie.<br><br>Walkowitz (1878-1965) was born
    in Tyumen, Siberia to Jewish parents and immigrated to the Lower East Side
    of New York with his mother in 1889.  He was trained in the academic style
    at the National Academy of Design, New York, and also at the Académie Julian
    in Paris, though his style was most influenced by his experiences outside of
    the studio.  Walkowitz's studies in Paris intersected with Edward's Hopper's
    sojourns there at the same time, while Hopper was primarily studying the
    works of the Old Master artists.  During his time in Paris from 1906-07,
    Walkowitz saw Isadora Duncan (1877-1927) dance at Auguste Rodin's
    (1840-1917) Paris studio and made his first drawings of her. He later
    recalled, "She was a Muse.  She had no laws.  She didn't dance according to
    rules.  She created.  Her body was music.  It was a body electric, like Walt
    Whitman."  Like Duncan's dancing, Walkowitz's drawings and watercolors were
    created by quick and spontaneous lines and washes of color.  In Paris,
    Walkowitz was also impressed by the landmark 1907 Paul Cézanne (1839-1906)
    retrospective exhibit at the Salon d'Automne and by his introduction to the
    work of Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and Henri Rousseau (1844-1910).  By the
    time Walkowitz returned to New York, his style was heavily influenced by
    European Modernism, with emphasis on gestures, simplified forms and flat
    planes of bold color.  His first solo exhibition was held at Haas Gallery,
    the back of a modest frame shop, in New York in 1908.<br><br>In 1912,
    Walkowitz met Albert Stieglitz (1864-1946) through Marsden Hartley
    (1877-1943) and became involved with 291, Steiglitz's New York gallery,
    which served as a hub of American modernism.  Stieglitz was so impressed by
    the young artist, that he sent him to study art in Greece, Italy and North
    Africa in 1914.  His style became more abstract; its reduced linear forms
    lent themselves to the city's rush skyward, prematurely anticipating the New
    York School and the Abstract Expressionists.<br><br>In 1913, Walkowitz was
    represented at the Armory Show and in the 1916 Forum exhibition.  Walkowitz
    was concerned with politics and artists' rights and was active in various
    artist's groups, founding the People's Art Guild and the Society of
    Independent Artists (he became director of the latter from 1918 to 1938). 
    In 1920, he exhibited at the Société Anonyme alongside Hartley and Joseph
    Stella (1877-1946).  Despite local and international recognition, Walkowitz
    was not nearly as well-known as his contemporaries.  Walkowitz painted into
    the 1940s, when his eyesight began to fail.

    work, in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art (Josephine N.
    Hopper Bequest).  From this very early treatment of the subject, at just 16
    years old, only a year before he began art studies with a correspondence
    course in 1899 and soon after transferred to the New York School of Art and
    Design (the forerunner of Parsons The New School for Design), Hopper
    frequently returned to the theme of aloneness (and loneliness) in many of
    his most iconic works, including the oil paintings Automat, 1927, Morning
    Sun, 1952, and Office in a Small City, 1953, as well as the etching Night
    Shadows, 1921.<br><br>According to Levin, "Hopper brought to his art and to
    illustration a cool detachment reflecting the reserve with which he dealt
    with the world around him.  His personality, especially his shyness, did not
    lend itself to illustrating fiction that was either overly sentimental or
    involved with fantasy.  Hopper preferred to depict what he observed in the
    most matter-of-fact manner.  When he had to illustrate to earn a living, he
    found greater freedom in the illustration of nonfiction topics, particularly
    for trade publications," (Levin, Edward Hopper as Illustrator, New York,
    1979, page 5).

    spontaneity of the "wet-on-wet" technique echoed that of Whistler.  Meaux, a
    town northeast of Paris, dovetailed into Marin's early inclination towards
    picturesque, decorative subjects synonymous with the previous century. 
    Marin's  "wet-on-wet" technique, allowing for the blurring or melting of the
    subjects as in the current work, enabled him to fulfill the late 19th
    century tenet of the direct observation of the moment and the importance of
    conveying the instantaneous mood of the scene.

    15-year old Hopper (1882-1967) positioned the isolated figure, an ivory soap
    saleswoman, in a theatrical setting resembling a marionette booth.  There
    are no patrons or other figures present in the composition; stillness and
    eeriness dominate the scene, emphasized by the darkly-shaded background. 
    The subject appears to be commonplace, but also invites the viewer to
    interpret the narrative, like many of Hopper's iconic works.  Decades later,
    the figure of the usherette in Hopper's oil painting New York Movie,
    1938-39, lost in her thoughts against a dark backdrop, would echo the
    contemplative mood evoked by the current drawing.

    likely encountered through a reproductive print of the Victorian master's
    work.  Hopper explored subjects centered on couples throughout his career,

    drawing, most famously in his oil paintings Summer Evening, 1947, and

    (1865-1929) was a leading Ashcan artist, a prominent figure in the revolt
    against American academic art, and Hopper's teacher during the early 1900s. 
    As an art instructor, Henri preached originality and urged Hopper's further
    study of European art.  "Hopper had heard Henri praise the work of European
    artists such as Daumier, Courbet, Degas, Manet, Renoir, Rembrandt, Hals,
    Velásquez, Goya, and El Greco, and like so many of Henri's students, felt he
    should travel to Europe to see the works of these great masters firsthand. 
    So, with his parents' help, he left for Paris in October 1906 and did not
    return until the following August," (Levin, Edward Hopper as Illustrator,
    New York, 1979, page 11).

    Drawn directly.  He posed for me one evening when he came over from New York
    for a day or two--on the occasion of his visit to Philadelphia just prior to
    my removal to New York."  Henri became Sloan's mentor in 1892 and the
    following year they co-founded the short-lived Charcoal Club, whose members
    would also include William Glackens, George Luks and Everett Shinn.  Sloan
    was still working as an illustrator in Philadelphia at the time and would
    ultimately move to New York in 1904, where he became of member of the group
    known as The Eight and one of the founders of the Ashcan school of American
    art, many of whose fellow artists—Sloan included—would interact with and
    have an impact on Hopper and vice versa.  Morse 70.

    statesman among the artists at the school, among the most talented and
    renowned 19th century American Impressionist artists, and an immensely
    influential teacher, fostering the early careers of artists such as George
    Bellows, Howard Chandler Christy, Charles Demuth, Marsden Hartley, John
    Marin, Georgia O'Keeffe, Joseph Stella and many others.

    famous portrait painting of the Pamphili Pope, Innocent X (ruled 1644-1655)
    by the Spanish Golden Age master Diego Velázquez (1599-1660).  Considered
    among the finest portraits ever painted, and now in the Galleria Doria
    Pamphili in Rome, Velázquez's work has prompted numerous artistic studies
    and responses.  Perhaps most famously, the Irish-born artist Francis Bacon
    (1909-1992) painted a series of distorted variants, often known as the
    "Screaming Popes," which total more than forty-five known versions executed
    during the 1950s and early 1960s.<br><br>One of the motivators behind

    York School of Art and Design, the forerunner of Parsons The New School for
    Design, with William Merritt Chase (1849-1916) and Robert Henri (1865-1929),
    the latter of whom taught life drawing and stressed originality to his
    students.  There are nearly fifty such academic studies, both male and
    female nudes, many also with added marginal "doodles" like the current
    drawing, now in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art
    (Josephine N. Hopper Bequest).  The current drawing of a man in a suit is
    drawn over another quickly, more lightly-sketched figure of a woman in a
    dress.  The initials "R.F." upper right recto might refer to the name of the

    <br><br>Bellows (1882-1925) was part of the second generation of Aschan
    School artists. Born in Columbus, Ohio he worked as a commercial illustrator
    as a student at The Ohio State University from 1901-04. After Ohio State, he
    moved to New York where he studied with Robert Henri and soon became
    associated with the Aschan artists. He depicted scenes of everyday life in
    New York that were rooted in realism. He started making lithographs in 1916
    and revived interest in the medium as at the time etching was the preferred
    printmaking method. Lithography gave him a steady stream of income to

    <br><br>Bellows was a family friend of the superintendent of the State
    Hospital at Columbus, Ohio.  He noted that "for years the amusement hall was
    a gloomy old brown vault where on Thursday nights the patients indulged in
    'Round Dances' interspersed with two-steps and waltzes by the visitors. 
    Each of the characters in this print represents a definite individual...
    This is the happier side of a vast world which a more considerate and wiser
    society would reduce to a not inconsiderable degree." Mason 49.

    his surroundings (he lived most of his life in small towns).  Like William

    <br><br>Burchfield was born in Ashtabula Harbor, Ohio and attended the

    (Burchfield in turn, wrote an essay for Hopper's 1933 retrospective at the
    Museum of Modern Art, New York).  Hopper wrote that Burchfield, "Has
    extracted a quality that we may call poetic, romantic, lyric . . . By
    sympathy with the particular he had made it epic and universal."  Like
    Hopper, Burchfield was able to stop working commercially and focus on
    painting full time after finding gallery representation.   In 1929, Frank K.
    M. Rehn Galleries in New York, the same gallery that represented Hopper,

    richly-inked impression of this extremely scarce etching.<br><br>We have
    found only one other impression at auction in the past 30 years. 
    <br><br>Like John Marin early in his career, Hassam (1859-1935) was inspired
    by the etchings of James A. M. Whistler.  A reluctant printmaker who reveled
    in the colors of painting, Hassam drew a few of his plates during his
    training in Paris, circa 1898, though he did not return to them until 1915
    as a mature artist.  As Royal Cortissoz stated, Hassam's etchings, aside
    from being technically brilliant, bear "a certain joie de vivre implicit in
    all Mr. Hassam's work.  The thing that has stamped him has been the happy,
    inspiriting nature of his impressions of the American Scene."  Hassam was
    equally fascinated with the urban environment as well as the countryside,
    both treated in an individualistic manner intrinsic to American art.  In
    review of Hassam's etchings in 1923, Joseph Pennell, an artistic rival,
    wrote to Hassam, "America, our country, is full of subjects, and that our
    New York is the most marvelous and endless subject on the face of the earth
    . . . your show is another proof that New England is also worth doing . . .
    that there are other methods besides tracing photographs, of drawing nudes,
    and that there are other ways and other motives than even yours and mine for
    etching New York." Since his emergence as a printmaker in 1915, Hassam had
    not run out of subject matter, he completed 380 etchings in his lifetime.

    diary, Sloan (1871-1951) wrote, "The subject of this plate is one which I
    have had in mind—night, the roofs back of us—a girl in deshabille at a
    window and a man on the roof smoking his pipe."  It seems that he struggled
    with the execution of this idea, however; at various points he refers to
    this plate as "a pretty bad snarl," and "a mess of line."  After roughly two
    years of work, a substantial amount of time for an etching of this size, he
    finally deemed the plate fit for publishing.  <br><br>According to Levin,
    "Hopper may have first met John Sloan as early as April 1904, just after
    Sloan's move to New York where he lived in the same building as Robert
    Henri, but certainly by 1906 when Sloan substituted for Henri for one month
    at the New York School of Art.  For Hopper, Sloan represented one artist he
    could respect who prior to 1916 had worked regularly as a commercial
    illustrator.  Sloan's influence is particularly visible during Hopper's
    formative years," (Levin, Edward Hopper as Illustrator, New York, 1979, page
    9).  Morse 152.

    of Fifth Avenue, New York, drawn from life, looking north from 34th Street
    (from the site of the Empire State building today). <br><br>Like John Marin
    early in his career, Hassam (1859-1935) was inspired by the etchings of
    James A. M. Whistler.  A reluctant printmaker who reveled in the color of
    painting, Hassam drew a few of his plates during his training in Paris,
    circa 1898, though he did not return to them until 1915 as a mature artist. 
    As Royal Cortissoz stated, Hassam's etchings, aside from being technically
    brilliant, bear "a certain joie de vivre implicit in all Mr. Hassam's work. 
    The thing that has stamped him has been the happy, inspiriting nature of his
    impressions of the American Scene."  Hassam was equally fascinated with the
    urban environment as well as the countryside, both treated in an
    individualistic manner intrinsic to American art.  In review of Hassam's
    etchings in 1923, Joseph Pennell, an artistic rival, wrote to Hassam,
    "America, our country, is full of subjects, and that our New York is the
    most marvelous and endless subject on the face of the earth . . . your show
    is another proof that New England is also worth doing . . . that there are
    other methods besides tracing photographs, of drawing nudes, and that there
    are other ways and other motives than even yours and mine for etching New
    York." Since his emergence as a printmaker in 1915, Hassam had not run out
    of subject matter, he completed 380 etchings in his lifetime.

    Chicago.<br><br>Marguerite Thomas Zorach (1887-1968) and her husband William
    (1887-1966) are renowned for their innovation during the rise of American
    modernism, embodied by their unique blend of Cubism and Fauvism as well as
    the scope of their varied careers.  Marguerite was an early exponent of
    modernism in America, born in California into a well-to-do family.  She
    exhibited an interest in art at an early age, and studied at Stanford
    University before traveling to Paris with her aunt, where she was introduced
    to Gertrude Stein and exposed to the work of Henri Matisse. There she
    discovered her affinity for the color palette of the Fauves. Marguerite
    studied for a period of time at the conservative Académie de la Grande
    Chaumière before attending the progressive art school La Palette, where she
    met her future husband, William. Their marriage, in 1912, began a strong
    companionship in which the two artists consistently inspired, influenced and
    shaped each another’s artistic lives.<br><br>Born in 1887 in Lithuania,
    William Zorach immigrated to Cleveland, with his family at age 4. He worked
    as both a sculptor and watercolorist at the vanguard of American modernism,
    after briefly studying in Paris in the early 1910s.  While Zorach initially
    practiced painting, his interests in sculpture, which took root in 1917,
    soon eclipsed all other media.  By the 1930s, Zorach was regarded as one of
    America’s premier sculptors and was honored with multiple commissions and
    exhibitions including shows at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York,
    and the Art Institute of Chicago.

    York where he studied with Robert Henri and soon became associated with the
    Aschan artists.  He depicted scenes of everyday life in New York that were
    rooted in realism.  While he was known for his urban scenes, he also created
    many portraits throughout his career capturing the spirit of the sitter,
    often who were friends or family members, with a more delicate and detailed
    touch.

    and traveled extensively, to New York in 1904 and then to Europe, Egypt,
    Burma, and Java, before returning to the United States in 1914.  From 1918
    to 1933, he alternated time between New York and Anticoli, Italy.  Sterne's
    movements allowed him to explore different styles and subjects, never
    settling on an identity for long.  <br><br>Sterne met Dodge (1879-1962), an
    artist and wealthy heiress born in Buffalo, New York, while attending a
    ballet recital in the summer of 1914 or 1915.  Sterne, said of her, "The
    woman I was then to visit puzzled and intrigued me, attracted and repelled
    me.  She was entirely different from the kind of woman I had always been
    attracted to before . . . Her most amazing feature was her eyes.  They were
    cool, dark gray pools, shaded with long black lashes.  They reflected her
    complex emotions spontaneously and honestly, could flash up with fury . . .
    or glow with rapture."   During their summer in Cape Cod in 1915, Sterne
    completed a series Portraits of Mabel Dodge, which was shown in New York
    that winter.  The two artists, though their relationship rife with conflict,
    married in Peekskill, New York in 1917, against the advice of their friends
    and families.  Thereafter the couple moved to Taos, New Mexico.  In 1918,
    Sterne moved back to New York and Dodge and her son remained in New Mexico. 
    The two officially divorced in December 1922.

    Private collection, Chicago.<br><br>Perhaps more than any other American
    artist returning from Paris in the first decade of the 20th century, Weber
    (1881-1961), an avid student of art history who possessed a critical eye for
    the avant-garde, skillfully incorporated the new directions of French modern
    art into his work.  Weber absorbed the primitivism of his good friend, the
    self-taught artist Henri Rousseau, the early Cubism of Georges Braque and
    Pablo Picasso and the Fauvism of Henri Matisse and Émile Othon
    Frieze.<br><br>Born in Poland and emigrating to Brooklyn at the age of ten,
    Weber studied at the Pratt Institute under pioneering modernist teacher,
    Arthur Wesley Dow, who was also an important influence on Weber as an
    accomplished printmaker and painter himself.  In the early 1920s, Weber
    traveled to Paris just in time to view a major Paul Cézanne retrospective,
    as well as visit Gertrude Stein’s artistic salon and take classes at
    Matisse’s private academy.  Weber worked in singular modern style throughout
    most of his career and influenced many following generations of American
    artists.

    career, like many of his near contemporaries and fellow artists, including
    John Sloan and Edward Hopper, as an illustrator.  He worked initially in
    Philadelphia, became friends with Sloan and Robert Henri, and moved to New
    York in 1897 to continue working as an illustrator.  As his career as a fine
    artist progressed, Shinn became best known for street scenes and theatrical
    subjects, regarding the theatre as a place of satisfying illusion.  Like
    Hopper, Shinn's best works effectively captured a slice of American urban
    life in the first decades of the 20th century, in both a realist and a
    romantic spirit.

    scarce etching, with selective wiping at the plate border, inked in the
    manner of a monotype, with very strong contrasts and with crisp, partially
    inky plate edges.<br><br>Stieglitz (1864-1946) was a gallery owner and
    photographer who founded the famed gallery, 291, on Fifth Avenue, a
    pioneering New York institution that exhibited early 20th Century European
    art before it gained popularity in America.  Stieglitz not only focused on
    the European avant-garde, but also fostered and propelled the careers of
    important American modernists.<br><br>Marin (1870-1953), renowned for his
    abstract watercolors and prints of landscapes and cityscapes (particularly
    of New York), was closely associated with Stieglitz.  Their rapport began
    when Marin met Stieglitz's agent, Edward Steichen, while they were both in
    Paris in 1908 (Marin had been in Paris since 1905, making etchings very much
    in the style of James A. M. Whistler and working to establish himself as a
    fine artist).  Steichen directed Stieglitz's attention to Marin's work,
    which prompted the galley director to visit Marin's Parisian apartment. 
    Stieglitz was extremely impressed and the following year, at 291 in New
    York, he held an exhibition of Marin's works.  When Marin returned to the
    United States in 1911, Stieglitz began supplying him with a yearly stipend
    that would support and encourage his artistic output.<br><br>Even after 291
    closed, Stieglitz continued to promote Marin's work and ultimately helped
    him attain critical acclaim.  Marin's first major retrospective was held at
    the Daniel Gallery in New York in 1920.  Stieglitz featured Marin's work in
    the famous "Seven Americans" exhibition at the Anderson Gallery, New York,
    and arranged another retrospective for the artist at his new gallery, the
    Intimate Gallery, in December 1925.<br><br>We have found only 9 other
    impressions of this etching at auction in the past 30 years.  Zigrosser
    cites only 5 impressions from the second state in public collections.

    superb, richly-inked impression of this extremely scarce
    etching.<br><br>Soon after he arrived in New York in 1911, following a six
    year sojourn in Europe, mainly Paris, where he had sharpened his skill as a
    printmaker under the influence of masters such as James A. M. Whistler and
    Charles Meryon, Marin (1870-1953) made a conscious shift in style, from what
    can loosely be described as a more traditional Neo-Impressionist model to a
    novel, expressive, modern form of abstraction.  He attributed this
    transition to the city itself, and recalled of New York, "Shall we consider
    the life of a great city as confined simply to the people and animals on the
    streets and in its buildings?  Are the buildings themselves dead?  We have
    been told somewhere that a work of art is a thing alive.  You cannot create
    a work of art unless the things you behold respond to something within you. 
    Therefore if these buildings move me, they too must have life.  Thus the
    whole city is alive; buildings, people all are alive; and the more they move
    me the more I feel them to be alive.<br><br>It is this moving of me that I
    try to express, so that I may recall the spell I have been under and behold
    the expression of the different emotions that have been called into being. 
    How am I to express what I feel, so that its expression will bring me back
    under the spells?  Shall I copy facts photographically?<br><br>I see great
    forces at work; great movements; the large buildings and the small
    buildings; the warring of the great and the small; influences of one mass on
    another greater or smaller mass.  Feelings are aroused which give me the
    desire to express the reaction of these 'pull forces'; those influences
    which play with one another; great masses pulling smaller masses, each
    subject to some degree to the other's power," (the artist's introduction to
    his exhibition of watercolors at 291, Stieglitz's New York gallery, in
    1913).  Zigrosser 114.

    Pencil on card stock, 1912.  238x173 mm; 9¼x6¾ inches.   Signed and dated in
    pencil, lower center recto.<br><br>Provenance: Givon Fine Art, Tel Aviv;
    Galerie Michael Hasenclever, Munich, July 1980; private collection,
    Germany.<br><br>Walkowitz (1878-1965) was born in Tyumen, Siberia to Jewish
    parents and immigrated to the Lower East Side of New York with his mother in
    1889.  He was trained in the academic style at the National Academy of
    Design, New York, and also at the Académie Julian in Paris, though his style
    was most influenced by his experiences outside of the studio.  Walkowitz's
    studies in Paris intersected with Edward's Hopper's sojourns there at the
    same time, while Hopper was primarily studying the works of the Old Master
    artists.  During his time in Paris from 1906-07, Walkowitz saw Isadora
    Duncan (1877-1927) dance at Auguste Rodin's (1840-1917) Paris studio and
    made his first drawings of her. He later recalled, "She was a Muse.  She had
    no laws.  She didn't dance according to rules.  She created.  Her body was
    music.  It was a body electric, like Walt Whitman."  Like Duncan's dancing,
    Walkowitz's drawings and watercolors were created by quick and spontaneous
    lines and washes of color.  In Paris, Walkowitz was also impressed by the
    landmark 1907 Paul Cézanne (1839-1906) retrospective exhibit at the Salon
    d'Automne and by his introduction to the work of Henri Matisse (1869-1954)
    and Henri Rousseau (1844-1910).  By the time Walkowitz returned to New York,
    his style was heavily influenced by European Modernism, with emphasis on
    gestures, simplified forms and flat planes of bold color.  His first solo
    exhibition was held at Haas Gallery, the back of a modest frame shop, in New
    York in 1908.<br><br>In 1912, Walkowitz met Albert Stieglitz (1864-1946)
    through Marsden Hartley (1877-1943) and became involved with 291,
    Stieglitz's New York gallery, which served as a hub of American modernism. 
    Stieglitz was so impressed by the young artist, that he sent him to study
    art in Greece, Italy and North Africa in 1914.  His style became more
    abstract; its reduced linear forms lent themselves to the city's rush
    skyward, prematurely anticipating the New York School and the Abstract
    Expressionists.<br><br>In 1913, Walkowitz was represented at the Armory Show
    and in the 1916 Forum exhibition.  Walkowitz was concerned with politics and
    artists' rights and was active in various artist's groups, founding the
    People's Art Guild and the Society of Independent Artists (he became
    director of the latter from 1918 to 1938).  In 1920, he exhibited at the
    Société Anonyme alongside Hartley and Joseph Stella (1877-1946).  Despite
    local and international recognition, Walkowitz was not nearly as well-known
    as his contemporaries.  Walkowitz painted into the 1940s, when his eyesight
    began to fail.

    created by quick and spontaneous lines and washes of color.  In Paris,
    Walkowitz was also impressed by the landmark 1907 Paul Cézanne (1839-1906)
    retrospective exhibit at the Salon d'Automne and by his introduction to the
    work of Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and Henri Rousseau (1844-1910).  By the
    time Walkowitz returned to New York, his style was heavily influenced by
    European Modernism, with emphasis on gestures, simplified forms and flat
    planes of bold color.  His first solo exhibition was held at Haas Gallery,
    the back of a modest frame shop, in New York in 1908.<br><br>In 1912,
    Walkowitz met Albert Stieglitz (1864-1946) through Marsden Hartley
    (1877-1943) and became involved with 291 Gallery, Stieglitz's New York
    gallery, which served as a hub of American modernism.  Stieglitz was so
    impressed by the young artist, that he sent him to study art in Greece,
    Italy and North Africa in 1914.  His style became more abstract; its reduced
    linear forms lent themselves to the city's rush skyward, prematurely
    anticipating the New York School and the Abstract Expressionists.<br><br>In
    1913, Walkowitz was represented at the Armory Show and in the 1916 Forum
    exhibition.  Walkowitz was concerned with politics and artists' rights and
    was active in various artist's groups, founding the People's Art Guild and
    the Society of Independent Artists (he became director of the latter from
    1918 to 1938).  In 1920, he exhibited at the Société Anonyme alongside
    Hartley and Joseph Stella (1877-1946).  Despite local and international
    recognition, Walkowitz was not nearly as well-known as his contemporaries. 
    Walkowitz painted into the 1940s, when his eyesight began to fail.

    print.<br><br>Zorach (1887-1966) completed the majority of his printed œuvre
    from 1914 to the early 1920s, most reflecting his love of nature or his
    transcendentalist philosophy (other prints served as announcements or
    greeting cards).  He was often inspired by his summer retreats away from New
    York.  In 1913 and 1914, Zorach and his wife, artist Marguerite, spent their
    summer in Chappaqua, New York.  Their summer destinations also included
    Randolph, New Hampshire; Echo Farm, Plainfield, New Hampshire; Provincetown,
    Massachusetts; Stoningtown, Maine; and the island of Robinhood, Maine.  The
    current work is imbued with Zorach's love of the outdoors.  Here, six
    figures appear in harmony with the wilderness, recalling Zorach's words
    about his summer in Chappaqua, "The country was a new world to me—every
    flower and every weed was a revelation of color and design.  The richness of
    invention in nature was unbelievable... Flowers bloomed, wildlife carried
    on, clouds floated, trees designed themselves in the landscapes.  Nude
    figures lay around pools, played with children made love, dreamed."

    (1893-1967) works transcend the Regionalist label that is often applied to
    the artist.  He both a realist and abstractionist.  Though he strived to
    create a strong sense of human emotion and thought in his works, he often
    did not simply document the reality of his surroundings (he lived most of
    his life in small towns).  Like William Zorach and Emil Bisttram, Burchfield
    saw nature as being endowed with mystical and mysterious qualities, which he
    communicated in his works.  <br><br>Burchfield was born in Ashtabula Harbor,
    Ohio and attended the Cleveland School of Art from 1912 to 1916.  He began
    his career in Buffalo, New York working as a wallpaper designer for M. H.
    Birge & Sons Company.  It was during this time period that Burchfield's work
    was more rooted in suburban realism.  Burchfield and Edward Hopper began
    their friendship in 1928, after Hopper wrote favorably of Burchfield's work
    in Arts magazine (Burchfield in turn, wrote an essay for Hopper's 1933
    retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, New York).  Hopper wrote that
    Burchfield, "Has extracted a quality that we may call poetic, romantic,
    lyric . . . By sympathy with the particular he had made it epic and
    universal."  Like Hopper, Burchfield was able to stop working commercially
    and focus on painting full time after finding gallery representation.  In
    1929, Frank K. M. Rehn Galleries in New York, the same gallery that
    represented Hopper, began showing Burchfield's works.  Through the 1930s,
    Burchfield was the recipient of international recognition; Life magazine
    declared him one of America's greatest painters in December 1936.  In the
    1940s, Burchfield's works became more spiritual, transcendental and based in
    nature.

    involved the creation of numerous sketches ranging from quick compositional
    ideas to small details in the pictures.  Hopper once noted, “I make various
    small sketches, sketches of the thing that I wish to do, also sketches of
    details in the picture.”  For his iconic oil painting Nighthawks, 1942,
    Hopper created many small scale sketches and storyboards, focusing on
    details from the hands of the man holding a cigarette to the coffee urns on
    the cafe counter top.  After creating a multitude of sketches, Hopper made a
    final study of all the elements together before embarking on the final oil
    painting.

    after his arrival in the United States in 1900.  The two artists shared
    discontent over their commercial careers.  In 1927, Lewis was given a solo
    exhibition at Kennedy & Company in New York and successive shows at the
    gallery were so well received that Lewis, like Hopper after his own first
    taste of success, stopped commercial work after 1929.  <br><br>Lewis's
    career was built upon his technical virtuosity in printmaking.  Lewis's
    first interest in printmaking has been tied to his work for the Sydney
    newspaper Bulletin in the 1890s.   While in Australia, he was exposed to
    works of several important etchers, including Australian artist Arthur
    Streeton, as well as Seymour Haden (Whistler's brother-in-law), Rembrandt,
    Charles Meryon, and James A. M. Whistler, but there was no known attempt to
    etch before Lewis reached the United States.  Lewis's first documented
    print, Smoke Pillar, Weehawken, printed in 1915, (see McCarron 1) has enough
    technical skill to argue that this was not the artist's first attempt (he
    was known to have destroyed unsatisfactory impressions).  The same year,
    Lewis encouraged Hopper to take up printmaking and gave him technical
    advice.  After this exchange, Hopper created his own etching Paris Street
    Scene with Carriage, 1915-18 (see Levin 6).  While Lewis would employ
    aquatint and other processes in conjunction with etching, Hopper continued
    to work with only etching and drypoint.  Nevertheless, the two artists would
    use largely the same subject matter and compositional elements, like cutting
    angles and the interplay between light and shadow.  McCarron 54.

    drypoint there in between drawing classes.  Looking back at her time at the
    League, Bacon said, "The years at the Art Students League were a very
    important chunk of life to me and very exhilarating.  It was the first time
    in my life, of course, that I had met and gotten to know familiarly a group
    of young people who were all headed the same way with the same interests. 
    In fact it was practically parochial."  From the 1910s to the  1930s, she
    worked mainly in drypoint printmaking and also doing illustrations for the
    satirical magazine Bad News, while her later drawings appeared as
    illustrations in publications including The New Yorker, New Republic,
    Fortune and Vanity Fair.  She further went on to illustrate over 60 books,
    19 of which she also wrote.<br><br>Bacon exhibited frequently in New York
    from the 1910s onward, with galleries including Alfred Stieglitz's Intimate
    Gallery, the Weyhe Gallery and the Downtown Gallery (she had more than 32
    solo exhibitions during her career), and was closely connected with other
    artists with ties to these galleries, including Katherine Schmidt and Yasuo
    Kuniyoshi.

    impression.<br><br>Lewis (1881-1962) had met Edward Hopper approximately 15
    years after his arrival in the United States in 1900.  The two artists
    shared discontent over their commercial careers.  In 1927, Lewis was given a
    solo exhibition at Kennedy & Company in New York and successive shows at the
    gallery were so well received that Lewis, like Hopper after his own first
    taste of success, stopped commercial work after 1929.  <br><br>Lewis's
    career was built upon his technical virtuosity in printmaking.  Lewis's
    first interest in printmaking has been tied to his work for the Sydney
    newspaper Bulletin in the 1890s.   While in Australia, he was exposed to
    works of several important etchers, including Australian artist Arthur
    Streeton, as well as Seymour Haden (Whistler's brother-in-law), Rembrandt,
    Charles Meryon, and James A. M. Whistler, but there was no known attempt to
    etch before Lewis reached the United States.  Lewis's first documented
    print, Smoke Pillar, Weehawken, printed in 1915, (see McCarron 1) has enough
    technical skill to argue that this was not the artist's first attempt (he
    was known to have destroyed unsatisfactory impressions).  The same year,
    Lewis encouraged Hopper to take up printmaking and gave him technical
    advice.  After this exchange, Hopper created his own etching Paris Street
    Scene with Carriage, 1915-18 (see Levin 6).  While Lewis would employ
    aquatint and other processes in conjunction with etching, Hopper continued
    to work with only etching and drypoint.  Nevertheless, the two artists would
    use largely the same subject matter and compositional elements, like cutting
    angles and the interplay between light and shadow.  McCarron 70.

    two same-titled 1916 lithographs (see Mason 21 and 22), of which he wrote,
    "A study which started out in a humorous vein but developed into a drama of
    light and dark.  The picture is as interesting upside down.  Gymnastics
    before retiring are supposed to reduce the flesh.  The husband is contented
    with his figure."  When first appearing in The Masses, Socialist magazine
    with art direction by John Sloan, in November 1915, the subject was not
    without controversy.  Art critic Royal Cortissoz claimed that Bellows was
    "dedicated too whole-heartedly to the depiction of what is prosaic in life
    to care a straw about what is poetic, what is beautiful."  Finding small
    vignettes of beauty within the banal, Bellows believed that "there is no
    beauty without strength."  Mason 79.

    began making etchings and drypoints in 1915 with the help of fellow artist
    Martin Lewis (1881-1962), and he produced 70 prints before he ceased etching
    in 1928 to focus solely on painting.  Night Shadows is a particularly iconic
    image, epitomizing Hopper's propensity for conveying isolation and stillness
    through the use of heavy chiaroscuro and strong, dark hatching throughout. 
    He used a bird's-eye vantage point with extended shadows and darkness to
    intensify the suspense and drama. <br><br>The artist depicted this same

  TYPESET: >-
    Drypoint, 1928.  302x252 mm; 11¾x9¾ inches, full margins.  Edition of 111. 
    Signed in pencil, lower right.  A brilliant, luminous impression of this
    important print with richly-inked, velvety burr. <br><br>According to
    McCarron, the location of this scene is at the intersection of Charles
    Street and West Fourth Street in Greenwich Village.  The location of the
    speakeasy alluded to in Lewis's title was on the ground floor of the
    building across the street in the upper left, a space that was later
    occupied by Camilla's Village Garden restaurant. Kennedy Galleries, the
    artist's New York representative for most of his career, changed Lewis's
    (1880-1962) title to Relics, possibly in an attempt to tone down the
    subject. <br><br>Among Lewis's most masterful prints are those depicting
    scenes of New York City life.  These prints have historical interest, as the
    imagery captures the architecture and urban scenery of the time, while
    simultaneously incorporating ephemeral moments.  The time of day, the
    weather, the lighting, the viewpoint--each aspect was important and added to
    the atmosphere of the scene.  Lewis's use of shadows and light to create
    mood, life and movement is most powerful in his New York prints.  Relics is
    his most celebrated etching, incorporating all of the aspects that make his
    prints such cherished glimpses into New York's bustling yester-year, while
    simultaneously capturing the timelessness of city life.<br><br>This was
    Lewis's most popular print during his lifetime too.  He sold out the entire
    intended edition of 100 soon after its completion, and it remains one of his
    most sought after prints today.  <br><br>Lewis had met Edward Hopper
    approximately 15 years after his arrival in the United States in 1900.  The
    two artists shared discontent over their commercial careers.  In 1927, Lewis
    was given a solo exhibition at Kennedy & Company in New York and successive

    to Hopper's Night Shadows, etching, 1921, with Lewis employing a similar
    bird's-eye, nocturnal, urban street view, though Hopper simplified his
    composition with a solitary figure while Lewis populated his scene with
    several disconnected individuals and pairs.  McCarron 74.

    started to etch early in his career, and worked with the same press

    many artists rely on large format support for their abstract works,
    Meyerowitz was able to achieve the same flattened effect and intricate
    patterns using small etching plates, delicate lines, and nuanced technique.

    Marin (1870-1953) may have been invited to provide a cover design for the
    magazine (though there is no published edition of the magazine with this
    cover by Marin), through his connection with Alfred Stieglitz or another
    media contact in New York, though Marin rarely worked in commercial
    illustration.  Other artists who contributed to the short-lived World
    Service of the American Express Company magazine include the prolific
    Hungarian illustrator Willy Pogany (1882-1955) and the American graphic

    widely known for his lyrical prints of Manhattan, was born in Massachusetts
    and traveled the continental United States extensively.  As a young man, he
    moved to New York and enrolled in the Art Students League.  He studied
    printmaking there under Joseph Pennell (1857-1926) who, nearing the end of
    his life, was characterized by his atmospheric cityscape etchings.  Cook's
    interest in the medium increased after a trip to Paris in 1925, where he
    spent time with fellow ex-patriots and master printmakers James E. Allen
    (1894-1964) and Thomas Handforth (1897-1948).<br><br>Cook's career took off
    after a 1926 trip to Maine, when woodcuts he made there were picked up by
    Forum, one of the most widely-circulated American magazines at the time. 
    The publication subsequently commissioned Cook to create woodcuts of the
    American Southwest, where he became enamored with New Mexico and the Taos
    artist's colony, returning throughout his life (he relocated there
    permanently in 1939 and ultimately died in Santa Fe).  By the end of the
    1920s, Cook's adept printmaking caught the interest of Carl Zigrosser
    (1891-1975), the esteemed director of the Weyhe Gallery in New York, who
    supported many emerging artists.  In 1929, Zigrosser both hosted Cook's
    first solo exhibition and encouraged him to travel to Paris, providing him
    entrée into the venerable lithography studio Atelier Desjobert.  Despite
    experimenting in a range of printmaking techniques, the woodcut technique
    remained Cook's medium of choice.<br><br>At the peak of his career, from the
    late 1920s until his 1939 move to New Mexico, Cook feverishly depicted a
    rapidly-changing New York.  Construction on skyscrapers flourished in the
    interwar period, with landmark towers like the Chrysler Building completed
    in 1930 and the Empire State Building completed the following year, while
    the Great Depression halted progress on other projects and construction
    sites remained commonplace.  Cook was employed by the Works Progress
    Administration during this time. Artists like Cook, Louis Lozowick
    (1892-1973) and Samuel Margolies (1897-1974) embraced the evolving city as
    their subject, using exaggerated perspective to emphasize the grandeur of
    buildings, and portraying construction workers as everyday heroes.  Duffy

    (1893-1969) was born in East Hampton, Connecticut and traveled throughout
    the world, using painting to document her itinerary and the people whom she
    met.  She attended the Lasell Female Seminary in Boston from 1913-16 and the
    Hartford Art School before studying at the Art Students League in New York
    under George Bridgeman.  After her marriage in 1922, she made her home in
    France, and painted scenes from her time in Brittany and Paris to show in
    New York, including at Studio Guild and Holt Gallery.  With the onset of
    World War II, Bevin returned to the United States and worked out of her New
    York studio while maintaining residence in her hometown in Connecticut. 
    <br><br>Like her contemporaries of the American Scene, Bevin believed in
    painting not the idyllic country sides, but of the reality of present day. 
    In 1938, with tensions rising in Europe, she wrote "This is not the moment
    to paint a beautiful bouquet of flowers or Paris under snow . . . I cannot
    paint trivial things today when I remember that only one week before the war
    began, I painted a Russian Orthodox church in Helsingfors, which today is
    probably a mass of smouldering ruins."  Bevin's determination to document
    her surroundings combined with imbued soul or sense of tension creates a
    kinship with Hopper and his contemporaries.  In response to her 1939 show at
    Studio Guild, a reviewer wrote in The Art News, "Her particular gift seems
    to lie in her sense of a quiet street, buildings massed together and
    reflected on wet pavements."

    depicting a New York street scene, but also applies Cubist style and leans
    heavily towards abstraction.  Davis was also inspired by Jazz music and the

    (1893-1967), from 1922-29, now in the collection of The Saint Louis Museum
    of Art.<br><br>Burchfield's (1893-1967) works transcend the Regionalist
    label that is often applied to the artist.  He both a realist and
    abstractionist. Though he strived to create a strong sense of human emotion
    and thought in his works, he often did not simply document the reality of
    his surroundings (he lived most of his life in small towns).  Like William
    Zorach and Emil Bisttram, Burchfield saw nature as being endowed with
    mystical and mysterious qualities, which he communicated in his works. 
    <br><br>Burchfield was born in Ashtabula Harbor, Ohio and attended the
    Cleveland School of Art from 1912 to 1916.  He began his career in Buffalo,
    New York working as a wallpaper designer for M. H. Birge & Sons Company.  It
    was during this time period that Burchfield's work was more rooted in
    suburban realism.  Burchfield and Edward Hopper began their friendship in
    1928, after Hopper wrote favorably of Burchfield's work in Arts magazine
    (Burchfield in turn, wrote an essay for Hopper's 1933 retrospective at the
    Museum of Modern Art, New York).  Hopper wrote that Burchfield, "Has
    extracted a quality that we may call poetic, romantic, lyric . . . By
    sympathy with the particular he had made it epic and universal." Like
    Hopper, Burchfield was able to stop working commercially and focus on
    painting full time after finding gallery representation.  In 1929, Frank K.
    M. Rehn Galleries in New York, the same gallery that represented Hopper,
    began showing Burchfield's works.  Through the 1930s, Burchfield was the
    recipient of international recognition; Life magazine declared him one of
    America's greatest painters in December 1936.  In the 1940s, Burchfield's
    works became more spiritual, transcendental and based in nature.

    contrasts.  <br><br>We have found only two other impressions of this etching
    at auction in the past 30 years. <br><br>According to Carl Zigrosser, Hopper
    "does not number his prints and has fixed one hundred as the outside limit
    of impressions taken.  This does not mean that there are one hundred proofs
    of each subject in existence.  The artist prints them as the occasion
    demands.  He has done his own printing except for Night Shadows, where the
    plate was turned over to Peter Platt for the printing of a large edition
    published by the New Republic."<br><br>The conté crayon preparatory drawing
    for this etching is now in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art,
    accession number 1962-30-5a,b.<br><br>Hopper first became interested in
    etching through Charles Meryon's prints of Paris which highlight the city's
    architecture.  After encouragement from friend and fellow artist Martin
    Lewis, Hopper embarked on printmaking in 1915.  The emotional tension in
    Hopper's paintings were soon present in his etchings, much of which were
    completed between 1919 and 1923.  After completing his last etching, The
    Balcony in 1928 and achieving success as an artist, Hopper focused on oils
    and watercolors.  Admittedly, Hopper later recalled, "After I took up
    etching, my painting seemed to crystalize." <br><br>Though Hopper
    (1882-1967) claimed that his etchings, unlike his paintings, were not based
    on a specific observation or model (with the exception of House at
    Tarrytown), their styles are still based in realism with great emotional
    depth.  Intimate, isolated, fleeting moments are conveyed by Hopper's
    deliberate burin on copper plates (he also made some dry points on zinc). 
    Perhaps needing to express a more heightened moodiness in his prints through
    contrast, Hopper sought out the blackest ink on the market to be printed on
    stark white paper.  He wrote to Zigrosser, "The best prints were done on an
    Italian paper called 'Umbria' and was the whitest paper I could get.  The
    ink was an intense black that I sent for to Kimber in London, as I could not
    get an intense enough black here.  I had heard so much of the beauty of old
    paper, but it did not give me the contrast and brilliance that I wanted, and
    I did not use it."  Urban scenes, nocturnes, and train subjects, like in the
    current work, feature largely in Hopper's printed œuvre, a similarity with
    Martin Lewis, while coastal scenes and boats, which are rife in Hopper's
    paintings rarely make an appearance in his etchings, perhaps because they
    lend themselves to high contrast so easily. Not only did Hopper employ his
    materials for visual impact, but also used unusual vantage points, such as
    in Night Shadows, in which the scene is viewed from above.  Lewis, who
    reached his stride by the time Hopper abandoned etching in 1928, drew on
    much of the same subject matter and a heightened sense of drama, qualities
    which went on to characterize the American Scene artists.  Levin 87.

    (1881-1962) had met Edward Hopper approximately 15 years after his arrival
    in the United States in 1900.  The two artists shared discontent over their
    commercial careers.  In 1927, Lewis was given a solo exhibition at Kennedy &
    Company in New York and successive shows at the gallery were so well
    received that Lewis, like Hopper after his own first taste of success,
    stopped commercial work after 1929.  <br><br>Lewis's career was built upon
    his technical virtuosity in printmaking.  Lewis's first interest in
    printmaking has been tied to his work for the Sydney newspaper Bulletin in
    the 1890s.   While in Australia, he was exposed to works of several
    important etchers, including Australian artist Arthur Streeton, as well as
    Seymour Haden (Whistler's brother-in-law), Rembrandt, Charles Meryon, and
    James A. M. Whistler, but there was no known attempt to etch before Lewis
    reached the United States.  Lewis's first documented print, Smoke Pillar,
    Weehawken, printed in 1915, (see McCarron 1) has enough technical skill to
    argue that this was not the artist's first attempt (he was known to have
    destroyed unsatisfactory impressions).  The same year, Lewis encouraged
    Hopper to take up printmaking and gave him technical advice.  After this
    exchange, Hopper created his own etching Paris Street Scene with Carriage,
    1915-18 (see Levin 6).  While Lewis would employ aquatint and other
    processes in conjunction with etching, Hopper continued to work with only
    etching and drypoint.  Nevertheless, the two artists would use largely the
    same subject matter and compositional elements, like cutting angles and the
    interplay between light and shadow.  McCarron 69.

    was part of the second generation of Aschan School artists. Born in
    Columbus, Ohio he worked as a commercial illustrator as a student at The
    Ohio State University from 1901-04.  After Ohio State, he moved to New York
    where he studied with Robert Henri and soon became associated with the
    Aschan artists. He depicted scenes of everyday life in New York that were
    rooted in realism. He started making lithographs in 1916 and revived
    interest in the medium as at the time etching was the preferred printmaking
    method. Lithography gave him a steady stream of income to provide for his
    family and also grew his popularity as an artist.<br><br>In a letter to
    Bellows in 1920, the artist Robert Henri wrote: "I am avoiding the National
    Arts billiard room because I do not think it fair to myself to destroy my
    health by playing in that air before you come.  I will reserve all my vigor
    to use up on playing with you."  Mason 82.

    Vanderwoude, New York; private collection, Chicago.<br><br>Ault (1891-1948)
    was a talented though troubled American artist.  Born in Cleveland, he spent
    his youth in London and studied art there before returning to New York in
    1911.  During the 1920s, following the death of his mother, Ault became an
    alcoholic, each of his three brothers committed suicide, and his family
    fortune was lost following the 1929 stock market crash.  He moved with his
    second wife to Woodstock, New York, in 1937, and worked there the remainder
    of his career.  He and his wife lived in a small rented cottage that had no
    electricity or indoor plumbing.  Though he created many of his finest works
    during this challenging period in Woodstock, he had difficulty selling them
    and failed to gain critical success until after his untimely death in
    December 1948.<br><br>Ault  is often grouped with Precisionist painters such
    as Charles Sheeler (1883-1965) and Ralston Crawford (1906-1978) because of
    his unadorned representations of architecture and urban landscapes.  
    However, the ideological aspects of Precisionism are not so apparent in his
    work.  Much like Edward Hopper (1882-1967), Ault was more of a solitary
    artist.  He painted what he saw around him, simplifying detail slightly into
    flat shapes and planes, and portraying the underlying geometric patterns of
    structures, in this way developing an individual modernist style that
    prefigured Ellsworth Kelly on other Minimalist artists of the later 20th
    century.

    Each a very good impression.<br><br>Walkowitz (1878-1965) was born in
    Tyumen, Siberia to Jewish parents and immigrated to the Lower East Side of
    New York with his mother in 1889.  He was trained in the academic style at
    the National Academy of Design, New York, and also at the Académie Julian in
    Paris, though his style was most influenced by his experiences outside of
    the studio.  Walkowitz's studies in Paris intersected with Edward's Hopper's
    sojourns there at the same time, while Hopper was primarily studying the
    works of the Old Master artists.  During his time in Paris from 1906-07,
    Walkowitz saw Isadora Duncan (1877-1927) dance at Auguste Rodin's
    (1840-1917) Paris studio and made his first drawings of her. He later
    recalled, "She was a Muse.  She had no laws.  She didn't dance according to
    rules.  She created.  Her body was music.  It was a body electric, like Walt
    Whitman."  Like Duncan's dancing, Walkowitz's drawings and watercolors were
    created by quick and spontaneous lines and washes of color.  In Paris,
    Walkowitz was also impressed by the landmark 1907 Paul Cézanne (1839-1906)
    retrospective exhibit at the Salon d'Automne and by his introduction to the
    work of Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and Henri Rousseau (1844-1910).  By the
    time Walkowitz returned to New York, his style was heavily influenced by
    European Modernism, with emphasis on gestures, simplified forms and flat
    planes of bold color.  His first solo exhibition was held at Haas Gallery,
    the back of a modest frame shop, in New York in 1908.<br><br>In 1912,
    Walkowitz met Albert Stieglitz (1864-1946) through Marsden Hartley
    (1877-1943) and became involved with 291, Stieglitz's New York gallery,
    which served as a hub of American modernism.  Stieglitz was so impressed by
    the young artist, that he sent him to study art in Greece, Italy and North
    Africa in 1914.  His style became more abstract; its reduced linear forms
    lent themselves to the city's rush skyward, prematurely anticipating the New
    York School and the Abstract Expressionists.<br><br>In 1913, Walkowitz was
    represented at the Armory Show and in the 1916 Forum exhibition.  Walkowitz
    was concerned with politics and artists' rights and was active in various
    artist's groups, founding the People's Art Guild and the Society of
    Independent Artists (he became director of the latter from 1918 to 1938). 
    In 1920, he exhibited at the Société Anonyme alongside Hartley and Joseph
    Stella (1877-1946).  Despite local and international recognition, Walkowitz
    was not nearly as well-known as his contemporaries.  Walkowitz painted into
    the 1940s, when his eyesight began to fail.

    the scope of their varied careers.  Marguerite was an early exponent of
    modernism in America, born in California into a well-to-do family.  She
    exhibited an interest in art at an early age, and studied at Stanford
    University before traveling to Paris with her aunt, where she was introduced
    to Gertrude Stein and exposed to the work of Henri Matisse. There she
    discovered her affinity for the color palette of the Fauves. Marguerite
    studied for a period of time at the conservative Académie de la Grande
    Chaumière before attending the progressive art school La Palette, where she
    met her future husband, William. Their marriage, in 1912, began a strong
    companionship in which the two artists consistently inspired, influenced and
    shaped each another’s artistic lives.<br><br>Born in 1887 in Lithuania,
    William Zorach immigrated to Cleveland, with his family at age 4. He worked
    as both a sculptor and watercolorist at the vanguard of American modernism,
    after briefly studying in Paris in the early 1910s.  While Zorach initially
    practiced painting, his interests in sculpture, which took root in 1917,
    soon eclipsed all other media.  By the 1930s, Zorach was regarded as one of
    America’s premier sculptors and was honored with multiple commissions and
    exhibitions including shows at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York,
    and the Art Institute of Chicago.

    enrolling at the Art Students League and the New York School of Art under
    William Merritt Chase (1849-1916), with whom Hopper had studied with several
    years previous.  During the 1910s and 1920s, Stella became one of the

    including shows at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and the Art

    lithograph.<br><br>Marguerite Thomas Zorach (1887-1968) and her husband
    William (1887-1966) are renowned for their innovation during the rise of
    American modernism, embodied by their unique blend of Cubism and Fauvism as
    well as the scope of their varied careers.  Marguerite was an early exponent
    of modernism in America, born in California into a well-to-do family.  She
    exhibited an interest in art at an early age, and studied at Stanford
    University before traveling to Paris with her aunt, where she was introduced
    to Gertrude Stein and exposed to the work of Henri Matisse. There she
    discovered her affinity for the color palette of the Fauves. Marguerite
    studied for a period of time at the conservative Académie de la Grande
    Chaumière before attending the progressive art school La Palette, where she
    met her future husband, William. Their marriage, in 1912, began a strong
    companionship in which the two artists consistently inspired, influenced and
    shaped each another’s artistic lives.<br><br>Born in 1887 in Lithuania,
    William Zorach immigrated to Cleveland, with his family at age 4. He worked
    as both a sculptor and watercolorist at the vanguard of American modernism,
    after briefly studying in Paris in the early 1910s.  While Zorach initially
    practiced painting, his interests in sculpture, which took root in 1917,
    soon eclipsed all other media.  By the 1930s, Zorach was regarded as one of
    America’s premier sculptors and was honored with multiple commissions and
    exhibitions including shows at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York,
    and the Art Institute of Chicago.

    first solo exhibition was held in 1926 at the Weyhe Gallery in New York. 
    Like Edward Hopper, Gág's works reveal a disenchantment of the "American
    Dream" between the two world wars and seem to capture a moment in time,
    giving life to inanimate objects when there are no humans present.  Coming
    to New York to attend the Art Students League on a scholarship in 1917, Gág
    began to explore the city's less aesthetic scenes, such as the subway
    stations, further encouraged by her classes with John Sloan.

    League, New York, under the instructors John Sloan, George Luks and Kenneth
    Hayes Miller, among others, and might have been influenced to begin making
    lithographs by the artist Adolf Dehn (1895-1968), with whom she was then
    romantically involved.  Along with her haunting lithographs of scenes in and
    around New York from the 1920s and 1930s, many of which are imbued with an
    eeriness and desolation reminiscent of Hopper, she is also remembered for
    her innovative and modern children's books, consisting of stories she told
    her younger siblings when growing up and illustrated herself, including
    Millions of Cats, Gone is Gone and The ABC Bunny.  Winnan 62.

    (1893-1967) works transcend the Regionalist label that is often applied to
    the artist.  He both a realist and abstractionist. Though he strived to
    create a strong sense of human emotion and thought in his works, he often
    did not simply document the reality of his surroundings (he lived most of
    his life in small towns).  Like William Zorach and Emil Bisttram, Burchfield
    saw nature as being endowed with mystical and mysterious qualities, which he
    communicated in his works.  <br><br>Burchfield was born in Ashtabula Harbor,
    Ohio and attended the Cleveland School of Art from 1912 to 1916.  He began
    his career in Buffalo, New York working as a wallpaper designer for M. H.
    Birge & Sons Company.  It was during this time period that Burchfield's work
    was more rooted in suburban realism.  Burchfield and Edward Hopper began
    their friendship in 1928, after Hopper wrote favorably of Burchfield's work
    in Arts magazine (Burchfield in turn, wrote an essay for Hopper's 1933
    retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, New York).  Hopper wrote that
    Burchfield, "Has extracted a quality that we may call poetic, romantic,
    lyric . . . By sympathy with the particular he had made it epic and
    universal." Like Hopper, Burchfield was able to stop working commercially
    and focus on painting full time after finding gallery representation.  In
    1929, Frank K. M. Rehn Galleries in New York, the same gallery that
    represented Hopper, began showing Burchfield's works.  Through the 1930s,
    Burchfield was the recipient of international recognition; Life magazine
    declared him one of America's greatest painters in December 1936.  In the
    1940s, Burchfield's works became more spiritual, transcendental and based in
    nature.

    artist, Connecticut; Eugénie van Kemmel Prendergast, the artist's widow; the
    Society of the Four Arts, Palm Beach; private collection, New Jersey.
    <br><br>The current work is registered with the Williams College Museum of
    Art, Prendergast Collection, Williamstown, with a letter of authenticity,
    dated August 11, 2005. <br><br>Artist brothers Maurice (1858-1924) and
    Charles Prendergast (1863-1948) were born in Newfoundland and moved to
    Boston as children.  Both studied fine art in Paris in 1891 and by 1894,
    were living together in Boston, Charles making his career primarily as a
    framer and Maurice as an artist.  Maurice modelled his work after the French
    avant-garde and exhibited with The Eight in New York in 1908 and at the
    landmark 1913 Armory Show.  Charles was influenced by the Arts and Crafts
    movement and New England folk art.  In 1915, Maurice and Charles exhibited
    together for the first time in New York at Montross Gallery.  They continued
    to exhibit together with the Society of Independent Artists, where Charles
    was elected vice president in 1917.  The Society, founded in New York in
    1916, filled the void caused by the dissolution of the Association of
    American Painters and Sculptors after the Armory Show was mounted in 1913. 
    It was based on the French Société des Artistes Indépendants with the
    mission of promoting avant-garde artists with annual exhibitions.  Unlike
    the conservative National Academy of Design, membership in the Society was
    open to any artist able to pay a fee and annual dues.  Among its other
    founders were Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, Katherine Dreier, William Glackens,
    Rockwell Kent, John Marin, Walter Pach, John Sloan and Joseph Stella.  Its
    first exhibition, held at the Grand Central Palace in New York in April
    1917, was twice the size of the Armory Show, and espoused the democratic
    ideal of accessible arts.

    Signed in oil, lower right recto.  <br><br>Provenance: Ella Lerner Gallery,
    Lenox, Massachusetts and New York; private collection,
    Maryland.<br><br>Stella (1877-1946) was born to a middle-class family in
    Muro Lucano, Italy.  He moved to New York in 1896 to study medicine, but he
    quickly eschewed his medical ambitions when he discovered his passion for
    art, enrolling at the Art Students League and studying at the New York
    School of Art under William Merritt Chase (1849-1916).  Stella worked as an
    illustrator from 1905 to 1908 and was also active in the Federal Art Project
    during the 1930s, however it is his avant-garde works for which he is today
    best known, including colorful, fanciful floral studies, like the current
    work, ethereal landscapes, and modernist city depictions.  His Futurist oil
    painting Battle of Lights, Coney Island, Mardi Gras, 1913, was exhibited in
    the 1913 Armory Show and caused a sensation.  Collector and art educator
    Katherine Dreier included Stella among those artists whose work she sought
    to promote under the auspices of her Société Anonyme, New York's first
    museum dedicated exclusively to advanced contemporary art, which opened its
    doors in 1920 (she acquired Battle of Lights, Coney Island, Mardi Gras and
    it is now in the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven). 
    Like John Marin, Stella became fascinated with the geometric quality of the
    architecture of Lower Manhattan.  During the 1920s he also began to make
    collages consisting of scraps of discarded paper, wrappers (some with the
    commercial logo or label still visible), and other bits of urban debris. 
    Stella's works from the 1920s onward, however, were problematic for the
    cultivation of a sustained career.  Once he had ceased painting in a
    Futurist or quasi-Cubist mode and had finished with his period of
    Precisionist factory images (circa 1920), he was not aligned with any
    particular movement.  Even his retrospective at the Newark Museum, New
    Jersey in 1939 failed to reestablish him and his work was underappreciated
    at mid-century prior to being prized again in recent decades.

    York, circa 1987; private collection, New York. <br><br>Silverpoint, linked
    Stella (1877-1946) to the Old Masters and allowed him to attain thin, light
    capturing lines.  The medium was rarely used, as it requires precise
    handling (it cannot be erased) and an abrasive ground.  Stella used zinc
    white gouache to prepare his paper which also gave the illusion that his
    subjects floated in space.  Stella's botanical drawings, in which he gives
    life to, or anthropomorphizes, inanimate objects, are linked to his 1919 oil
    on canvas Tree of My Life (now in the collection of Art Bridges, Texas),
    though he continued to create these drawings throughout his career.  In
    1946, he remembered fondly, "From 1921 on I was swinging as a pendulum from
    one subject to the opposite one.  With sheer delight I was roaming through
    different fields, spurred by the inciting expectation of finding thrilling
    surprises, especially going through the luxuriant garden of the Bronx, I was
    seized with a sensual thrill in cutting with the sharpness of my silverpoint
    the terse purity of the lotus leaves or the matchless stem of a strange
    tropical plant.  Innumerable visions of pictures were storming around me
    like chimeric butterflies."

    Adopting a bold new style, Hartley exhibited with the avant-garde Der Blaue
    Reiter group in 1913.  He revisited Berlin in 1914, producing his most
    iconic works of the War Motif series, following the death of his purported
    romantic partner, a German World War I soldier named Karl von Freyburg. 
    These paintings are comprised of bold, sweeping colors, German insignia and
    undulating flattened shapes.<br><br>Ingenious and innovative, Hartley drew
    from the two-dimensionality of the Cubists and the spiritualism, raw emotion
    and subjectivity of the Expressionists. Hartley traveled around the world
    throughout his career, often deeply embedding himself in his surroundings. 
    His works slowly became less abstract as his career advanced. University of

    verso. <br><br>Provenance: Margaret V. and Samuel A. Lewisohn, New York;
    thence by descent to current owner, private collection, New
    York.<br><br>Demuth (1883-1935) was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and
    suffered an injury as a child that forced him to walk with a cane.  As he
    was unable to be as physically active as other children, his mother gave him
    crayons to draw with.  His parents supported his art from a young age and he
    attended Franklin and Marshall College, Drexel University and the
    Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia.  After leaving school, he
    focused on his preferred medium of watercolor and found inspiration in
    flowers and plants in his mother's garden, a subject that would preoccupy
    him throughout his life.<br><br>Demuth made his studio at his home in
    Lancaster, but traveled frequently and made many important friends in the
    artistic community.  He traveled three times to Paris where he studied at
    the Académie Colarossi and Académie Julian, joined the avant-garde artistic
    scene, and admired the work of European modernists, even spending time at
    Gertrude Stein's salon.  He met Marsden Hartley while in Paris who later
    introduced him to Alfred Stieglitz and became part of his tightknit group of
    artists.<br><br>While well-traveled, most of his work was created in his
    studio in Lancaster.  Demuth eventually embraced a Precisionist style,
    focusing on geometric forms and industrial subject matter.  He also returned
    to flowers, plants and vegetables consistently throughout his career,
    focusing with technical virtuosity and deft handling on their color and
    form.

    Bumpei Usui (1898–1994); private collection, Tokyo. <br><br>After arriving
    in the United States in 1921 and settling in New York, Bumpei Usui started
    out as a framer for Reginald Marsh (1898-1954) and Kuniyoshi (1889-1953)
    while establishing himself in the art world as a painter. Kuniyoshi became
    Usui's informal mentor and the two had a deep friendship throughout their
    lives.  Usui's 1930 oil on canvas portrait of Kuniyoshi is held by the
    Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.<br><br>Born in Okayama,
    Japan, Kuniyoshi attended the Los Angeles School of Art and Design before
    moving to New York to ultimately study at the Art Student's League from
    1916-20 (he briefly studied also with Robert Henri at the National
    Academy).  He began to exhibit with the Penguin Club, an informal artists
    group founded by Walt Kuhn in 1917 to rebel against the stringent National
    Academy, which counted Guy Pène du Bois, Arthur B. Davies, Edward Hopper,
    Jules Pascin, Joseph Stella and Max Weber as its affiliated artists.  Though
    short lived, the club was only active until 1920, it sponsored social
    events, exhibitions, auctions and sketch classes.  Kuniyoshi remembered,
    "This small but fertile group helped establish the roots of contemporary
    American painting.  Considered the rebels of their time, they waged a
    vigorous battle against conservatism with might and humor.  We knew how to
    play and enjoy ourselves in those days."  This humor and playfulness are
    clearly evident in Kuniyoshi's works, though there is also a sense of
    political awareness.  As in the present work, the appearance of newspapers
    signifies Kuniyoshi's reaction to contemporary violence and upheavals
    through the 1940s.  <br><br>Finding success in New York, Kuniyoshi had his
    first solo exhibition at the Daniel Gallery and was soon exhibiting
    internationally in Europe and Japan through the 1930s.  He travelled to
    Mexico in 1935 on a Guggenheim Fellowship and frequently summered in
    Woodstock, New York.  Like several of his contemporaries, Kuniyoshi returned
    to the Art Students League as a teacher, a position that he would hold from
    1933 to his death in 1953.

    (1890-1972), alongside Stuart Davis and Max Weber, was one of the proponents
    of the nascent American Cubism style.  He was born in Czechoslovakia and
    studied fine art in Prague before immigrating to the United States in 1907. 
    He enrolled at the National Academy of Design and in 1917 won the Pulitzer
    Traveling Scholarship, which he used to fund trips to the American southwest
    and Europe.  Works from his time in Europe reflect influences by Paul
    Cézanne and early Cubism, striking a balance between realism and geometric
    abstraction.  Later in his career, Matulka would explore Surrealism and
    Expressionism.  During the Great Depression, Matulka worked for the WPA's
    Federal Art Project and supported himself by teaching at the Art Student's
    League (instructing students such as Burgoyne Diller, Dorothy Dehner and
    David Smith).  Matulka brought different elements of European Modernism to
    the United States and to his students, though this style fell out of favor
    in light of the new American Scene style and socially inspired themes.  Like
    Edward Hopper and many of their contemporaries, Matulka exhibited with the
    Whitney Studio Club in New York during the 1920s.

    traveled to Paris just in time to view a major Paul Cézanne retrospective,

    style that is best summed up as modern social realism: depictions of
    everyday life in New York, Coney Island beach scenes, vaudeville and
    burlesque women, the jobless on the streets of New York and the railroad
    yards and freight trains in New York and New Jersey.  Sasowsky 143.

    Signed and dated in gouache, lower right recto, and titled and annotated in
    pencil, verso.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection,
    Chicago.<br><br>According to the Cleveland Museum of Art, which has a
    significant holding of works by Carter (1904-2000), including a color
    aquatint of Railroad Avenue, 1931, perhaps related to the current work, the
    artist was one of Cleveland’s most imaginative interpreters of the American
    scene.  Carter was born in Portsmouth, Ohio, and developed a love of drawing
    at an early age.  Encouraged by his family, he took private watercolor
    lessons and won art prizes in county and state fairs in his early teens.  He
    studied with William Eastman, Henry Keller, and Paul Travis at the Cleveland
    School of Art, 1923–27.  He exhibited in the annual May Shows at the
    Cleveland Museum of Art (1927–39).  In 1927 William Milliken, then curator
    of paintings at the art museum, organized a subscription scholarship to
    allow Carter two years of travel through Italy, Switzerland, England and
    France.  In the summer of 1927, he studied in Capri with Hans Hofmann.  On
    returning to Cleveland in 1929, Carter had his first solo exhibition at the
    Cleveland Art Center.  He taught studio classes at the Cleveland Museum of
    Art, 1930–37.  In 1934, under the auspices of the Public Works of Art
    Project, the first of the New Deal art programs, Carter was commissioned to
    paint two murals for the Cleveland Public Auditorium.  For a subsequent
    governmental art program, the Works Progress Administration, he served as a
    district supervisor for painting projects in north east Ohio.  After 1935 he
    completed two federal mural commissions: one for the post office in Ravenna,
    Ohio, and another for the post office in his hometown.  In 1938 he moved to
    Pittsburgh to teach at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now
    Carnegie-Mellon University).  During the 1930s and 1940s he showed in annual
    exhibitions in Philadelphia, New York City, Chicago and Washington, D.C.

    was not until 1929 that he started working in lithography with George Pearse
    Ennis at the Eastport Summer School.  He published his first lithographs in
    1931 and it soon became his preferred medium.  He became one of the most
    accomplished American lithographers of the 20th century, leading the great
    American realist painter, Andrew Wyeth (1917-2009), to praise Wengenroth as,
    "America's greatest living artist working in black and white." While most of
    Wengenroth's 350-plus lithographs feature landscape and natural scenery of
    the eastern Atlantic coast, he returned to his New York roots for some of
    his most prized prints.

    Miller, in deep appreciation of his helpfulness and excellent printing" in

    "printer" in pencil, lower left.   A superb, richly-inked and luminous
    impression of this scarce lithograph.<br><br>Cook (1901-1980), most widely
    known for his lyrical prints of Manhattan, was born in Massachusetts and
    traveled the continental United States extensively.  As a young man, he
    moved to New York and enrolled in the Art Students League.  He studied
    printmaking there under Joseph Pennell (1857-1926) who, nearing the end of
    his life, was characterized by his atmospheric cityscape etchings.  Cook's
    interest in the medium increased after a trip to Paris in 1925, where he
    spent time with fellow ex-patriots and master printmakers James E. Allen
    (1894-1964) and Thomas Handforth (1897-1948).<br><br>Cook's career took off
    after a 1926 trip to Maine, when woodcuts he made there were picked up by
    Forum, one of the most widely-circulated American magazines at the time. 
    The publication subsequently commissioned Cook to create woodcuts of the
    American Southwest, where he became enamored with New Mexico and the Taos
    artist's colony, returning throughout his life (he relocated there
    permanently in 1939 and ultimately died in Santa Fe).  By the end of the
    1920s, Cook's adept printmaking caught the interest of Carl Zigrosser
    (1891-1975), the esteemed director of the Weyhe Gallery in New York, who
    supported many emerging artists.  In 1929, Zigrosser both hosted Cook's
    first solo exhibition and encouraged him to travel to Paris, providing him
    entrée into the venerable lithography studio Atelier Desjobert.  Despite
    experimenting in a range of printmaking techniques, the woodcut technique
    remained Cook's medium of choice.<br><br>At the peak of his career, from the
    late 1920s until his 1939 move to New Mexico, Cook feverishly depicted a
    rapidly-changing New York.  Construction on skyscrapers flourished in the
    interwar period, with landmark towers like the Chrysler Building completed
    in 1930 and the Empire State Building completed the following year, while
    the Great Depression halted progress on other projects and construction
    sites remained commonplace.  Cook was employed by the Works Progress
    Administration during this time. Artists like Cook, Louis Lozowick
    (1892-1973) and Samuel Margolies (1897-1974) embraced the evolving city as
    their subject, using exaggerated perspective to emphasize the grandeur of
    buildings, and portraying construction workers as everyday heroes.  Duffy

    Edward Hopper, Hoover (1888-1955) had also supported himself as a commercial
    illustrator.  Though Hopper disliked this line of work, once claiming that,
    "Illustrating was a depressing experience.  And I didn't get very good
    prices because I didn't often do what they wanted," Hoover found his work
    more fulfilling, becoming a syndicated cartoonist while also enjoying a
    reputation as an accomplished fine artist and printmaker.  <br><br>Hoover
    was born in Cleveland and studied at the Cleveland School of Art and the Art
    Students League in New York.  There are stylistic parallels between Hoover
    and Hopper, in a 1950 review of Hoover's Parisian scenes, Margaret Breuning
    for The Art Digest commented that they, "Seize the feel of place so
    trenchantly that they are nostalgic.  They are little vignettes of different
    phases of the city's life, only slightly stressing architectural setting. 
    With a few deft touches of color and surety of line the artist weaves,
    through one vivid incident, a whole pattern of life and living."

    Washington, D.C., wrote that the artist was "in such harmony with his medium

    printed line with clarity, without hesitation, and with a feeling of
    discerning and sensitive as it is forthright."  <br><br>Borne was born in

    of American Etchers in 1939.  In 1950, Borne and his wife moved from

    brother again to New York in 1906 where he settled in New Jersey, got a job
    at a factory, and learned English. He continued his studies, at the National
    Academy of Design, taking courses with Emil Carlsen and Leon Kroll. They
    pushed Lozowick to seek a personal viewpoint in his artwork beyond the
    traditional training. He took a break from making art while he was a student
    at Ohio State University and joined the army during World War I.<br><br>The
    modern European art movements had a profound effect on Lozowick, and between
    1920 and 1924 he traveled to Europe and spent time meeting modern artists
    and enmeshing himself into artistic and cultural communities. He was

    European movements while choosing specifically American subject matter was
    typical of Precisionism, and while artists like Charles Sheeler and Ralston
    Crawford never organized, they shared the approach of paring down their
    compositions to the simplest of forms. After the fall of the stock market
    and as the country turned towards despair in the 1930s, Lozowick adapted his
    concept of the city. Along with many artists, he turned toward depicting the
    social reality of its residents who were affected by the Depression.
    Throughout his career, New York remained his primary subject matter, and he
    reflected in 1943, “From the innumerable choices which our complex and
    tradition-laden civilization presents to the artist, I have chosen one which
    seems to suit my training and temperament. I might characterize it this:
    ‘Industry harnessed by Man for the Benefit of Mankind.’”<br><br>Lozowick
    (1892-1973) was one of the first artists to make a screenprint for the WPA,
    New York, and this is his only extant print in the medium.<br><br>We have

    approximately 15 years after his arrival in the United States in 1900.  The
    two artists shared discontent over their commercial careers.  In 1927, Lewis
    was given a solo exhibition at Kennedy & Company in New York and successive
    shows at the gallery were so well received that Lewis, like Hopper after his
    own first taste of success, stopped commercial work after 1929. 
    <br><br>Lewis's career was built upon his technical virtuosity in
    printmaking.  Lewis's first interest in printmaking has been tied to his
    work for the Sydney newspaper Bulletin in the 1890s.   While in Australia,
    he was exposed to works of several important etchers, including Australian
    artist Arthur Streeton, as well as Seymour Haden (Whistler's
    brother-in-law), Rembrandt, Charles Meryon, and James A. M. Whistler, but
    there was no known attempt to etch before Lewis reached the United States. 
    Lewis's first documented print, Smoke Pillar, Weehawken, printed in 1915,
    (see McCarron 1) has enough technical skill to argue that this was not the
    artist's first attempt (he was known to have destroyed unsatisfactory
    impressions).  The same year, Lewis encouraged Hopper to take up printmaking
    and gave him technical advice.  After this exchange, Hopper created his own
    etching Paris Street Scene with Carriage, 1915-18 (see Levin 6).  While
    Lewis would employ aquatint and other processes in conjunction with etching,
    Hopper continued to work with only etching and drypoint.  Nevertheless, the
    two artists would use largely the same subject matter and compositional
    elements, like cutting angles and the interplay between light and shadow.

    the 1890s.   While in Australia, he was exposed to works of several
    important etchers, including Australian artist Arthur Streeton, as well as
    Seymour Haden (Whistler's brother-in-law), Rembrandt, Charles Meryon, and
    James A. M. Whistler, but there was no known attempt to etch before Lewis
    reached the United States.  Lewis's first documented print, Smoke Pillar,
    Weehawken, printed in 1915, (see McCarron 1) has enough technical skill to
    argue that this was not the artist's first attempt (he was known to have
    destroyed unsatisfactory impressions).  The same year, Lewis encouraged
    Hopper to take up printmaking and gave him technical advice.  After this
    exchange, Hopper created his own etching Paris Street Scene with Carriage,
    1915-18 (see Levin 6).  While Lewis would employ aquatint and other
    processes in conjunction with etching, Hopper continued to work with only
    etching and drypoint.  Nevertheless, the two artists would use largely the
    same subject matter and compositional elements, like cutting angles and the
    interplay between light and shadow.  McCarron 125.

    Signed and dated in pencil, lower right margin.  A very good impression of
    this extremely scarce lithograph.<br><br><br><br>Lozowick (1892-1973) was
    born in Ludvinovka, a small village near Kiev and moved to the larger city
    of Kiev with his brother as a child. He studied at the Kiev Art School
    before following his brother again to New York in 1906 where he settled in
    New Jersey, got a job at a factory, and learned English. He continued his
    studies, at the National Academy of Design, taking courses with Emil Carlsen
    and Leon Kroll. They pushed Lozowick to seek a personal viewpoint in his
    artwork beyond the traditional training. He took a break from making art
    while he was a student at Ohio State University and joined the army during
    World War I.<br><br>The modern European art movements had a profound effect
    on Lozowick, and between 1920 and 1924 he traveled to Europe and spent time
    meeting modern artists and enmeshing himself into artistic and cultural
    communities. He was particularly drawn to Cubist and Futurist styles, and in
    1923, when he was introduced to lithography, he applied their principles to
    American subject matter.<br><br>Lozowick was among a small group of artists,
    including Jan Matulka and Howard Cook, who depicted the industrial city.
    Embracing these European movements while choosing specifically American
    subject matter was typical of Precisionism, and while artists like Charles
    Sheeler and Ralston Crawford never organized, they shared the approach of
    paring down their compositions to the simplest of forms. After the fall of
    the stock market and as the country turned towards despair in the 1930s,
    Lozowick adapted his concept of the city. Along with many artists, he turned
    toward depicting the social reality of its residents who were affected by
    the Depression. Throughout his career, New York remained his primary subject
    matter, and he reflected in 1943, “From the innumerable choices which our
    complex and tradition-laden civilization presents to the artist, I have
    chosen one which seems to suit my training and temperament. I might
    characterize it this: ‘Industry harnessed by Man for the Benefit of
    Mankind.’”   Flint 56.

    estate ink stamp, twice lower right recto, twice verso.<br><br>Provenance:
    Estate of the artist, New York; private collection, Chicago.<br><br>Stella
    (1877-1946) was born to a middle-class family in Muro Lucano, Italy.  He
    moved to New York in 1896 to study medicine, but he quickly eschewed his
    medical ambitions when he discovered his passion for art, enrolling at the
    Art Students League and studying at the New York School of Art under William
    Merritt Chase (1849-1916).  Stella worked as an illustrator from 1905 to
    1908 and was also active in the Federal Art Project during the 1930s,
    however it is his avant-garde works for which he is today best known,
    including colorful, fanciful floral studies, like the current work, ethereal
    landscapes, and modernist city depictions.  His Futurist oil painting Battle
    of Lights, Coney Island, Mardi Gras, 1913, was exhibited in the 1913 Armory
    Show and caused a sensation.  Collector and art educator Katherine Dreier
    included Stella among those artists whose work she sought to promote under
    the auspices of her Société Anonyme, New York's first museum dedicated
    exclusively to advanced contemporary art, which opened its doors in 1920
    (she acquired Battle of Lights, Coney Island, Mardi Gras and it is now in
    the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven).  Like John
    Marin, Stella became fascinated with the geometric quality of the
    architecture of Lower Manhattan.  During the 1920s he also began to make
    collages consisting of scraps of discarded paper, wrappers (some with the
    commercial logo or label still visible), and other bits of urban debris. 
    Stella's works from the 1920s onward, however, were problematic for the
    cultivation of a sustained career.  Once he had ceased painting in a
    Futurist or quasi-Cubist mode and had finished with his period of
    Precisionist factory images (circa 1920), he was not aligned with any
    particular movement.  Even his retrospective at the Newark Museum, New
    Jersey in 1939 failed to reestablish him and his work was underappreciated
    at mid-century prior to being prized again in recent decades.

    American Painters and Sculptors who organized the Armory Show and was in

    drawing, signed and dated in ink, verso.<br><br>Provenance: Private
    collection, New York.<br><br>The current work, painted near the artist's
    studio and home in Brandywine, Ohio, is characteristic of Sommer's
    (1867-1949) mature style, with its flattened perspective and generous use of
    concentrated pigments.  Sommer's work typically takes on abstract
    characteristics, though consistently emote restlessness and spontaneity. 
    Sommer projected influences of Paul Gauguin and Paul Cézanne on to his
    thoroughly American subjects, Brandywine landscapes and local portraits. 
    <br><br>Sommer was born in Detroit and from 1878 to 1883 studied drawing
    locally under sculptor and lithographer Julius Melchers.  After apprenticing
    at the Detroit Calvert Lithograph Company, Sommer worked in lithography at
    the Bufford Company in Boston, the Ottman Company in New York, and at the
    Dangerfield Brothers Printing Company in London.  After studying in Munich
    with intermittent travels through Europe, Sommer returned to New York. 
    Influenced by early German Expressionism, Sommer joined the American Kit Kat
    Club, which provided life drawing models, akin to the Whitney Studio Club. 
    In 1907 Sommer followed his printmaking work to the Otis Lithography Company
    in Cleveland, where he began a friendship with William Zorach and founded
    the Kokoon Art Club.  In 1914, Sommer and his wife Martha purchased their
    property in Brandywine where he set up his studio in an old schoolhouse,
    working as an artist, muralist, and theater production designer.   Finding
    himself without work during the Great Depression, Sommer worked first under
    the auspices of the Public Works of Art Project, the Works Progress
    Administration, and then the Treasury Art Project, the most notable project
    being a mural he completed for Brett Hall in the Cleveland Public Library.

    Company in New York and successive shows at the gallery were so well
    received that Lewis, like Hopper after his own first taste of success,
    stopped commercial work after 1929.  <br><br>Lewis's career was built upon
    his technical virtuosity in printmaking.  Lewis's first interest in

    reputation as an artist once she was married in 1906.  In 1917, she
    separated from her husband and resumed painting, joining the Whitney Studio
    Club in New York.  With the encouragement of Carl Zigrosser, who often urged
    American artists to make a pilgrimage to the Atelier Desjobert, she traveled
    to Paris in 1927 to learn lithography.  He said of her, "Dwight did not just
    skim the surface of the comic and incongruous, but probed into the depths,
    ever imbued with pity and compassion, a sense of irony, and the
    understanding that comes of profound experience... There is detachment also,
    the sense of seeing life from afar, the long view of things."  After
    returning to New York, her mature style blossomed, blending social realist
    subjects with her unique brand of satire.  In 1928, she produced her first
    American lithographs and printed 17 works in collaboration with George
    Miller.  She went on to produce lithographs for the Federal Arts Projects
    during the Great Depression.

    lithograph and the same-titled 1932 oil on Masonite painting (present
    location unknown) is based upon were inspired by the artist's morning
    commute from Brooklyn to her studio in Union Square.  As she recalled "I'd
    see something I would almost be sorry because I had to sketch it... I always
    had a feeling that this guy was goosing her... but she was liking it." 
    Women had found independence during the 1920s and, subsequently, had seen
    these strides reversed during the downturn of the Great Depression.  This
    composition is also tied to the highly publicized and long drawn out case of
    the "Scottsboro Boys," nine black teenagers arrested and tried in
    Scottsboro, Arizona for allegedly raping two white women on a train in
    1931.  In the 1932 painting, the black man to the left of the woman holds a
    newspaper referencing the case, Citron depicting him in a dignified manner,
    contrary to the typical caricatures seen during the 1920s and 1930s.

    Signed, dated and inscribed "45 p" in pencil, lower margin.  Printed by
    George Miller, New York.  A very good impression of this scarce
    lithograph.<br><br>Born in Okayama, Japan, Kuniyoshi attended the Los
    Angeles School of Art and Design before moving to New York to ultimately
    study at the Art Student's League from 1916-20 (he briefly studied also with
    Robert Henri at the National Academy).  He began to exhibit with the Penguin
    Club, an informal artists group founded by Walt Kuhn in 1917 to rebel
    against the stringent National Academy, which counted Guy Pène du Bois,
    Arthur B. Davies, Edward Hopper, Jules Pascin, Joseph Stella and Max Weber
    as its affiliated artists.  Though short lived, the club was only active
    until 1920, it sponsored social events, exhibitions, auctions and sketch
    classes.  Kuniyoshi remembered, "This small but fertile group helped
    establish the roots of contemporary American painting.  Considered the
    rebels of their time, they waged a vigorous battle against conservatism with
    might and humor.  We knew how to play and enjoy ourselves in those days." 
    This humor and playfulness are clearly evident in Kuniyoshi's works, though
    there is also a sense of political awareness.  As in the present work, the
    appearance of newspapers signifies Kuniyoshi's reaction to contemporary
    violence and upheavals through the 1940s.  <br><br>Finding success in New
    York, Kuniyoshi had his first solo exhibition at the Daniel Gallery and was
    soon exhibiting internationally in Europe and Japan through the 1930s.  He
    travelled to Mexico in 1935 on a Guggenheim Fellowship and frequently
    summered in Woodstock, New York.  Like several of his contemporaries,
    Kuniyoshi returned to the Art Students League as a teacher, a position that
    he would hold from 1933 to his death in 1953.  Davis 70.

    Edition of 60 (from an intended edition of 100). Signed and inscribed "100
    proofs" in pencil, lower margin. A superb impression with strong contrasts
    and warm plate tone.<br><br>According to Morse, approximately 30 impressions
    were pulled from the plate in the seventh state and another 30 were taken in
    the eighth state, which differs in the heavy diagonal shading in the plate
    upper right, to account for the total published edition of 60. <br><br>Sloan
    (1871-1951) made this portrait as a memorial to his teacher, mentor and
    friend, fellow  Ashcan artist Robert Henri (1865-1929).  Henri had died
    unexpectedly, after being hospitalized at St. Luke's Hospital in New York,
    of cardiac arrest early in the morning of July 12, 1929.  His sudden death
    had a strong impact on the scores of artists he had taught and mentored for
    several decades, including Sloan, George Bellows, Rockwell Kent, Stuart
    Davis and Edward Hopper.  The artist and student of Henri,  Eugene Speicher
    said, "Not only was he a great painter, but . . . I don't think it too much
    to call him the father of independent painting in this
    country."<br><br>Sloan based the current work, one of his largest portrait
    etchings, on a drawing he had made of Henri in 1905, now in the collection
    of the Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery, University of Nebraska, Lincoln.  In
    his diary, Sloan noted, "I am pleased with the plate and hope that it
    conveys some of the kindly strength and helpful wisdom which this great
    artists so freely gave toothers."  Morse 246.

    du Bois (1884-1958), born in Brooklyn, spent his childhood on Staten Island
    and attended the New York School of Art as a student of Robert Henri and
    classmate of George Bellows, Edward Hopper, Rockwell Kent, Walter Pach, and
    Gifford Beal.   Henri advocated for faithful depictions of urbanites,
    usually done quickly (as a newspaper illustrator would) and picking up the
    threads of his subjects' anecdotes.   A promising young artist, Pène du Bois
    studied for a short time in Paris and exhibited at a Salon in 1905.  He
    returned to New York in the summer of 1906 and started work as a reporter
    for the New York American, eventually becoming an art critic for the
    publication.  During his career as a writer, he would also contribute to
    Arts and Decoration, the New York Post, International Studio, Creative Art,
    and Arts Weekly.  Pène du Bois established himself as an artist in the
    1910's and was one of the founding members of the Whitney Studio Club in New
    York in 1918.  As part of his work for the Club, he arranged his very close
    lifelong friend, Hopper's first exhibition in 1920.  As an extension of his
    successful painting and writing, he became a well-respected curator, juror,
    and teacher. <br><br>The foundation of Pène du Bois's mature style is
    Henri's philosophy of accessibility and urban realism, from which he
    subtracted the Ashcan style anecdotal narrative and added his own
    imagination and ambiguity.  His glamorous subjects are not to be envied, as
    they are frequently detached, either psychologically or physically isolated
    in an almost satirical way.

  TYPESET: >-
    Pencil on wove paper, circa 1930.  355x254 mm; 14x10 inches.  Annotated in
    pencil, upper right and lower center recto.<br><br>Provenance: Raydon
    Gallery, New York; private collection, Chicago.<br><br>A portrait study of
    Burchfield's (1893-1967) daughter Mary Alice, who was born in Buffalo in
    1923, lived in Chicago and upstate New York, and died in 1988 in Los
    Angeles.  This appears to be a preliminary study for Burchfield's Portrait
    Study in Spring Landscape, watercolor, charcoal and pencil on paper,
    1930-60, now in the Burchfield Penney Art Center at Buffalo State College. 
    The watercolor shows the artist's daughter, seated on a log and holding a
    flower, in a verdant spring landscape.  Around her head is a golden aura,
    which is called for in the artist's pencil notes on the current
    drawing.<br><br>Burchfield's (1893-1967) works transcend the Regionalist
    label that is often applied to the artist.  He both a realist and
    abstractionist. Though he strived to create a strong sense of human emotion
    and thought in his works, he often did not simply document the reality of
    his surroundings (he lived most of his life in small towns).  Like William
    Zorach and Emil Bisttram, Burchfield saw nature as being endowed with
    mystical and mysterious qualities, which he communicated in his works. 
    <br><br>Burchfield was born in Ashtabula Harbor, Ohio and attended the
    Cleveland School of Art from 1912 to 1916.  He began his career in Buffalo,
    New York working as a wallpaper designer for M. H. Birge & Sons Company.  It
    was during this time period that Burchfield's work was more rooted in
    suburban realism.  Burchfield and Edward Hopper began their friendship in
    1928, after Hopper wrote favorably of Burchfield's work in Arts magazine
    (Burchfield in turn, wrote an essay for Hopper's 1933 retrospective at the
    Museum of Modern Art, New York).  Hopper wrote that Burchfield, "Has
    extracted a quality that we may call poetic, romantic, lyric . . . By
    sympathy with the particular he had made it epic and universal." Like
    Hopper, Burchfield was able to stop working commercially and focus on
    painting full time after finding gallery representation.  In 1929, Frank K.
    M. Rehn Galleries in New York, the same gallery that represented Hopper,
    began showing Burchfield's works.  Through the 1930s, Burchfield was the
    recipient of international recognition; Life magazine declared him one of
    America's greatest painters in December 1936.  In the 1940s, Burchfield's
    works became more spiritual, transcendental and based in nature.

    lithograph.<br><br>Perhaps more than any other American artist returning
    from Paris in the first decade of the 20th century, Weber (1881-1961), an
    avid student of art history who possessed a critical eye for the
    avant-garde, skillfully incorporated the new directions of French modern art
    into his work.  Weber absorbed the primitivism of his good friend, the
    self-taught artist Henri Rousseau, the early Cubism of Georges Braque and
    Pablo Picasso and the Fauvism of Henri Matisse and Émile Othon
    Frieze.<br><br>Born in Poland and emigrating to Brooklyn at the age of ten,
    Weber studied at the Pratt Institute under pioneering modernist teacher,
    Arthur Wesley Dow, who was also an important influence on Weber as an
    accomplished printmaker and painter himself.  In the early 1920s, Weber
    traveled to Paris just in time to view a major Paul Cézanne retrospective,
    as well as visit Gertrude Stein’s artistic salon and take classes at
    Matisse’s private academy.  Weber worked in singular modern style throughout
    most of his career and influenced many following generations of American
    artists.  Rubenstein 109.

    scarce lithograph.<br><br>Wood (1891-1942), best known for his depictions of
    rural American life, was one of the original members of a Midwestern
    American art movement in the 1930s known as Regionalism.  He was dedicated
    to spreading his artistic tenets and founded an artist's colony near Cedar
    Rapids, Iowa, in 1932, before he became a fine art professor at the
    University of Iowa and the state director of the Public Arts Fund in 1934. 
    As Wood was so involved with teaching, and because his technique was
    meticulously time-consuming, he only produced approximately 50 paintings and
    19 lithographs over the course of his career. <br><br>His lithographs, which
    represent the bulk of his output at the end of his career, were made in
    limited editions of 250, published by Associated American Artists (AAA), New
    York, and advertised through a national catalogue for $5 apiece.  However,
    Sultry Night is a particularly significant, controversial lithograph because
    of its blatant, realistic depiction of the male nude (which is
    coincidentally the only nude represented by a Regionalist artist).  At the
    time, the male nude was so shocking that the New York postmaster refused to
    send what were deemed indecent lithographs--therefore, only 100 impressions
    of Sultry Night were produced and sold "over the counter" at AAA.  Cole 6.

    Lewis chronicled New York in their prints and made their reputation as
    printmakers.  They were associated with the American Scene and Landeck came
    to specialize in urban landscapes with only implicit presence of a human
    subject.  Like Hopper, Landeck drew from the drama unfolding outside his
    window, he created the composition of the 1938 etching and drypoint
    Manhattan Nocturne from his apartment window at University Place and 8th
    Street. <br><br> Landeck was born in Wisconsin and raised in Toledo, Ohio. 
    He studied architecture at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and at
    Columbia University, New York.  The same year he graduated in 1927, Landeck
    was noticed by Kennedy Galleries, New York for his etching and was soon
    represented by them.  When he could not find architectural work during the
    Great Depression, Landeck turned to printmaking full time, focusing on the
    themes of isolation and a deserted city.  In 1934, Landeck opened the
    short-lived School for Printmakers with George Miller and Martin Lewis and
    continued to teach at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.  He took up engraving
    after meeting Stanley William Hayter in 1941, a medium that he would
    continue to use, almost exclusively, until the end of his career.

    for Hopper's (1882-1967) oil painting Pennsylvania Coal Town, 1947, now in

    studies of the lone character in the oil painting, the standing man holding
    what appears to be a rake, as well as detail studies of the man's arm and
    rake handle and the urn planter.  According to the Butler Institute of
    American Art, "Pennsylvania Coal Town is a relatively late work [by Hopper]
    . . . You can hear the echoes of loneliness and isolation, a prevalent theme
    in many of his works (Automat, 1927; Nighthawks,1942; Hotel by a Railroad,
    1952, for example), in this depiction of a man raking leaves outside his
    home.  With a few deft strokes of the brush, Hopper’s man can be seen gazing
    off at something beyond our view—capturing a place and time which conveys
    stillness, solitude, and an eerie silence.

    extremely scarce lithograph.<br><br><br><br>Lozowick (1892-1973) was born in
    Ludvinovka, a small village near Kiev and moved to the larger city of Kiev
    with his brother as a child. He studied at the Kiev Art School before
    following his brother again to New York in 1906 where he settled in New
    Jersey, got a job at a factory, and learned English. He continued his
    studies, at the National Academy of Design, taking courses with Emil Carlsen
    and Leon Kroll. They pushed Lozowick to seek a personal viewpoint in his
    artwork beyond the traditional training. He took a break from making art
    while he was a student at Ohio State University and joined the army during
    World War I.<br><br>The modern European art movements had a profound effect
    on Lozowick, and between 1920 and 1924 he traveled to Europe and spent time
    meeting modern artists and enmeshing himself into artistic and cultural
    communities. He was particularly drawn to Cubist and Futurist styles, and in
    1923, when he was introduced to lithography, he applied their principles to
    American subject matter.<br><br>Lozowick was among a small group of artists,
    including Jan Matulka and Howard Cook, who depicted the industrial city.
    Embracing these European movements while choosing specifically American
    subject matter was typical of Precisionism, and while artists like Charles
    Sheeler and Ralston Crawford never organized, they shared the approach of
    paring down their compositions to the simplest of forms. After the fall of
    the stock market and as the country turned towards despair in the 1930s,
    Lozowick adapted his concept of the city. Along with many artists, he turned
    toward depicting the social reality of its residents who were affected by
    the Depression. Throughout his career, New York remained his primary subject
    matter, and he reflected in 1943, “From the innumerable choices which our
    complex and tradition-laden civilization presents to the artist, I have
    chosen one which seems to suit my training and temperament. I might
    characterize it this: ‘Industry harnessed by Man for the Benefit of
    Mankind.’”  Flint 185.

    Etchers, New York.  A superb, richly-inked impression.<br><br>Lewis
    (1881-1962) had met Edward Hopper approximately 15 years after his arrival
    in the United States in 1900.  The two artists shared discontent over their
    commercial careers.  In 1927, Lewis was given a solo exhibition at Kennedy &
    Company in New York and successive shows at the gallery were so well
    received that Lewis, like Hopper after his own first taste of success,
    stopped commercial work after 1929.  <br><br>Lewis's career was built upon
    his technical virtuosity in printmaking.  Lewis's first interest in
    printmaking has been tied to his work for the Sydney newspaper Bulletin in
    the 1890s.   While in Australia, he was exposed to works of several
    important etchers, including Australian artist Arthur Streeton, as well as
    Seymour Haden (Whistler's brother-in-law), Rembrandt, Charles Meryon, and
    James A. M. Whistler, but there was no known attempt to etch before Lewis
    reached the United States.  Lewis's first documented print, Smoke Pillar,
    Weehawken, printed in 1915, (see McCarron 1) has enough technical skill to
    argue that this was not the artist's first attempt (he was known to have
    destroyed unsatisfactory impressions).  The same year, Lewis encouraged
    Hopper to take up printmaking and gave him technical advice.  After this
    exchange, Hopper created his own etching Paris Street Scene with Carriage,
    1915-18 (see Levin 6).  While Lewis would employ aquatint and other
    processes in conjunction with etching, Hopper continued to work with only
    etching and drypoint.  Nevertheless, the two artists would use largely the
    same subject matter and compositional elements, like cutting angles and the
    interplay between light and shadow.  McCarron 131.

    and Industrial Art and at the Art Students League, New York.  From 1934 to
    1941 he worked almost exclusively in lithography.  During the 1930s he made
    numerous lithographs under the auspices of the New York Chapter of the
    W.P.A. (Works Progress Administration).  Around 1940 Pytlak began to
    experiment with the newly discovered graphic arts medium of the screenprint
    (or silkscreen).  He was among the first artists to be included in the
    silkscreen unit of the Graphic Arts Division of the New York Federal Arts
    Project.  At this time he also founded the National Serigraph Society. 
    Pytlak's screenprints of New York from the 1940s evoke the optimism and
    dynamic of the immediate post-war era as well as the gritty, sometimes
    lonely feel of the urban experience.

    American aesthetic and subjects.  He exhibited in the inaugural Washington
    Square Art Show in 1931, alongside Don Freeman and became employed by the
    Works Progress Administration until 1943.  Delaney had always expressed a
    natural curiosity in the daily lives of people in the city.  As in the
    present early work, he painted his observations of the quotidian without
    bias or political motive.  Delaney once said, "The curtain goes up on the

    going to the movies and was inspired to paint his own version of the past
    time in 1939, his oil on canvas New York Movie, in the collection of the

    a room full of people, as the usherette rests against the balustrade of the
    theater's interior while the audience, unnoticing, is entranced by the
    glowing projection.  Hopper used his sketches from the Strand, Palace,
    Republic and Globe theaters for the interior of the painting.

    aesthetic scenes, such as the subway stations, further encouraged by her

    tenant farmers who occupy them, for longer or shorter times, always have
    little children who play around the houses while the grownups work the

    Gallery, New York; Estate of Virginia M. Zabriskie.<br><br>Walkowitz
    (1878-1965) was born in Tyumen, Siberia to Jewish parents and immigrated to
    the Lower East Side of New York with his mother in 1889.  He was trained in
    the academic style at the National Academy of Design, New York, and also at
    the Académie Julian in Paris, though his style was most influenced by his
    experiences outside of the studio.  Walkowitz's studies in Paris intersected
    with Edward's Hopper's sojourns there at the same time, while Hopper was
    primarily studying the works of the Old Master artists.  During his time in
    Paris from 1906-07, Walkowitz saw Isadora Duncan (1877-1927) dance at
    Auguste Rodin's (1840-1917) Paris studio and made his first drawings of her.
    He later recalled, "She was a Muse.  She had no laws.  She didn't dance
    according to rules.  She created.  Her body was music.  It was a body
    electric, like Walt Whitman."  Like Duncan's dancing, Walkowitz's drawings
    and watercolors were created by quick and spontaneous lines and washes of
    color.  In Paris, Walkowitz was also impressed by the landmark 1907 Paul
    Cézanne (1839-1906) retrospective exhibit at the Salon d'Automne and by his
    introduction to the work of Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and Henri Rousseau
    (1844-1910).  By the time Walkowitz returned to New York, his style was
    heavily influenced by European Modernism, with emphasis on gestures,
    simplified forms and flat planes of bold color.  His first solo exhibition
    was held at Haas Gallery, the back of a modest frame shop, in New York in
    1908.<br><br>In 1912, Walkowitz met Albert Stieglitz (1864-1946) through
    Marsden Hartley (1877-1943) and became involved with 291, Stieglitz's New
    York gallery, which served as a hub of American modernism.  Stieglitz was so
    impressed by the young artist, that he sent him to study art in Greece,
    Italy and North Africa in 1914.  His style became more abstract; its reduced
    linear forms lent themselves to the city's rush skyward, prematurely
    anticipating the New York School and the Abstract Expressionists.<br><br>In
    1913, Walkowitz was represented at the Armory Show and in the 1916 Forum
    exhibition.  Walkowitz was concerned with politics and artists' rights and
    was active in various artist's groups, founding the People's Art Guild and
    the Society of Independent Artists (he became director of the latter from
    1918 to 1938).  In 1920, he exhibited at the Société Anonyme alongside
    Hartley and Joseph Stella (1877-1946).  Despite local and international
    recognition, Walkowitz was not nearly as well-known as his contemporaries. 
    Walkowitz painted into the 1940s, when his eyesight began to fail.

    its roots in European Cubism with its sharp edges and flattened forms, but
    American Precisionists focused primarily on depicting industrial subjects. 
    Crawford's work emphasized American symbols of industry such as skyscrapers,
    bridges, silos and machinery, creating dynamic, modern and innovative
    compositions out of flattened forms.  He also experimented with photography
    and graphic media such as screenprints.

    scarce print.<br><br>Pytlak (1910-1998), a native of Newark, New Jersey,
    attended the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Art as well as the Art
    Students League in New York.  He was a painter as well as a printmaker and
    executed murals while working for the W.P.A. in the 1930s.   In 1938, Pytlak
    joined the special screenprinting unit led by Anthony Velonis in the Federal
    Art Project's Graphic Arts department in New York, where he was among the
    first artists to use screenprinting as a fine art medium.  He was a founder
    of and became president of the National Serigraph Society and was awarded a
    Guggenheim Fellowship for printmaking in 1941 and would continue to promote
    the medium through exhibiting and teaching throughout his career. Between
    1941 and 1949, Pytlak is estimated to have created 96 screenprints, and
    during these years he had several solo exhibitions, including at the ACA
    Gallery, New York in 1942; the Weyhe Gallery, New York, in 1944; the
    Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., in 1948; and the Serigraph

    Drypoint, 1947.  216x290 mm; 8½x11½ inches, full margins.  Signed in pencil,
    lower right.  A superb, richly-inked impression of this scarce print.
    <br><br>Lewis (1881-1962) had considered the titles "Vanishing New York" and
    "Corner Fruit Stand" before ultimately deciding on the present title,
    Yorkville Night.  According to his records, the location is the corner of
    89th Street and Third Avenue near the artist's studio at 439 East 89th
    Street.<br><br>Lewis (1881-1962) had met Edward Hopper approximately 15
    years after his arrival in the United States in 1900.  The two artists
    shared discontent over their commercial careers.  In 1927, Lewis was given a
    solo exhibition at Kennedy & Company in New York and successive shows at the
    gallery were so well received that Lewis, like Hopper after his own first
    taste of success, stopped commercial work after 1929.  <br><br>Lewis's
    career was built upon his technical virtuosity in printmaking.  Lewis's
    first interest in printmaking has been tied to his work for the Sydney
    newspaper Bulletin in the 1890s.   While in Australia, he was exposed to
    works of several important etchers, including Australian artist Arthur
    Streeton, as well as Seymour Haden (Whistler's brother-in-law), Rembrandt,
    Charles Meryon, and James A. M. Whistler, but there was no known attempt to
    etch before Lewis reached the United States.  Lewis's first documented
    print, Smoke Pillar, Weehawken, printed in 1915, (see McCarron 1) has enough
    technical skill to argue that this was not the artist's first attempt (he
    was known to have destroyed unsatisfactory impressions).  The same year,
    Lewis encouraged Hopper to take up printmaking and gave him technical
    advice.  After this exchange, Hopper created his own etching Paris Street
    Scene with Carriage, 1915-18 (see Levin 6).  While Lewis would employ
    aquatint and other processes in conjunction with etching, Hopper continued
    to work with only etching and drypoint.  Nevertheless, the two artists would
    use largely the same subject matter and compositional elements, like cutting
    angles and the interplay between light and shadow.  McCarron 140.

    New York; private collection, New Jersey.<br><br>After attending the
    Canadian Royal Academy of Arts, Ontario and working as an artist in
    Montreal, Benjamin (1899-1985) moved to New York in 1923 and attended
    classes at the Art Students League, Cooper Union, and the Educational
    Alliance Art School while working as a commercial artist for the New York
    Sun newspaper, where he would work for the next 25 years.  Benjamin received
    instruction from Joseph Pennell, John Sloan and Yasuo Kuniyoshi and became
    close friends with Milton and Sally Avery.  As part of the artist circle
    surrounding Avery and the studios in the Lincoln Arcade, a building at 65th
    Street and Broadway later torn down to build Lincoln Center, Benjamin became
    acquainted with French modernists such as Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia
    as well as other New York artists including Stuart Davis and Mark Rothko. 
    Benjamin's formal training and his close association with French and
    American modernists created a stylistically blended œuvre that incorporated
    minute details with dynamic, sweeping lines and colors, which became more
    abstract as his career progressed.  During the Great Depression, Benjamin
    moved from Lincoln Arcade to East 59th Street, though still kept close ties
    with the Avery family, accompanying them to Gloucester, Massachusetts during
    the summers.  Rather than appeasing critics who called for a thoroughly
    American art genre to be consumed by the masses, Benjamin held to his idea
    that art should convey personal emotions and feelings rather than conforming
    to a strict dogma as in Social Realism, though he painted much of the same
    subjects.

    inches.  Signed in oil stick, lower recto.  <br><br>Provenance: Owings-Dewey
    Fine Art, Santa Fe, with the label on the frame back; private collection,
    New York.<br><br>Cook (1901-1980), most widely known for his lyrical prints
    of Manhattan, was born in Massachusetts and traveled the continental United
    States extensively.  As a young man, he moved to New York and enrolled in
    the Art Students League.  He studied printmaking there under Joseph Pennell
    (1857-1926) who, nearing the end of his life, was characterized by his
    atmospheric cityscape etchings.  Cook's interest in the medium increased
    after a trip to Paris in 1925, where he spent time with fellow ex-patriots
    and master printmakers James E. Allen (1894-1964) and Thomas Handforth
    (1897-1948).<br><br>Cook's career took off after a 1926 trip to Maine, when
    woodcuts he made there were picked up by Forum, one of the most
    widely-circulated American magazines at the time.  The publication
    subsequently commissioned Cook to create woodcuts of the American Southwest,
    where he became enamored with New Mexico and the Taos artist's colony,
    returning throughout his life (he relocated there permanently in 1939 and
    ultimately died in Santa Fe).  By the end of the 1920s, Cook's adept
    printmaking caught the interest of Carl Zigrosser (1891-1975), the esteemed
    director of the Weyhe Gallery in New York, who supported many emerging
    artists.  In 1929, Zigrosser both hosted Cook's first solo exhibition and
    encouraged him to travel to Paris, providing him entrée into the venerable
    lithography studio Atelier Desjobert.  Despite experimenting in a range of
    printmaking techniques, the woodcut technique remained Cook's medium of
    choice.<br><br>At the peak of his career, from the late 1920s until his 1939
    move to New Mexico, Cook feverishly depicted a rapidly-changing New York. 
    Construction on skyscrapers flourished in the interwar period, with landmark
    towers like the Chrysler Building completed in 1930 and the Empire State
    Building completed the following year, while the Great Depression halted
    progress on other projects and construction sites remained commonplace. 
    Cook was employed by the Works Progress Administration during this time.
    Artists like Cook, Louis Lozowick (1892-1973) and Samuel Margolies
    (1897-1974) embraced the evolving city as their subject, using exaggerated
    perspective to emphasize the grandeur of buildings, and portraying
    construction workers as everyday heroes.

    considered to be a proponent of the Ashcan School or "The Eight" and like
    some of the artists in this group, documented the vibrant theater and
    vaudeville communities.  While living in Philadelphia, Shinn performed in
    intimate amateur productions put on by friends such as Glackens, Henri, and
    Sloan.  Once in New York, Shinn continued this practice and created a small
    theater in his home, cofounding the "Waverly Street Players" with
    Glackens).  He befriended notable actors and theater patrons such as Elsie
    de Wolfe, Julia Marlowe, Clyde Fitch, David Belasco, and Stanford White,
    leading him to take on several commissions.  During the period between 1917
    and 1923, Shinn devoted himself full time to set designs and art direction
    for theater and movie productions.  In his painted New York scenes, Shinn
    emphasized the exchange between performer and spectator, which at times
    leaves a feeling of alienation.  In his so-called "glimpses of stage life,"
    Shinn painted from the back-lit perspective of behind the stage, casting his
    acrobats and performers in highlights and shadows.  The viewer is at once a
    voyeur as well as part of the spectacle.  In his later career when
    represented by Feragil Gallery, New York and by James Vigeveno in Los
    Angeles, Shinn revisited his love of entertainment and focused primarily on
    clown paintings, like the present work.

    into his work in 1934, the figures often overwhelmed by whirring scenes
    surrounding them.   During the 1940s, Marin's circus subjects were drawn
    from the point of view of a spectator looking down on the abstracted figures
    in the rings.  While Marin's 1930s circus scenes contained hapless clowns
    and acrobats, usually disrobed in some form, his later works on the theme
    feature just a suggestion of human presence in a looser, more spontaneous
    style.

    (1895-1976) was an American modernist painter who lived in New York and
    later Taos, New Mexico.  He began his career as an illustrative artist in
    New York, but ultimately shifted direction, studying successively at the
    National Academy of Design, Cooper Union, the Art Students League and the
    New York School of Fine and Applied Art.  Bisttram's early work is tied to
    Realism (in 1931 he went to Mexico on a Guggenheim grant, to study fresco
    techniques with Diego Rivera), but with successive trips to New Mexico
    beginning in 1930, and ultimately with his settling in Taos in 1932, his
    work became increasingly modern, colorful, spiritual and abstract.  In 1938,
    Bisttram founded, with Raymond Jonson, the Transcendental Painting Group, an
    organization devoted to nonobjective painting that aspired to enhance the
    spiritual level of society.  In his paintings of the late 1930s and beyond,
    Bisttram explored these concepts and gave titles, such as Upward, circa
    1940, and The Oversoul, that indicated the spiritual understandings he
    intended.  Throughout his career, Bisttram actively contributed to the
    artistic development of New Mexico.  He continued to draw inspiration from
    legends and visual motifs native to the Southwest but couched them in the
    nonobjective, transcendental terms he had evolved during the late 1930s.  In
    1952, he co-founded the Taos Art Association.

    #4 is one of a series of four related pictures that Stuart Davis made while
    working on The Mellow Pad, a painting in the Brooklyn Museum’s collection. 
    In all of these works, the word pad appears—here, sideways in green at the
    upper left (and a number 4 is in white at the lower right).  This title
    reveals the artist’s fondness for wordplay: pad refers both to an artist’s
    sketchbook and to the jazz slang term for “home.”  A lifelong aficionado of
    jazz, Davis regularly drew analogies between the visual patterns of his
    pictures and the syncopated rhythms of this modern form of American music."
