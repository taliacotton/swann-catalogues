  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Brothers William Hinde (1773-1834) and Samuel Hinde (1778-1840) of Liverpool
    were sons of notorious slave trader Thomas Hinde, and as this letter shows,
    continued to pursue those profits after their father's 1799 death until the
    bitter end. This letter is addressed to their agent in the Caribbean. They
    quote their own 14 July letter advising him that "you will be able to effect
    advantageous sales, either there or at Tobago, where slaves are much liked.
    The late measures adopted by the legislature here for limiting the numbers
    of ships employed in the trade to those already engaged in it, and the
    pledge entered into by both houses to abolish the trade next sessions, are
    circumstances which in our opinion must tend to advance the prices with
    you." Still waiting for a reply, they clarified their instructions a month
    later. They urged Lucas to bring home "the ship to this port with quick
    dispatch, in order that we may get her cleared if possible on another voyage
    prior to the Act of Abolition being passed. It is of great consequence in a
    new and burthensome vessell like the Trafalgar that she should have a full
    freight" or "she will not make one farthing, owing to the very heavy
    expences on new ships, and the high rate of insurance paid on African
    risques." <br><br><br><br>The Slave Trade Act would indeed be passed in
    March 1807, banning any British ship from leaving on a slaving voyage after
    1 May. This letter shows that the brothers Hinde were eager to squeeze every
    last drop of profit from this trade before it became illegal.

    First edition. This Andrew Jackson (most definitely not the president) was
    legally born free to an enslaved father and a free mother in Kentucky, but
    was nonetheless raised in slavery and did field work until his eventual
    escape as a young man. He made his way to Wisconsin and did some lecturing
    for the abolitionist cause. This memoir was "narrated by himself, written by
    a friend," and concludes with 3 abolitionist "Songs of Freedom" by other
    authors. The friend was likely John N.T. Tucker, an author, newspaperman and
    abolitionist activist who was a Syracuse resident at the time. The Preface

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Colonel John McNeil (circa 1780s-December 1843) owned cotton plantations in
    Autauga and Coosa Counties, Alabama. He was listed in the 1840 census for
    Nixburg, Coosa County as a man in his 50s with one younger white woman
    (apparently his orphaned niece) and 46 enslaved people. We can thus safely
    assume that the many patients named in this account were enslaved rather
    than family members. Dr. Joseph H. Vincent made 34 visits to the plantation
    between May and November 1843, before the Colonel's sudden death on 7
    December. These visits are listed in excruciating detail: "opening abcess
    for boy," "blister plaster for Jaque," "drawing tooth for negro," "fitting
    truss on Silas," and more. The "bill to treatment of gonorrhea" may have
    been for the colonel, though. The running account was written in a ledger
    book, but cut out and submitted to the estate for payment, which was settled
    on 30 January 1844, when it was docketed on the second page.

    from slavery and made his way to a Union camp at Baton Rouge, where he
    joined the army as a private. A camp photographer took a series of
    photographs which graphically demonstrated the brutality he had endured. The
    present photograph was the best known. It was engraved for the 4 July 1863
    issue of Harper's Weekly, where it ran over the caption "Gordon Under
    Medical Inspection." <br><br><br><br>This example seems to be copied from
    one printed by Chandler Seaver in Boston, as the original mount with

    George Washington, escaped, and was soon appointed mayor of British-held
    Manhattan. He fled to Canada in 1783 at the conclusion of the war.

  TYPESET: 108 manuscript documents in one box; various sizes and conditions.
  at-a-glance: 'Vp, bulk 1841-1865'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    John Whelan Luke (1815-1896) was a local politician, militia major, and
    church elder in the town of Berryville in Clarke County, at the northern tip
    of Virginia. He served in the Virginia legislature in 1852. Numerous letters
    and documents in his papers relate to enslaved people. A neighbor named E.C.
    Stephenson requests in 1841 "to look out for some servants for hire, two or
    three men & if you here of a good woman let us know before the hireing takes
    place." Several of these hire receipts and agreements are offered here. In
    1846, Luke received payment from H.L. Opie for "the price agreed upon for
    servants Emily & Mary." In 1847, Madison Galloway agreed to pay "for hire of
    servant Mary for the entire year," and in 1857 James Frazier agreed to pay
    for "twenty dollars for hire of girl Mary for the ensuing year." Both
    agreements spell out the clothing which the lessee must provide to Mary for
    the year. Luke's 1850 tax bill includes fees on "9 slaves." A running
    account with a local physician includes fees for medicine and vaccination
    for "Negro girl," "Man Thomas," "Negro man" and "Negro girl" from 1862 to
    1864; Luke did not settle the bill until 1867.<br><br><br><br> A long 1841
    inventory of the estate of Jacob Luke includes valuations for "servant Milly
    & child Lucy, Adaline, Horrace, Violate, and Nestor." The 1846 auction
    results from the estate of Peter Luke list new owners for "One negrow man
    Fortune," a boy named Rowley, a woman named Let and her child, and an
    unnamed "Negrow woman, two children." An account with a local shoemaker
    shows several shoes made for unnamed servants among the family members in
    1862 and 1863. A 7 February 1852 letter from a townsman while Luke served in
    the state legislature urges him: "If there is any chance for the removal of
    the free Negroes from the state, and a tax on dogs in Clarke County, do
    advocate it." A school essay by a young relative named James William Luke is
    titled "Civilization," and begins "The only people in the world that are
    civilization are Caucassians. There has been no other that has reached the
    hight of civilization." <br><br><br><br>Very few of the papers in this
    collection are dated after the war. One exception is an 1881 letter to the
    "Long Marsh District School Board" from George L. D. Harris of Berryville.
    He explains that "Having taught the colored school in Louisville for
    successive seasons under your administration, I herein apply for the same
    this ensuing year." Harris's teaching certificate and examination results
    are enclosed. Harris appears in the 1900 census as a Black school teacher in
    Clarke County. <br><br><br><br>Beyond the slavery-related content, the
    collection may have some philatelic interest, featuring early manuscript
    postmarks from Allensville, KY (5 dated 1844-48) and Castleman's Ferry, VA
    (3 dated 1852-53). Local politics are also a strong point, as well as a few
    documents from the Berryville and Charleston Turnpike Road.

    This stereoview depicts 1315 Duke Street in Alexandria, VA, which in 1828
    became Franklin & Armfield, one of the largest slave-trading firms in the
    United States. Many thousands of enslaved people passed through these doors
    en route from Virginia to New Orleans and the booming cotton fields of the
    deep south. In 1858, the business was taken over by "Price, Birch & Co.,
    Dealers in Slaves." James H. Birch, one of the partners, was a veteran
    Washington slave trader who had played a central role in the horrific
    kidnapping of Solomon Northrup (Twelve Years a Slave) but was never
    convicted. The business was evacuated shortly before Union troops took
    possession of Alexandria in 1861. Today the building is home to the Freedom

    Sancho escaped from a Mississippi plantation and was presumed to have made

    a reward of up to $100 for his return. Sancho is described as "a Negro man,
    thirty years of age, about 5 feet high, very black complexion . . . & a fast
    walker." Sancho was said to be a skilled barber and "was born and educated
    in his Master's house"; he was thought to be so loyal that he must have
    "been inveigled away by some artful villains for their own use." Winthrop
    Sargent (1753-1820), who wrote and submitted the notice, was a Massachusetts
    native and former Revolutionary War officer who had served as governor of
    Mississippi Territory and then settled down to operate a plantation in
    Natchez, MS. While runaway ads were common in newspapers of this era, few
    were illustrated. This particular ad, which ran for a few days in late
    September and early October of 1807, is one of the better-known ones. The
    National Portrait Gallery acquired one, giving Sancho a permanent home among
    the nation's most famous faces.

    was liberated by young local abolitionist Samuel Willard, who then passed

    meeting. The incident is recounted in some detail, and the attendees offer
    several resolutions: "The modus operandi of abating the evils of slavery is
    not the province of this meeting to point out. We only know that stealing
    them is not the most honest way. . . . Having reason to believe that there
    are regular bands of abolitionists, organized with depots and relays of
    horses to run negroes through our state to Canada, and that one of them is
    in this town, we will form an Anti-Negro Stealing Society, as we formerly
    formed an Anti-Horse-Stealing Society, and that we will, in this
    neighborhood, break up the one as we broke up the other."

    This dramatic report of a successful mass escape was written by Jasper Loman
    Hall (1845-1883), a 13-year-old boy reporting on his own uncle's near death
    as one of the would-be captors. <br><br><br><br>"I told you bout Uncle Nedy
    Armstrong going after his negroes that ran away. He caught up with them and
    caught them. When they caught them, he had to shoot them to save his life.
    He shot three times. The first ball cut the skin of one of the negroes'
    forhead. The second ball went through his ear. The third ball missed and the
    negro stabed him. I am not certain whether he has got them all or not.
    Whether the stab that Mr. Armstrong got was considered dangerous or not, we
    have not heard." Two days later, he continued: "We heard some more of Mr.
    Armstrong's case. Him and five others went and caught them . . . all unarmed
    except Mr. Armstrong, and was taking hold of them, and they refused and
    commenced fighting, and Mr. Armstrong shot three times (as I stated), and
    they had him down, and would have killed him, only he called (to his negro)
    and said 'Dave, are you going to let them kill me!' and then Dave took them
    off. They did not get one of the negroes, but they got the horses. This
    happened 9 miles below Morgantown. Mr. Armstrong was taken to Morgantown and
    got his wounds dressed (he was very badly cut and bruised up). I do not know
    whether he is considered beond reach of recovery or
    not."<br><br><br><br>This dramatic story was reported in several newspapers,
    The escape featured 10 enslaved people--men, women and children--from 4
    different masters in Pruntytown, WV. A 9-person search party caught up with
    them near Davistown, just over the state line in Pennsylvania, and met with
    armed resistance. Armstrong was nearly killed by an escapee named Harrison
    and stopped a death blow from a corn scythe with his bare hand; he was saved
    only by his own slave Dave, as described in the letter. The escapees were
    presumed to have reached Canada successfully. See the Spirit of Jefferson
    (Charles Town, WV), 16 November 1858. The letter has enough differences in
    the details to suggest that Hall had sources beyond the newspapers, as the
    central figure, Edward Jones Armstrong (1808-1877), seems to have been his
    uncle. Armstrong was married to Sophia Rightmire; Jasper's mother was
    Harriet Rightmire Hall. The dateline of "Helon" in Barbour County, VA (which
    soon became part of West Virginia) refers to a post office near Phillippi
    which is no longer in existence. Two Hall family members served as
    postmasters of Helen in the early 1850s. <br><br><br><br>Hall also described
    a series of religious revival meetings in his neighborhood, with
    participants including his own "Grandma Hall." He concludes the letter by
    outlining his plan to study law "and then I will be the President of the U.
    S. and then I will waken the black Abolitionists to there senses if they
    have any."

    In the debate over slavery, one of the country's most popular politicians,
    Henry Clay, was infamous for attempting to play both sides. This cartoon
    skewers one of his 1839 speeches as he angled for another presidential
    nomination: "I consider Slavery as a Curse, a curse to the Master and a
    grievous wrong to the Slave," insisting he was "no friend to slavery." The
    cartoon imagines these words existing above the Mason-Dixon Line for
    northern audiences only, while below the line he admits that he owns 60
    slaves and hopes to stall emancipation as long as possible. John Calhoun,
    the country's most prominent slavery advocate, shakes his hand and promises
    his support. Both men are carelessly stepping upon a prone enslaved man, who
    promises "Rejoice not against me O mine enemy when I fall; I shall arise."

    The great abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison began his publishing career in
    Baltimore in 1829, and quickly got into hot water by calling Francis Todd
    and Captain Nicholas Brown "highway robbers and murderers" for shipping 75
    slaves in chains from Baltimore to New Orleans. He was successfully sued for
    libel in Maryland court, refused to pay the fine, and spent seven weeks in
    prison. This helped launch Garrison to national prominence in abolitionist
    circles, and became a well-known episode in his biography. An unnamed party
    in Baltimore apparently got sick of hearing that his arrest was due to the
    slavery-loving people of Maryland, and produced this pamphlet many years
    after the trial. It sets out to demonstrate with long excerpts from the
    trial that the jurors were actually opposed to slavery, and that Garrison
    was convicted because he had actually libeled the two slavers. Sabin 26710.

    Uel Merrill Fisk (1823-1911) was a white Universalist pastor and lecturer on
    the radical abolitionist lecture circuit in the years leading up to the war.
    Though he was not a household name in his day, he was an active soldier in
    the good fight. The lectures seen here are remarkably direct and strident,
    and offered his audiences a clear vision of the institutional roots of
    slavery, inspiring in them a sense of immediacy for the complete defeat of
    slave power. He did most of his work in western New York, other than a short
    stint as pastor in Taunton, MA in the late 1850s. In 1872, he removed to
    rural Galena, MO, where he spent the remainder of his long
    life.<br><br><br><br>"Review of the Recent Strife between Freedom and
    Slavery, and the Indications of the Future," parts 1, 2 and 3. [51], [41],
    [57] pages in 3 volumes. A series of lectures which provides a detailed
    history of the anti-slavery movement from the 1830s through 1850s, and of
    the powerful institutional forces which suppressed it; also foresees the
    inevitable Civil War more than 4 years before Fort Sumter. First delivered

    said the rebellion of Jereboam against the tyranny of a base king was
    right." [35] pages, circa 1864. Includes a passage which gives a good sense
    of Fisk's rhetoric: "They revolted from the most liberal government ever
    established, a government in which they had more than their equal share,
    they revolted for the sole purpose of maintaining their political
    ascendancy, and retaining the power to hold a weaker race in bondage. . . .
    This is not a rebellion from oppression, but for the purpose of oppression;
    not to secure a right, but to retain the power to rob others of their
    rights." (pages 17-19). <br><br><br><br>Untitled lecture on the upcoming
    November 1868 election, beginning "The time is rapidly approaching when the
    Constitution of our country will call upon us to elect our rulers." [128]

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Charles J. Jack (1812-1873) was a Brooklyn liquor store owner, often
    referred to in the press as "Colonel C.J. Jack." He had been an active
    nativist in Philadelphia in the 1840s, and then became involved in New York
    politics. This is the original manuscript of an anti-slavery speech he gave
    shortly before the Civil War. While stating emphatically that he is no

    These letters were written by James Arnold Whipple (1808-1864), a mechanic
    who served as an officer of the Worcester Anti-Slavery Society. These two
    letters show a radical abolitionist who was eager to confront and defeat
    slaveowners--with his fists if necessary. <br><br><br><br> Whipple's first
    letter describes his visit to Washington on 24 December 1861 after his
    return to Hopedale, MA: "Tuesday eve attended president's levee. Saw many of
    the notables of Washington and pronounce Washington a great humbug, the
    dirtiest city I was ever in, and some of the meanest folks in the world live
    there. We all shook hands with old Abe. He looks honest, but does not seem
    to me to be verry smart. I see many men thare that are much smarter." He
    then got a pass from Vice President Hamlin to tour the front lines in
    Virginia, seeing "about one hundred and fifty thousand troops in all, going
    down as far as Falls Church and to Alexandria. Stood on the spot whare
    Ellsworth was shot. Could see with a glass the rebel pickets near Falls
    Church." On his trip, "had many discussions with slaveholders in Maryland
    and Washington. Come near fighting, but found they would back down at last.
    Found them armed generally. I carried no arms, but was readey for them any
    time, could handle any of them that I see. I told one man I could choke him
    to death in two minutes. He sneaked off with a pistol in his pocket. . . .
    We found the Negroes the best part of society, giveing the most intelligent
    answers and doing most all of the business." In closing he described the
    border region as "that God-forsaken country whare one man says he owns
    another." <br><br><br><br>His second letter, dated 27 March 1862 in
    Worcester, MA, reports on positive news: "I consider it some progress to
    have Dr. Cheever of New York, Gerritt Smith, Horace Greely and last though
    not least Wendell Phillips of Boston lecture in Washington and be heard by
    the president." He notes that Phillips was "mobbed in Cincinnati" across the
    river from Kentucky: "the poison virus of slavery is thare . . . it always
    wants to chrush out free speech, but the world moves and whether this war
    abolishes slavery or not immediately, it never can hold any power again."

    Lewis Garrard Clarke (1815-1897) was born into Kentucky slavery. To avoid
    being sold into a yet worse fate in Louisiana, he fled for Canada and
    freedom in 1841. He published "Narrative of the Sufferings of Lewis Clarke"
    and went out on the abolitionist speaking circuit, where he met aspiring
    author Harriet Beecher Stowe. The "Uncle Tom's Cabin" character George
    Harris is generally believed to be based on Clarke. He remained a popular
    speaker long after the war. A biography of Clarke appeared in 2014, "When
    Owing a Shilling Costs a Dollar: The Saga of Lewis G. Clarke, Born a White
    Slave" by Carver Clark Gayton. <br><br><br><br>We have traced no other
    examples of this Clarke portrait, though it was apparently done at the same
    sitting as two other well-known portraits. The caption on verso reads "Lewis
    G. Clark, the Original George Harris of Uncle Tom's Cabin, was born in
    Madison County, Kentucky, March 15, 1815, on his grandfather's plantation,
    on Silver Creek, is brother to J.M. Clark, of Cambridgeport, the Messenger
    in the U.S. Sub-Treasury." We trace no other Clarke portraits at auction.

    This proclamation was issued by the radical faction of the Cuban nationalist
    rebels against Spanish rule in first months of the Ten Years' War. It is
    illustrated with a dramatic woodcut signed "LFR" depicting a freed man and a
    rebel celebrating in front of the Cuban flag. The proclamation declared
    freedom for all the enslaved people of Cuba, in hopes that they would join
    the revolutionary struggle. It provided for eventual compensation to
    slaveholders, and ordered that freed individuals must serve the revolution
    either through military service or by continuing with their previous work.
    Among the signers were the important leaders Salvador Cisneros y Betancourt
    (as president, just below the printed text) and Ignacio Agramonte y Loynáz
    (as secretary, to the left of the engraving). The practical effect of this
    decree was modest, as the rebels only controlled limited territory before
    their ultimate defeat, and their territory was generally under control of
    more conservative military commanders. Slavery did not actually end in Cuba
    until 1886.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Jacob Lawrence (1917-2000) first came to national prominence as an artist in
    1941 with his 60-panel Great Migration series. He was drafted into the Coast
    Guard in 1943 and served in public affairs aboard the ship Sea Cloud, the
    first integrated warship in the United States since the Civil War. Lawrence
    produced approximately 48 paintings for the Coast Guard during this period,
    capturing the spirit of men at sea. In October 1944, the Coast Guard
    collaborated with the Museum of Modern Art in New York on a Jacob Lawrence
    exhibition, which featured the entire Great Migration series and 8 of his
    new Coast Guard paintings. Almost the entire body of his Coast Guard output
    is now lost. <br><br><br><br>Offered here are 14 promotional photographs of
    these Coast Guard paintings. Most notable are photographs of 5 paintings
    which did not appear in "Jacob Lawrence: Paintings, Drawings, and Murals, a
    Catalog Raisonné" by Nesbett and Dubois in 2000--in other words, their
    existence was not otherwise known to Lawrence scholarship. These are titled
    "Checker Game," "Handling Line," "Machinist Mate," "Worship," and
    "Wrestlers." Of these 5, one ("Handling Line") was later reproduced in John
    Ott's article "Battle Station MoMA: Jacob Lawrence and the Desegregation of
    the Armed Forces and the Art World" in American Art 29:3 (Fall 2015). These
    five paintings do not appear to have been included in the MoMA exhibition.
    Each had a typed caption from the Coast Guard's Public Information Division
    laid down on verso, with a few sentences of description interpreting the
    painting and extolling Lawrence's importance. For example, the caption for
    "Machinist Mate" (illustrated) reads "A Coast Guard machinist's mate solders
    wire in the engine room of a Coast Guard-manned troop transport in this
    impressionistic watercolor by Coast Guard Combat Artist Jacob A. Lawrence of
    Brooklyn, N.Y. The brilliant young Negro artist has caught the cramped
    working conditions and the feeling of machinery in this bold depiction of
    life aboard ship." "Handling Line" similarly shows Coast Guardsmen examining
    their lines for signs of wear. "Worship" depicts a "service in the Jewish
    faith aboard a Coast Guard-manned troop transport. His pulpit is marked with
    the Star of David." "Checkers" and "Wrestlers" depict recreational
    activities to break the shipboard tedium; one of the checker players sports
    a prominent tattoo and has his cigarette precariously balanced on a stack of
    game pieces. <br><br><br><br>Even more than with most artists, a Jacob
    Lawrence reproduction without color is hardly a substitute for the
    original--but for some of these paintings, it may be all we have.
    <br><br><br><br>7 of the photographs ("General Quarters," "Holy Stoning the
    Deck," "Officer's Steward," "Prayer," two different paintings titled
    "Recreation," and "Signal Practice") have shorter title labels from the
    Coast Guard, short exhibit labels from the Museum of Modern Art, and stamps
    indicating that the photographs were shot by MOMA staff photographer Soichi
    Sunami, presumably to publicize the October 1944 exhibition. These are 7 of
    the 8 Coast Guard paintings which were displayed at MoMA, although in these
    cases at least reproduction images survive elsewhere. Similarly, photographs
    of "Anchor on Cart" and "Bakers" show paintings which have been reproduced
    elsewhere, even if the originals is unknown.

  CROSSHEAD: File of his correspondence with the printers of his John Brown series.
  TYPESET: >-
    13 items in one folder, including 5 letters signed by Jacob Lawrence;
    minimal wear.
  at-a-glance: 'Vp, 1974-78'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    One of the highlights of Jacob Lawrence's artistic output was his series of
    22 paintings on abolitionist John Brown, completed in 1942. In 1974, the
    Detroit Institute of Arts issued them as a portfolio of silk-screen prints.
    This correspondence file was retained by the printers, Ives-Sillman Inc. of
    New Haven, CT, and documents their collaboration with Lawrence on this
    portfolio and other projects. <br><br><br><br>Included are 4 typed letters
    signed by Lawrence, one unsigned carbon copy, and another letter entirely in
    his hand. His first, dated 18 August 1975, announces that he has sent the
    silk screen design for his "Harlem Street Scene" for the Harlem School of
    the Arts, and on 23 September he requests the painting's return. His 1
    January 1976 letter discusses the printing of the John Brown series: "I
    appreciate the need for my full cooperation during its execution. I do look
    forward to making a contribution at any stage that it is felt I might be
    needed." On 19 September 1976 he writes to the Detroit Institute of the Arts
    that he has now received the first half of the portfolio in its entirety and
    that "the Ives-Sillman Studio is doing an excellent job . . . with great
    sensitivity" (sending this carbon copy of the compliment to the firm). On 24
    November he announces his travel plans to fly in on 20 December for the
    final step: "Could you please let me know if the graphics will be available
    for signing at the time of our arrival." Lawrence's final letter is more
    personal, written shortly after the death of the firm's partner Norman Ives
    on 2 February 1978. He writes to the surviving partner Sewell Sillman: "It
    was both a pleasure and a rewarding experience to have known him, to have
    seen and heard him talk about his work. And of course to have had such a
    professional as Norman show the interest and sensitivity that he did in my
    work was, for me, an honor. . . . I wish to thank the Ives-Sillman Studio
    for its sensitive and creative work in silk-screening the John Brown
    series." <br><br><br><br>Also included are 7 other items relating to the
    firm's work with Lawrence. A preliminary letter from the Detroit Institute
    of Arts is dated 24 Jne 1974: "We are still deeply interested in this
    project but, as you must realize, the financing of it needs considerable
    discussion." 4 of Sillman's retailed carbon copy letters to Lawrence
    document his work. On the Harlem School of the Arts project, he notes on 14
    November 1975: "The edition is 150. With the original, I am enclosing 160
    prints. The extras are for errors made in signing, keep the rest for
    yourself." On 15 December 1975 he announces the approval for "a Portfolio in
    a limited edition of your series of 22 gouache on John Brown. . . . Since
    the original work can not be removed from the museum . . . I started the
    project while I was at the University of Michigan by examining five of the
    works. I made an outline drawing of each work and, using a printers edition
    of the Pantone Matching System, I selected colors. . . . I will develop a
    screenprint as close as I can to the original." On 17 February 1976 he
    announces that a color transparency for #7 has been sent "because it will be
    about as difficult as any in the publication. . . . I will want to ask you
    about details like the brush marks in the table and in the walls." On 27
    March 1976, he tries to clear up some confusion on print numbering:
    "Transworld has, in addition to the 125 numbered and signed prints, 40 which
    are signed but not numbered. Hopefully, you have 10 more which you should
    title and sign but not number." Finally, the lot includes a shipping notice
    of a complete mock-up sent to the Detroit Institute of Arts on 9 December
    1976, and an unsigned contract for the project between the firm and the
    Institute. As a whole, this file is an important historical source on one of
    Jacob Lawrence's most enduring projects.

    1989), a few with "M.A.W." inked stamps on verso, few of them signed or

    Masood Ali Wilbert Warren (1907-1995) of New York attended the Art Students
    League in the 1930s, graduated from New York University in 1939, served in
    the United States Army for many years as a quartermaster sergeant, and
    received a Masters in the Arts from Temple University in 1961. His work was
    exhibited at the National Academy of Design, the American Watercolor
    Society, and the National Arts Club. <br><br><br><br>Warren is known
    primarily for his portrait busts and other sculptural work, but as seen in
    this archive, he was also a prolific sketcher. The bulk of the pieces in
    this lot are candid portrait sketches of unidentified people, usually alone
    or sometimes in pairs, many of them Black but spanning a wide range of
    ethnicities. His subjects are often depicted on park benches, strolling down
    sidewalks, or sitting at lunch counters, evoking the streets of New York in
    the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. A few are arranged by subject matter, with
    folders devoted to musicians, nudes, and animals. Most of the pieces are
    about 12 x 9 inches; a portfolio box contains 17 larger sketches of nudes,
    about 18 x 12 inches, as well as a 17 x 14 watercolor portrait dated 1979.
    <br><br><br><br>In addition to the original sketches, this lot includes more
    than 50 personal and professional letters to Warren, 1940-77, including
    letters from Congressman Charles Rangel, Manhattan Borough President Percy
    Sutton, numerous letters regarding employment and commissions, and some
    relating to his Muslim faith. More than 70 photographs are included, many of
    them official Air Force photographs documenting his sculptural work, or of
    the artist in uniform and/or at work. Also included are portraits inscribed
    to Warren by singers Lena Horne and Kay Starr in 1948. Two large panels with
    mounted photographs are proposals for large sculpture projects--a monument
    to World War Two ace pilot Thomas McGuire which was given a prominent place
    at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, and another to the lost submarine
    SSN Thresher. <br><br><br><br>Selections from this archive were on exhibit
    at the New York Public Library's George Bruce Library in February 2018 as
    "Masood A.W. Warren: Harlem's Everyday People." Provenance: gift from the
    artist to the consignor.

    Charles White expressed his support for the imprisoned activist Angela Davis
    in several ways, most prominently by authorizing the reproduction of his
    recent lithograph "Love Letter 1" in this appeal by the National United
    Committee to Free Angela Davis and All Political Prisoners. The card was
    intended to be filled out as a sort of petition to California's governor
    Ronald Reagan. It reads in part "Dear Governor Reagan . . . Because we truly
    believe that she is being denied the presumption of innocence and equal
    protection under the law . . . we ask you, as Governor, to intercede for the
    release of Angela Davis on reasonable bail." Ironically, the card's beauty
    probably undercut its effectiveness, as this and other copies were saved
    rather than mailed in. Beegan & Gustafson, Angela Davis pages 54, 56.

    The Black scientist and surveyor Benjamin Banneker (1731-1806) is best known
    today for the annual almanacs he published from 1791 through 1796. This is
    his scarce second almanac, which was published simultaneously in
    Philadelphia and Baltimore. It begins with a page-length biography of
    Banneker (it also appeared in his 1792 almanac), describing his background
    and education: "To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable
    to improvement: what he has learned, however, he did not forget; for as some
    hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of
    these." He also describes the astronomical calculations he presents in the
    almanac, which were "finished without the least information or assistance
    from any person . . . so that whatever merit is attached to his present
    performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own." <br><br><br><br>Typical
    of almanacs of this period, it also contains detailed monthly calculations
    on sunrise, sunset, and phases of the moon, as well as predictions on the
    weather. An engraving of "The Anatomy of Man's Body, as said to be governed
    by the Twelve Constellations" appears on page 3. Other features include a
    list of feast days, a description of the coming eclipses, a table of
    compound interest, a lengthy court calendar, and longer text pieces such as
    Benjamin Rush's "A Plan of a Peace-Office, for the United States." Several
    relate to the anti-slavery movement, including "Abstract from the Speech of
    William Pitt on the Motion for the Abolition of the Slave Trade" and
    "Extract from Wilkinson's Appeal to England on Behalf of the Abused
    Africans." <br><br><br><br>Banneker had famously corresponded with Thomas
    Jefferson about his almanac in 1791. In this issue, he includes a long
    abstract from Jefferson's "Notes on Virginia" in opposition to slavery, in
    which Jefferson hopes for "total emancipation . . . with the consent of the
    masters, rather than by their extirpation." Drake, Almanacs 10324; Evans

    endorsements including singers Rosa Henderson and Ethel Waters.
    <br><br><br><br>This company was inspired by the success of Madame Walker's
    beauty supply empire. Circa 1921, Hessig-Ellis, a white-owned Memphis
    company, set up a separate division with 35 Black employees called Madame
    Mamie Hightower's Golden Brown Beauty Preparations. Mamie Hightower
    (1867-1927) was an actual person--wife of a porter at Hessig-Ellis--but
    apparently served only as a figurehead (see Martha Patterson, "The American

    to promote a more natural and Afrocentric standard of beauty. The singer
    Abbey Lincoln was an organizer and appears here as the first model. This
    program begins with an essay by president Cecil Brathwaite [Elombe Brath],
    "The Winds of Change--In Coiffure & Fashion," followed by photographs of 10
    female models and 4 males, as well as cartoons, a tribute to Marcus Garvey,
    and photographs of the African Jazz-Art Society & Studio directors.
    Secretary-treasurer Ronnie [Kwame] Brathwaite was also responsible for the

    member of SNCC, Julius Lester collected these African-American folk songs
    and tales, which later became part of his 1969 book "Black Folk Tales." The
    title page has a black panther reading a red colored book to 3 young
    children. Lester has stated that this was published in-house at SNCC and he
    believes that less than 1,000 copies were printed. The illustrator Jennifer
    Lawson, a Black artist, later became senior vice-president at the

    A quiet sunny day on the University of California campus in Berkeley. A
    young man sits at a folding card table with tidy stacks of freshly printed
    Black Panther publications behind a sign reading "Support the Black Panther
    Party!" He is reading the 18 September issue of the early underground
    newspaper, the Berkeley Barb. The caption on verso presents the scene as a
    campus radical freak show, giving equal billing to the "coed wearing
    dungarees and a turtleneck sweater." These are not the Black Panthers we
    know from other images. <br><br><br><br>Stokely Carmichael had been working
    with the Lowndes County Freedom Organization in Alabama, which had developed
    the iconic Black Panther logo to help with their voter registration drive.
    This young man was likely raising funds to support the Alabama project. The
    Black Panther name and logo were becoming popular in rallies on college
    campuses and other radical hotbeds, and a New York group had already adopted
    the name. However, not until late October 1966--a month after this
    photograph was taken--did Huey Newton and Bobby Seale launch a new
    organization in nearby Oakland, which they called the Black Panther Party
    for Self-Defense.

    This is the original layout for an article published in Princeton's
    short-lived radical student magazine, Prism. The article was written by a
    Princeton undergraduate and Black Panther member who signed only as
    "Khalid," and offers a detailed centerfold exploration of the New Jersey
    Black Panthers, complete with a list of officers. The language is
    incendiary: "It's going to come down to war in the streets. We're talking
    about changing the whole structure of Western society. . . . The white man
    is only brave when he knows he's got the gun and he knows you haven't.
    Otherwise, he's a scared motherfucker. There's a message in that for Black
    people everywhere. Even on the Princeton campus." <br><br><br><br>The
    article also includes a vivid description of Newark street life: "It does a
    Princeton Black good to hit Newark, to come out of Penn Station and walk
    down to Broad and Market (the Wallace stickers on that Market St.
    construction site notwithstanding). The minute you hit Market and Broad you
    know you're in a city with a heavy, poor, and superior (i.e.) Black
    population. A Black can't help but dig the contrasts at that center-city
    intersection: red neck laborers, liberal/conservative businessmen, poor
    white trash of all sorts, and Black people--Black people waiting on tables,
    waiting for the bus home into the slum." This layout is illustrated with a
    dramatic 9-inch panther head, composed of a black-paper collage with inked
    detail. <br><br><br><br>With--a layout for another article in the same
    magazine, a back-page article titled "Bringing Back Black" by Bob Blockum,
    15½ x 11 inches. It describes the effort to launch the Black Cultural Center
    of Trenton. The article is printed in white on black background, and is laid
    out in a decorative border of African-inspired art. The article is continued
    on another page (layout not present) <br><br><br><br>and--the published
    issue of Prism featuring these articles, printed in red and black. 24 pages,
    17 x 11½ inches, on 6 folding sheets of newsprint; minimal wear. It also

    was held at Bobby Hutton Memorial Park, officially known as DeFremery Park,
    in Oakland. Stokely Carmichael appeared, the week after officially parting
    ways with SNCC, as did David Hilliard, Kathleen Cleaver, and Bobby Seale.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This poster advertised the first of many Free Huey rallies. It attracted a
    crowd of 5000 to Oakland Auditorium to hear Stokely Carmichael, Bobby Seale,
    Betty Shabazz, Eldridge Cleaver and H. Rap Brown (the latter two not named
    here). The famous portrait of Newton in the fan-backed chair is featured at
    center. The Oakland Tribune story on the rally the next day noted that "a
    wicker chair in which Newton was once photographed for a widely distributed
    poster was placed empty in the center of the stage." No other examples of
    this poster have been traced in OCLC or at auction. <br><br><br><br>The
    poster was designed by Lisa Lyons, whose work with the Panthers also
    included designing their famous logo. This copy came from her personal
    files, via a Thomaston Place auction, 14 February 2016, to the consignor.

    First edition. Includes several of Newton's "greatest hits," including "Huey

    The Movement"; "Functional Definition of Politics"; "The Genius of Huey P.
    Newton"; and the October 1966 Black Panther party Platform. Eldridge Cleaver
    writes in a 2 January 1970 introduction: "One can picture Huey as he was
    when he wrote them: hard pressed by pigs who he knew were plotting to kill
    him. With pigs breathing down his neck, Huey was racing against time that
    had almost run out to get the information down on paper. . . . Let no one
    think that the Black Panther Party has relinquished its demand that Huey be
    set free." Illustrated with photographs of Newton and a portrait by Emory
    Douglas.

    On 13 January 1970, three Black inmates at Soledad Prison were shot by a
    prison guard for engaging in a fistfight. The ensuing investigation
    exonerated the guard; within an hour, another white prison guard was killed
    in retaliation. Prisoners George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo and John Clutchette
    were charged with the murder. Their defense quickly became a popular cause
    in activist circles; this poster featured a quote from Ho Chi Minh's prison
    diary. Jackson was killed in a breakout attempt on 21 August 1971, shortly
    before his trial; he left his modest estate to the Black Panther Party.
    Drumgo and Clutchette were acquitted the following year.

  at-a-glance: 'Frankfurt, Germany, [January] to December 1971'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This newspaper was an unusual collaboration between radical German student
    groups and Black GI's stationed in Germany, in an attempt to forge
    revolutionary solidarity across racial and national lines. The content draws
    heavily from Black Panther news gleaned from back in the States, but also
    has extensive information about the unique problems faced by the soldiers,
    including disciplinary hearings or abuse of soldiers who spoke out against
    racism. A 10-point manifesto printed in several issues mainly relates to the
    soldiers' grievances, including a call for abolishing the Uniformed Court of
    Military Justice, freedom for war resistors, and an end to the military
    caste system. The newspaper was not popular among the officer ranks, and
    each issue bore a disclaimer along the lines of "This paper is legal, but
    the pigs will probably bust anyone caught reading it." The first three
    issues have a printed slip tipped to the front page, dated 14 May 1971 and
    protesting the recent arrest of co-editor Larry Barnes.

    These two related New York newspapers were launched by Eldridge and Kathleen

    subcaptioned "Black Community News Service, Black Panther Party," and is
    designed to look much like the California-based weekly. It positions itself
    as the true heir to the Black Panther tradition, with two long editorials
    denouncing the David Hilliard-Emory Douglas faction. Issue #4 keeps the
    Panther logo but drops the Black Panther name and is now issued by the
    Cleavers' new Revolutionary Peoples Communications Network. Apparently the
    final issue of Right On! was dated 1 November 1971. That same day, the

    The Black Liberation Army was an underground revolutionary organization with
    close ties and overlapping membership with the Black Panthers, active from
    at least 1970 to 1981. As described in these police bulletins, "subjects are
    followers of Eldridge Cleaver and are . . . dedicated to killing police
    officers, attacking police stations, and the armed robberies of lending
    institutions." 64 members are listed, of whom 15 had active arrest warrants
    and 6 were already in custody. Photographs of each (mostly mug shots) follow
    the lists. Joanne Chesimard (Assata Shakur) is listed as "wanted" in the
    second bulletin; she remains of the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list. Little
    information regarding the Black Liberation Army has survived. Not only do we

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This poster features a series of first-person commandments for "the Black
    Woman, Mother of Civilization." Overtly anti-feminist, it states that
    "through me the Black man produces his nation . . . I care and make our home
    comfortable for my Husband . . . The best that I can give my nation is
    strong, healthy, intelligent children who will grow to be the leaders of
    tomorrow." It was advertised in the 14 February 1969 issue of the Nation of
    Islam newspaper, Muhammad Speaks, as "the hottest poster in New York!!"
    Shulamith Firestone, in her 1970 feminist classic Dialectic of Sex,
    criticizes this "much-circulated poster," and the text has been republished
    in many formats since. In 1970, the design was incorporated into the cover
    of the Nina Simone album Black Gold. However, we can trace no examples of
    this oft-discussed poster at auction, in OCLC, or elsewhere on the Internet.

    Forsyth Street in Atlanta, came to an end later in 1972. The Atlanta

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    An entertaining little cartoon book with unexpected heft. Alice Crolley
    Browning (1907-1985) was an author, editor, founder of the International
    Black Writers Conference, and longtime Chicago elementary school teacher.
    This small pamphlet is unsigned, but also appears in her papers at the
    Chicago Public Library. Described as "Tiny Giants Series #2," it was a
    sequel to the author's even scarcer "It's No Fun to Be Black" from 1972. The
    language is hipper and more militant than one might expect from a retired
    teacher. Vignettes include "It's fun to go to the Loop and see Black
    Panthers slinking all over . . . selling Black Panther News" and "It's fun
    to see all the Black mayors and realize that there will be a Black president
    of the U.S.A., one of these days." She also name-checks poet Sam Greenlee,
    James Brown, Dick Gregory, and Jesse Jackson. The lively illustrations are

    Autograph Document Signed, one sheet, 6½ x 7¾ inches, with signature and

  at-a-glance: '[Dartmouth, MA], 20 August 1800'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The sea captain, shipbuilder and abolitionist Paul Cuffe (1759-1817) was one
    of the first successful Black businessmen in America. The son of a formerly
    enslaved father and a Wampanoag Indian mother, he developed his own
    shipyard, captained whaling ships, and made two trips to help the British
    colony from freed slaves at Sierra Leone. This invoice was written and
    signed by Paul Cuffe in 1799 and 1800, then in his early forties and already
    one of the leading merchants in what is now Westport, MA. It records a
    series of small transactions with a near neighbor, John Davis. Starting in
    September 1799, Cuffe billed Davis for carting several scow-loads of wood
    and ashes across the river, plus 2 gallons of tar, for a total of $5.00.
    Davis repaid him in part with 95 feet of clapboards. Cuffe then added
    additional charges for the repair of Davis's boat Abigail, for allowing
    Davis to use his cider mill, and for the wharfage of wood. The account was
    settled in full circa August 1800, presumably with the payment of $6.32 in
    cash to Cuffe. The receipt would have been given to Davis as proof of
    payment and filed among his papers. In the grand scheme of Cuffe's business
    activities, these were not major transactions, but they provide an
    interesting insight into his daily activities and community relationships
    during a period before his activism brought him a level of fame to match his
    fortune.

    Two evocative images of early 20th-century barber shops staffed by Black

    standing at their chairs, and an assistant (bearing a whisk broom). In the
    background can be seen a sign for Rapides Bank and the store of Jonas
    Rosenthal, placing the scene in Alexandria, LA. The later image shows 3
    barbers at their chairs, with one of the chairs holding a young White boy as
    a customer. The window sign reads "George's Barber Shop." The barber in the
    foreground of this photograph is almost certainly the same man at the rear
    chair in the earlier image. <br><br><br><br>George's Barber Shop at 1210 2nd
    Street was in operation from at least 1922 to 1941. It was managed by George
    W. Moore (circa 1883-1942), a Black man who operated a "white shop"
    according to the Alexandria Town Talk of 10 August 1933. City directories
    show that prior to launching George's, Moore was a barber at the Rapides
    Hotel from at least 1912 to 1914; perhaps the earlier image was taken at the
    hotel.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This project was the brainchild of star football player Art Powell, whose
    career had been curtailed by injuries. The project was initially launched in
    early 1969 in San Francisco, where retailers in the Black community were
    issued stamps featuring the image of singer James Brown, which they could
    give to their customers with each purchase. The loyal customers were then
    able to redeem a full album of 1200 stamps for a $3.00 discount. The blank
    pages are filled with promotional slogans for the project. See "Retailing:
    Soul Stamps" in Time Magazine, 11 July 1969. By 1971, the stamps were being
    distributed in 10 cities, and the albums were being printed in Chicago (as
    with the present example).

  at-a-glance: 'Omaha, NE: Educational Publishing Company, circa 1919'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The broad outlines of the Omaha race riot of 1919 follow a well-rehearsed
    script: a Black man named Will Brown is accused of raping a white woman; a
    mob of 10,000 gathers around the police station where he is jailed; he is
    eventually dragged out of his cell and burned. More uniquely to Omaha, the
    city's newly elected white progressive mayor and its police force made
    strenuous efforts to save Brown, barricaded in the fourth floor, though they
    eventually gave him up. Mayor Smith ventured out among the mob and said "If
    you must hang somebody, then let it be me." They obliged, and the mayor was
    hung from a lamp post--he was cut down by police when just short of death.
    Two members of the mob were killed, and large portions of the city looted or
    burned. 120 rioters were indicted, though not one served any prison time.
    This well-illustrated anti-mob pamphlet takes the perspective that
    "publicity is the surest cause for lawlessness" and properly describes Will
    Brown as the victim.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The author and activist James Weldon Johnson (1871-1938), best known as the
    lyricist of "Lift Every Voice and Sing," wrote 7 of these letters--most in
    his official capacity as Executive Secretary of the NAACP between 1921 and
    1929. He also sent a 1933 letter signed as "Jim" on the letterhead of Fisk
    University, regretting that he would be unable to attend the next board
    meeting, and hoping that Joel Spingarn may be convinced to remain as
    president. <br><br><br><br>33 of the letters (including 3 postcards and one
    incomplete unsigned letter) are from Walter F. White (1893-1955) as
    assistant secretary from 1923 to 1930, and then as Johnson's successor as
    Executive Secretary through 1944. Some of these relate to specific civil
    rights cases: investigating discrimination at a Philadelphia junior high
    school pool on 11 October 1923, or celebrating progress on "Jim Crow coaches
    on the Havana Special out of Pennsylvania Station" on 24 June 1931. Other
    letters discuss possible conference speakers such as Jane Addams, W.E.B. Du
    Bois, and Clarence Darrow. His 29 April 1932 letter looks back on history
    regarding a memorial to John Brown at Harper's Ferry: "We might as well
    close up shop if we do not challenge soon and vigorously this more or less
    united and organized campaign to discredit the Abolitionists, the Negro and
    everything the N.A.A.C.P. stands for." <br><br><br><br>Among the other

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Robert Richard Gros (1915-1997) was a publicist for Pacific Gas and Electric
    who doubled as a popular lecturer on current events, interviewing important
    world figures and then sharing his impressions with the public. In February
    1943, he interviewed NAACP Executive Secretary Walter F. White (1893-1955)
    about the "growing race problem in America." In April, he followed up with a
    long letter to White, proposing that "the American Negro himself must bear a
    large share of the blame." In particular, he faulted the "Negro press" for
    "trying to find some race discrimination . . . in even the most innocuous
    incident." <br><br><br><br>White, then at the peak of an impressive career
    as an activist, responded with remarkable thoroughness and patience. Over
    the course of several letters, he provided dozens of examples of the very
    real problems faced by his community, and the important role which the press
    played in addressing them. He also gathered and abstracted 10 rebuttals from
    editors across the country, including his eventual NAACP successor Roy
    Wilkins of the New York Crisis. The exchange concludes with a final letter
    by Gros, who appears to have been at least somewhat enlightened.

    published in the Richmond Times-Dispatch, were music to the ears of the
    white strict segregationists who called themselves the Defenders of State
    Sovereignty and Individual Liberties. They published this flier, which
    consisted of two clippings on Hurston's views, and their short note at the
    end: "It is our sincere belief that the feeling of this noted Negro
    authoress is shared by millions of other fine people, both Negro and white."

  CROSSHEAD: Correspondence regarding Ralph Bunche's rejection by a New York tennis club.
  TYPESET: >-
    9 letters and telegrams to Queens borough president John T. Clancy, and one
    retailed letter written by him; generally minor wear.
  at-a-glance: 'Queens, NY, July 1959'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Ralph Johnson Bunche (1904-1971) was one of the most famous diplomats in the
    United States. With a Ph.D. in political science from Harvard, he had played
    an important role in the founding of the United Nations. He was the chief
    mediator in the negotiations which brought temporary peace in the
    Israeli-Palestine conflict, for which he won the 1949 Nobel Peace Prize.
    <br><br><br><br>With these credentials, he applied to join the West Side
    Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens, NY in 1959. He was rejected on the
    basis of his race--the club explicitly excluded Black applicants. The Queens
    borough president, an Irish-American named John T. Clancy, took a public
    stance on behalf of Bunche in this conflict. <br><br><br><br>Offered here
    are the letters Clancy received in response, which show the wide-ranging
    reactions to his principled stand. A Jewish woman is outraged at the club's
    "recent show of bigotry," while a Jewish man appreciates Clancy's efforts to
    "assure equal treatment for all in our community" (the club also barred
    Jewish members). The Rev. Emmer Booker of a local A.M.E. church praised
    Clancy's "forthright and courageous statement," and the parent's association
    of a local school also praised his stand. Two letter writers offered tepid
    support but mainly complained at length about Clancy's failure to protest
    similar discrimination against Catholic teachers at Queens College.
    <br><br><br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, three constituents were
    not pleased. One man, signing only as "a white taxpayer," accuses Clancy of
    having "sold his soul for a lousy nigger vote" and asks him to "save us from
    becoming an African jungle." It gets worse, if you care to read more.
    Another, signing as "an American of the Jewish faith," was more polite in
    their bigotry, explaining that "there are plenty of Negro clubs, where
    Negroes can feel much more at home, and awkward situations can be avoided."
    Finally, a Kew Gardens woman insists "I do not hate colored people," but
    repeats several scurrilous personal rumors about Bunche, says "he acts like
    a stooge stirring up trouble," and complains that Black fans did not come to
    cheer Black tennis great Althea Gibson when she competed in a tournament at
    the club in 1950. <br><br><br><br>Perhaps not surprisingly, the supportive
    letter writers sign their names, while two of the three racist responders
    sign anonymously. Queens has long been recognized as one of the most diverse
    places in the world, but also as the seat of deeply entrenched racism: home
    of the 1986 Howard Beach murder and of fictional television bigot Archie
    Bunker. In these letters to the borough president, both sides of Queens are
    on full display. <br><br><br><br>Also included is a letter Clancy sent to
    tennis sponsor Harcourt Davis in New Jersey, urging him to move the
    prestigious Davis Cup tournament away from the West Side club because of its
    "rank prejudice and discrimination . . . against our Negro and Jewish
    citizens." The letter was returned to sender, as Clancy apparently did not
    have the inside scoop on contacting wealthy tennis benefactors.

    From the introduction: "This collection of graphic collages has been created
    specifically as a memento for those who participated in the historic March
    on Washington for Freedom and Jobs on August 28, 1963. It depicts man's
    inhumanity, his cruelty to his fellow human being. This memento, we believe,
    will inspire us to assert man's decency and goodness through an
    understanding of anguish." The introduction is signed in facsimile by the
    march leaders including Martin Luther King Jr., A. Philip Randolph, James
    Farmer, Roy Wilkins, and Whitney M. Young Jr. <br><br><br><br>This is the
    most pristine example of the portfolio we have handled. It is accompanied by
    two additional insert cards: an uncompleted card to pledge commitment to the
    ideals of the March; and a card offering a parable of racial prejudice
    titled "An Indian Lesson," produced by the "6200 Champlain Avenue Block
    Club" [Chicago].

    This petition was issued to defend the "Albany Nine," who faced long prison
    sentences in southern Georgia for daring to picket a segregationist store
    owner. The struggles of these Georgia activists are described in detail. The
    boldfaced title, "Marchers for Jobs and Freedom," suggests that a march was
    planned in Georgia. Actually, this petition was handed out in conjunction
    with the 28 August 1963 March for Freedom in Washington. An article of that
    date in the Knoxville News-Sentinel describes its distribution aboard a
    trainload of marchers headed north from Florida: "As the train moved north,
    a white girl wearing glasses--one of a dozen white persons
    aboard--circulated a petition demanding that the federal indictment against
    the Albany Nine be dropped." None traced in OCLC or at auction, though one
    is held among the Eliza Paschall Papers at Emory University.

    A collection of short biographies of Frederick Douglass and eleven white men
    whose reputations today range from moderately well-known (Peter Cooper,
    rival vice presidents Hamlin and Stephens, Charles Francis Adams) to
    completely forgotten. The Douglass portrait is sympathetic and admiring, and
    concludes "It is doubtful if any man, in any country, commencing so low,
    ever climbed so high as did Frederick Douglass." <br><br><br><br>In 1881,
    John Wesley Cromwell founded the Bethel Literary and Historical Association
    to serve Washington's small but growing Black intelligentsia. Frederick
    Douglass attended some of these meetings. Douglass was apparently proud
    enough of his profile in Twelve Americans to give it as a gift, and
    impressed enough with John Wesley Cromwell to make him a recipient.

    This volume bears a gift inscription by the Rev. Jeremiah R.V. Thomas (circa
    1835-after 1880), a significant African Methodist Episcopalian minister in
    the years following the Civil War, in Portsmouth and later in Baltimore and
    New Orleans. The book was given to John Wesley Cromwell (1846-1927), who had
    been freed from slavery as a young boy in 1851, graduated in 1864 from the
    Institute for Colored Youth in Philadelphia, and then in 1865 returned to
    the town where he had been enslaved, Portsmouth, VA, where he opened his own
    school. During this period, weeks after the close of the Civil War, Rev.
    Thomas inscribed the book "J. Wesley Cromwell, presented by Rev. J.R.V.
    Thomas, Portsmouth, Va., June 8, 1865." The subject, the recent history of
    abolitionist ferment in Kansas, would have likely been of interest to the

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Douglass served as the United States Marshal for the District of Columbia
    from 1877 to 1881. His signature as Recorder of Deeds from 1881 onward is
    more often seen, but we are aware of only one other document signed in his
    official capacity as Marshal. <br><br><br><br>This document explains that
    Clayton B. Rogers had successfully sued a defendant on 18 October 1878,
    causing three parcels of land to be put up for public auction, where Rogers
    was then able to purchase the property for $380. Douglass thus deeds the
    property over to Rogers in his official capacity.

    On 15 October 1883, the Supreme Court delivered a decision on what are known
    as "the Civil Rights Cases," ruling that the 13th and 14th Amendments did
    not forbid racial discrimination by private individuals or companies, which
    nullified the Civil Rights Act of 1875. This devastating decision
    essentially provided legal sanction to Jim Crow practices for decades to
    come. <br><br><br><br>A week after the decision, before the opinions were
    even published, a protest meeting was held in Washington. This pamphlet
    records the minutes of the meeting, as well as keynote speeches by Frederick
    Douglass (pages 4-14) and white liberal orator Robert Ingersoll (15-53). The
    Douglass speech ranks as one of his most stirring. He argues that the Civil
    Rights Bill did not establish social equality between the races, it merely
    confirmed what was already clear from the Declaration of Independence, the
    Sermon on the Mount, and the Golden Rule. In conclusion, he notes that "no
    where, outside of the United States, is any man denied civil rights on
    account of his color." Afro-Americana 3236; Blockson 3793.

    An account of a "school for the colored people" opened in an old hotel
    downtown Quitman, GA by northern missionaries. Even as the building was
    prepared for students, the staff endured a steady stream of abuse from the
    locals, including bullets fired through the principal's window at night. The
    school managed to open in early October 1885. On 17 November, it was set on
    fire. Although located one block from the local fire department, no effort
    was made to save the building, only to protect the neighboring buildings
    from falling cinders. No lives were lost, but the staff and students fled
    town. In a final insult, the principal was charged with arson.

    On 4 June 1938, the famed opera singer Marian Anderson was honored by a

    nation's first Black sorority. This album was signed by 47 AKA members, many
    from the Philadelphia-based Omega Omega graduate chapter. Among them was
    Ethel Hedgeman Lyle, considered the founder and guiding light of Alpha Kappa
    Alpha, who urged Anderson to "go on, my dear, work and achieve, for the
    glory of our race." Facing her inscription is her printed portrait. The
    longest inscription is by Ida L. Byrd (also illustrated with a photograph),
    who wrote "Your grace and simplicity are for your whole people an unmatched
    diadem. Phyllis Wheatley, Harriett Tubman and Sojourner Truth hoped and
    prophesied for their race, but you, dear Marian, carry on; you achieve for
    your people!" Six days after this event, Anderson was granted an honorary
    Doctor of Music degree at Howard University, and then embarked on a concert
    tour of Latin America. Her famous Lincoln Memorial concert which cemented
    her international fame was less than a year later. <br><br><br><br>Alpha

    Diary, photographs, and correspondence of modern dance legend Katherine
    Dunham.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Katherine Dunham (1909-2006) was one of the most important American dancers
    of the 20th century. She led her own dance company, and ran her own school
    of dance in New York. A graduate of the University of Chicago, she was an
    accomplished anthropologist and scholar of dance in addition to her career
    on stage, and authored three books. Raised in Joliet, IL, she toured widely
    across several continents, residing at various points in New York,
    Hollywood, Haiti, and Tokyo as a true citizen of the world.
    <br><br><br><br>At the heart of this lot is her 42-page personal diary,
    mostly kept in 1958 while in Tokyo writing her memoir. It is a mix of
    traditional diary entries with bits of memoir and literary reflection. Typed
    passages from earlier volumes and other memoranda are frequently taped,
    stapled, or laid in. The entries range from lyrical landscape descriptions,
    to anthropological observations on Japanese culture, to bracingly frank
    comments on her personal life. Two recurring characters are her Japanese
    maid and the maid's boyfriend, a rockabilly enthusiast who absconded with a
    small sum of money. Dunham attended a Japanese rockabilly concert and
    reflected on its layers of cultural appropriation: “Rockabilly show at
    Nichegeki with teenagers like reeking wet sardines throwing streamers and
    walking on stage embracing match-stick-legged performers in heavy ankle-high
    white rubber-soled moccasins . . . . Imitating Presley who imitates every
    blues shouter there ever was. I think of Joe Turner and Kokomo and Winona of
    Central Avenue when the big-busted oily-haired sisters walked onto the floor
    in ecstasy and put their dollar bills earned in Hollywood cleaning up after
    all-night brawls at Turner’s and Winona’s feet, real ecstasy rocking their
    bodies & shining their eyes. This is so puerile" (2 June 1958). In a similar
    vein, she wrote “When all else has come & gone the Blues will remain deeply,
    securely embedded in the substratum of American culture. Constant reminder
    of Black races. Triumph” (5 February). The blues remained on her mind in
    Tokyo: "The workmen sound like Josh White singing a work song. It will help
    them through the night" (11 February). Among the bits of memoir interweaved
    into the text, she recalls serving as a flower girl at countless funerals in
    Joliet; discusses writing a disturbing passage on her father ("I left off at
    eleven last night unravelling Albert Dunham’s incestuous desire for his
    daughter"); and proclaims “The aggregate of Israelites evacuating the land
    of the pharoas could have felt no greater relief or keener joy than I did
    when I at last left Joliet for good.” Her complex marriage to John Pratt is
    discussed at length in one passage written on 2 November while in Haiti.
    <br><br><br><br>In moments of intellectual detachment came more abstract
    observations: “Only upon the historian, the biographer falls the task of
    accuracy. The rest of us write things as we see them, or as we remember them
    to be. To make them believable, to live. Herein lies our artistry" (21
    April). Typed passages reflect on her philosophy of dance: “For a dancer the
    association must be voluntary, the spirit free, and the flesh willing; the
    aims multiple and common. . . . Perhaps because there is no actual necessity
    for tools, material, artifacts, the dance was perhaps the earliest artistic
    expression—and its psychokinesthetic usage gave it real urgency beyond other
    creative arts. . . . My mission is not to present beauty but to present
    truth. If the two go hand in hand, how fortunate I am.” <br><br><br><br>This
    lot also contains 43 photographs of Dunham and of her dancers. They include
    a postcard-sized photo signed and inscribed to her mother (illustrated);
    another signed by Dunham in East St. Louis circa 1969-70; a group shot of
    her with Jean Cocteau and Josephine Baker at an opening in Paris, 1950; one
    with Maurice Chevalier; a still from her film Stormy Weather, 1943; with her
    troupe being greeted off the airplane in Korea, 1956; and a 13 x 9-inch Life
    Magazine print, 1958. Skipping forward several generations is a pair of
    photographs of hip hop artist Wanda Dee, one of them in her touring role as
    Josephine Baker, both signed and inscribed warmly to Dunham as an elder role
    model, circa 2002. <br><br><br><br>Among the manuscripts found here are
    logistical correspondence and travel documents from her company’s 1953 tour
    of Europe; 2 unsigned carbon letters from a New York associate suggesting
    the closure of her dance school, December 1953; and a 9 January 1954 carbon
    of her letter to manager Wilfred Wyler in New York: “Could you advise me as
    to whether an actual lien has been made on the bank accounts? It looks as
    though I will have to stay out of America for some time! Anyway if we all
    keep trying surely something optimistic will happen.” On the business end
    are draft contracts for her performers, 1948 and 1950; “Notes for Investor’s
    Contract between Katherine Dunham, producer and Mr. Nat Goldstone” in 1947;
    and a draft promotional agreement with her manager Mr. Hurok, 1943. 6
    cancelled checks are preserved with endorsement signatures by Dunham’s
    “Tropical Revue” dancers James Alexander, Gloria Mitchell, Wilbert Bradley,
    Dolores Harper, and most notably two by Eartha Kitt, 1945-46; a clipped
    signature of Langston Hughes dated 8 April 1938 is part of this small

  DESCRIPT: Katherine Dunham.
  CROSSHEAD: Large group of letters by the modern dance star to a close friend.
  TYPESET: >-
    37 letters, most of the Autograph Letters Signed simply as "Calf", to
    assistant and friend Dorothy "Dorf" Gray; plus 5 signed cards, and 7 letters
    from Dunham's other staff members to Gray; condition generally strong. Most
    with original envelopes (some stamps clipped).

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Katherine Dunham (1909-2006) was one of the most important American dancers
    of the 20th century. She wrote these letters starting in the late 1940s,
    mostly while she was touring internationally. The recipient was her friend
    Dorothy Gray (1922-1976) of New York and later North Hollywood, CA, who
    helped manage her stateside affairs. <br><br><br><br>Nine of the letters
    were written in mid-1948, while Dunham was performing in England. On 31 May
    1948, shortly after arriving in London, she writes: "The show so far is
    called Caribbean Rhapsody, the sort of title I loathe. Darling, I've just
    complained. But I'm so very blue and sad & lonely." Four days later, the
    mood has changed: "After two days and two nights without any sleep, the
    entire show came through as a smash. Of course there's nothing like opening
    night, even tho I was on empirin, benzedrine and scotch and hardly knew what
    was happening. The audience went wild and now you can't get near the box
    office." She encloses a clipping of a glowing review. Several letters allude
    to difficulties with her husband and set designer John Pratt. The problems
    of running her famous New York dance school from overseas are a running
    theme, as she wrote on 3 August 1948: "I have absolutely no idea what goes
    on at the school. . . It's very hard to be so in the dark." She also offers
    an inside scoop on the smash hit London production, writing on 20 August
    1948: "I have your wire about Reginald. Please tell him that I am trying to
    work out a deal here with the union to permit him to play in the pit, which
    is against regulation, but as our music is very special and our present
    pianist is having a nervous breakdown and leaving soon, it might be
    arranged."<br><br><br><br>The later letters are written from all over the
    world, including Australia, New Zealand, Haiti, San Francisco, and Japan.
    Australia receives poor reviews on 3 July 1956: "We are playing in a theatre
    which has to date, for at least forty years, had nothing but the cheapest
    kind of vaudeville, a compere telling dirty jokes, some acrobats, some
    tumblers, few semi-nudes and the dancing girls. . . . I should imagine that
    a year altogether would be possible here, but I turn pale at the thought."
    Those looking for celebrity references will find a few. Dunham was rumored
    to be in an affair with famed psychologist Erich Fromm. She wrote on 18
    August 1948: "Enjoying the books greatly. Could you send Dr. Fromm's Escape
    from Freedom?" 30 June 1958 found her featured in Life Magazine: "Life
    worked me to death for two days with photographs & story. They're doing the
    14 outstanding negroes in a big spread. Hard to believe they thought of me
    along with Ralph Bunche, Gen. Davis, etc. Made me very nervous." Despite her
    fame and critical success, keeping a large dance company on the road kept
    her finances in a precarious state. She wrote on 5 October 1961: "I cabled
    both [former student Eartha] Kitt and Julie in desperation last week.
    Negative from Kitt's manager, no answer at all from the Belafontes."
    Dunham's work as an author and anthropologist is also noted, though in less
    detail than the nuts and bolts of her dance tours. <br><br><br><br>These
    letters put Dunham's personality on vivid display: razor-sharp intelligence,
    deep and genuine concern for her friends, commitment to her art, and a flair
    for the dramatic. Her letters are almost uniformly entertaining. We know of
    no other Dunham archives which have appeared at auction, and yet here are
    two unrelated lots from different consignors in the same sale (see above).

    Ira Frederick Aldridge (1807-1867) was an African-American actor who was
    born in New York but emigrated in 1824 in search of greater opportunities.
    He slowly worked his way up through the regional theaters of Great Britain
    and Ireland, often billing himself as a native of Africa. He was brought in
    to play Othello at Covent Garden's Theatre Royal for his first opportunity
    at one of London's leading theaters. His engagement as Othello lasted for
    only two performances, but he went on to a long career as one of England's
    leading actors. He is the only actor of African descent to be honored with a
    plaque at the Shakespeare Memorial Theater. <br><br><br><br>This playbill
    advertises Aldridge's groundbreaking first Covent Garden appearance as
    Othello. It promises a performance two days hence of "Shakespeare's tragedy
    of Othello, the part of Othello by Mr. Aldridge, known by the appellation of
    the African Roscius, who has been received with great applause at the
    Theatres Royal, Dublin, Edinburgh, Bath, and most of the principal
    provincial theatres. (His first appearance on this stage.)" See Hovde, "Ira
    Aldridge Takes the Stage," on the Folger Shakespeare Library blog, which is
    illustrated with a 10 April playbill. A pair of double-sized broadsides from
    Aldridge's Covent Garden performances appeared in Swann's 28 March 2019

    The Hyers family were groundbreaking figures who brought Black musical
    theater to the general public. Singing and acting sisters Anna Madah Hyers
    and Emma Louise Hyers were managed by their father Samuel B. Hyers. "Out of
    Bondage" was their best-known production, a story of slavery and
    emancipation with a Black cast--here including the important actor Sam
    Lucas, in his first major role outside of the minstrel shows where he began
    his career. The performance advertised here offers an act-by-act synopsis of
    the plot for Out of Bondage and a full cast list. The play debuted in 1875
    or 1876, but we find this cast (particularly Celestine Brown on piano)
    mentioned in newspapers only from May to November 1877.

    continued to play them for more than 30 years. Uncle Tom was played by "Cool
    White", the white minstrel performer John Hodges, who performed with the
    Howard company from 1879 and 1882. Among the supporting cast were "genuine
    Southern Colored Folk--Men, Women and Children"--most of whom were slaves in
    Georgia, Alabama and Virginia prior to the war," as well as the "Virginia
    Colored Slave Troupe of Jubilee Singers." The performance took place at the

    We hope somebody can explain this one for us. Here in the deep south, at the
    height of the Klan's second heyday, a town holds a large Veteran's Day
    celebration to dedicate a new bridge--and they make a point to invite the
    "Negroes of Putnam and Adjoining Counties" to the celebration. Furthermore,
    the keynote speaker was the president of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical
    College, an historically Black college. In closing, the local African
    Americans are assured this is no joke: "The citizens of Palatka mean for you
    to come and bring your wives and children. Come and enjoy one long free day
    of festivity; see our bridge, schools, and churches." <br><br><br><br>The
    celebration was held in Palatka, a small inland city west of Jacksonville,
    FL. Putnam County had some glimmers of progressive racial attitudes. Their
    former sheriff, Peter Hagan, had resisted lynchings and Klan activity at
    great personal risk, but he had been voted out of office in 1924. That
    ushered in two years of Klan violence--dozens of horrific incidents against
    Blacks and Catholics. The better elements eventually prevailed, with the
    threat of a state investigation cooling down the incidents in 1926, and
    Hagan was re-elected in 1928. See "Ku Klux Klan met its match in Putnam
    County in the 1920s," Tampa Bay Times, 24 October 2012. <br><br><br><br>Klan
    or no, the town apparently went ahead with its integrated celebration in
    1927. The Memorial Bridge remained in service until replaced by an
    identically named bridge in 1976; a World War One memorial which was also

    First edition. Often credited as the first cookbook by an African American,
    the work goes well beyond cookery. It is a comprehensive guide to the
    management of an elite household--one of the few careers open to Black men
    during this period. Sections are devoted to table service, "answering the
    bells," coal heat, and recipes for various cleaning agents. Pages 120-153
    are devoted to cookery, marketing, and table service. The author Robert
    Roberts (circa 1780-1860) was born in South Carolina, probably into slavery,
    and came north to New England by 1805. He served as head butler to wealthy
    Bostonians, most notably former governor Christopher Gore, while becoming
    increasingly active in local politics and the abolition movement. After
    Gore's death in 1827, Roberts ended his career as a butler and worked as a
    stevedore until his own death in 1860. "Among the very first books written
    by an African American and issued by a commercial house, the book was
    certainly written with Gore's permission and perhaps with his financial
    support"--introduction to the 2016 edition of the House Servant's Directory,

    and already the seeds of divisions are showing. He carries a suspicious
    spirit against the men who have best served the republic. He only dreams of
    plots, gatherings, and uprising"). In closing, he assures his correspondent
    that the nation's formerly enslaved leadership embraced the rule of law:
    "les noirs ont reçus leurs anciens maitres à bras ouverts. . . . Ils seront
    toujour bons, humains et amis des lois" ("the Blacks received their former

    message that the Prophets Noah, Lot, Abraham and Moses delivered to their
    people; A warning to separate from the people God will destroy, and flee for

  CROSSHEAD: Early draft of the Letter from Birmingham Jail.
  TYPESET: >-
    11 period Xeroxed pages, 11 x 8½ inches, staple-bound in upper left corner;

  at-a-glance: 'Birmingham, AL, 16 April 1963 (printed shortly after)'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Offered here is a possibly unique prepublication draft of "Letter from
    Birmingham Jail," which remains one of Martin Luther King's most enduring
    works. It was written under difficult circumstances. King and the Southern
    Christian Leadership Conference carried out non-violent protests in
    Birmingham, Alabama in defiance of a local judge's injunction. He was
    arrested on 12 April 1963. That day, eight local white clergymen penned a
    "Call for Unity" in the local newspaper, urging demonstrators to seek
    redress through the courts rather than by following outside agitators and
    disobeying the law. From his cell, King penned an enduring deconstruction of
    his moderate fellow clergymen, making the case for civil disobedience in the
    face of unjust laws. <br><br><br><br>The letter began on jumbled notes on
    scraps of paper smuggled to King by a prison guard, and as King and the SCLC
    staff recognized its power, it went through various revisions and was
    distributed locally to churches before making its first partial print
    appearance on 19 May 1963. From there, it appeared in hundreds of different
    publications--books, newspapers, magazines, and in pamphlet form, often with
    subtle textual variations. Although King's original manuscript has long
    since disappeared, several early drafts of the "Letter from Birmingham Jail"
    have been traced by Stanford University's King Papers Project. No other
    examples of the present draft have been found. <br><br><br><br>The textual
    history of the Letter has been discussed in several books on King, showing
    that several typescripts were prepared by at least two different teams of
    SCLC members using different typewriters, led by Wyatt Tee Walker and Addine
    Drew (see Diane McWhorter, Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama, The Climactic
    Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution, pages 354 and 390). E. Culpepper
    Clark in a 1993 essay noted that "a duplicated copy of the letter did
    circulate in Birmingham, but the date of its distribution is not known" (see
    “The American Dilemma in King's 'Letter from Birmingham Jail,'” in
    Calloway-Thomas and Lucaites, Martin Luther King Jr. and the Sermonic Power
    of Public Discourse, page 35). In 2001, S. Jonathan Bass wrote "Adding to
    the confusion surrounding the letter's production were the slightly
    different versions of the document produced by the SCLC publicity corps"
    (Blessed Are the Peacemakers, page 138). A 2013 book asserted that
    "Mimeographed copies of the 'Letter' appeared in black churches in May"
    (Jonathan Rieder, Gospel of Freedom: Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Letter from
    Birmingham Jail, page 103). <br><br><br><br>The present 11-page draft is in
    single-spaced format and electrostatically duplicated, while most other
    pre-publication typed drafts are 19 to 22 pages in length, double-spaced and
    mimeographed. It generally follows the earliest known complete drafts of the
    letter, but differs in dozens of places from most standard published
    versions, and also in some places from the other known early drafts--in both
    text and formatting. For example, on page 5, "higher moral law" has been
    changed to "mighter moral law." In published versions, King quotes a series
    of religious leaders: "Was not Martin Luther an extremist? -- 'Here I stand;
    I can do no other so help me God.' Was not John Bunyan an extremist? -- 'I
    will stay in jail to the end of my days.'" In the present copy, on page 7,
    Luther's quote is omitted and Bunyan's quote given to him, so it reads "Was
    not Martin Luther an extremist? -- "I will stay in jail to the end of my
    days.'" A color-coded annotated guide accompanies the lot (adapted from a
    documentary edition of the text in the 2001 Bass book), showing many
    differences between this and other early drafts. The consignor's extensive
    research and correspondence notes are also
    included.<br><br><br><br>Provenance: acquired with papers of the
    Inter-Citizens Committee, which worked to investigate and publicize cases of
    police brutality and harassment in Birmingham from 1960 to 1965, and thence

    Luther King, Jr. Papers Project at Stanford University.

  at-a-glance: 'Atlanta, GA, 17 January 1968'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Any piece of oratory by Dr. King is a part of the nation's heritage, but
    this is not just any speech. It was given at a planning meeting for the last
    of his great protest movements: the Poor People's Campaign. The audience was
    a large group of leaders and staff of the Southern Christian Leadership
    Conference which he had founded and led for ten years as his primary vehicle
    for activism. Here before his most loyal followers, we can hear shouts of
    affirmation and rueful laughter from the audience. <br><br><br><br>The
    stakes were high; the Poor People's Campaign would soon be publicized and
    launched, but the group was still debating its tactics and list of demands.
    King told the Atlanta Constitution that an "idea task force" was presently
    preparing demands for Congress, adding that "we're trying to provide an
    alternative to the long hot summer" (17 January 1968).
    <br><br><br><br>King's central argument was the need to reach Washington on
    the side of justice, without getting slowed down by the details: "We are
    moving around the right issue. It’s a simple thing. Jobs are income. , , ,
    We are talking about bread now. We are talking about the right to eat, the
    right to live, this is what we're going to Washington about. . . . The
    nation needs this. We don’t have to worry about just jobs or income. Let’s
    get to Washington. And after we get there, and stay a few days, call the
    peace movement in. . . . I don’t know what Jesus had as his demands, other
    than ‘Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand.’ My demand in Washington is
    Repent, America!"<br><br><br><br>The power of demonstrations, if channeled
    to non-violence, is discussed at length: "The nation needs a movement now. .
    . . and I say to you that many of our confusions are dissolved, they are
    distilled in demonstrations. . . . They have served the purpose of giving
    people new senses of dignity and destiny." Apparently motioning to SCLC
    staff member Lester Hankerson, a former street gang leader, he said "Lester
    wouldn’t be here today if there hadn’t been some demonstrations around
    Savannah, he’d probably be out there in jail somewhere, not for
    demonstrations but for other reasons. But Lester became a man, and a person
    committed to moral purposes, through demonstrations. The sociologists don’t
    write about it much, but whenever you have demonstrations in a community,
    the crime rate goes down." Demonstrations were King's tool and he had
    clearly thought through their impact: “In dangerous moments, people begin to
    hold hands that didn't know they could hold them. The question of black and
    white goes out in a demonstration. We will argue it philosophically, but out
    on that line, black folk and white folk get together in a strange way. And
    I’m saying many of the things we argue about, segregation or integration,
    will be dealt with in demonstrations. . . . The nation needs a movement. And
    the questions we argue about, violence and non-violence, will be dealt with
    in a demonstration. . . . Hope is the final refusal to give up. In this
    sense it has a medicinal quality. . . . As we go into these communities, we
    go with the hope that we can move this sick nation away from at least a
    level of its sickness."<br><br><br><br>King also uses a series of analogies
    and parables to make his points--some religious, some not. He calls upon the
    national religion of baseball by recounting a rousing walk-off victory by
    his beloved Brooklyn Dodgers, who he had rooted for since Jackie Robinson's
    arrival in 1947. Oddly enough, his central parable is about the great
    19th-century Norwegian violinist Ole Bull, who is said to have broken his A
    string just after the intermission of his performance. Rather than give up
    in despair, Bull improvised a transposition of the whole performance to the
    three remaining strings and finished flawlessly. You might not be able to
    turn a story about a long-dead Norwegian violinist into a powerful metaphor,
    but you are not Martin Luther King. He reflected upon the victories and
    stumbles of the SCLC over the past seven years: "We don't have much. The
    people we are going to be recruiting don't have much. Their A strings have
    broken. We in this movement have had our disappointments, we’ve had our
    failures, we’ve had our moments of agony. Our A strings are broken. We went
    to Albany, Georgia and things didn’t come out like we wanted to see them
    come out, and everybody said SCLC is finished, movement is finished, the A
    string broke down in Albany, but we transposed the composition in Birmingham
    and finished on three strings. Some people say we failed in Chicago. I
    haven’t concluded that, but we certainly didn’t do everything in Chicago
    that we set out to do. And I never will forget one day an agreement was
    reached, and Chicago didn’t live up to that agreement. A string broke, I
    look back over, and I wish we had gone to Cicero now, but don’t worry about
    these things, you make mistakes, in any game. If you run your football down
    the goal, don’t be upset about fumbling the ball, just try and recover it.
    We are going to Washington and we are going to transpose the composition."
    King apparently saw the Poor People's Campaign as a way to redeem the
    Chicago Freedom Movement, which had ended with a fizzle in 1966 when some of
    his more radical supporters had instead wanted to march on the white suburb
    of Cicero. <br><br><br><br>King drives toward his conclusion with a series
    of rhetorical flourishes like a fireworks display: "That is a law in this
    universe: when it is dark enough, you can see the stars. There is a law in
    this universe, no lie can live forever. There is a law in this universe,
    truth crushed to earth will rise again. . . . I go away with this faith. I
    don’t know if I’ll see all of you before April, but I send you forth as
    Jesus said to his disciples as sheep amid wolves, be ye as strong and as
    tough as a serpent and as tender as a dove and we will be able to do
    something that will give new meaning to our own lives, I hope new meaning to
    the life of the nation. I may not see you before, but I'll meet you in
    Washington." King never made it to Washington to see the launch of the
    campaign. <br><br><br><br>This tape has 23½ minutes of King's speech,
    beginning in mid-sentence but apparently near the beginning of his remarks.
    The remarks are repeated twice on the tape, with the second appearance much
    clearer in sound. More extensive notes transcribed from King's remarks are

    When Martin Luther King was shot on the balcony of his Memphis hotel, Joseph
    Louw (1939-2003) was the only photographer on the scene. Louw was a
    mixed-race South African who had fled to America after breaking his
    country's apartheid laws. In April 1968, he was following Dr. King for the
    Public Broadcasting Laboratory. He was in his hotel room when the shots rang
    out, and rushed out to the balcony to capture this iconic image, as King's
    aides pointed to the rooftop from where the shots had been fired. Louw's
    negatives were developed at a Time-Life darkroom in New York. Early print
    appearances of the photograph such as in the May 1968 issue of Ebony credit
    him as a photographer for "Public Broadcast Laboratory @ Time, Inc.,"
    similar to the credit stamp in the present example; it is substantially
    larger than the typical press photo. Louw returned to Africa the following
    year and remained far from the spotlight.

    The first appearance of Wheatley's fourth published poem, and her first
    magazine appearance of any kind--preceded only by a broadside, a pamphlet
    printing, and newspaper appearances. Her book, "Poems on Various Subjects,
    Religious and Moral," was published in London the following year.
    <br><br><br><br>The poem appears here on pages 134-135. It is prefaced by a
    short note from a Boston subscriber describing Wheatley: "There is in this
    town a young Negro woman, who left her country at ten years of age, and has
    been in this eight years. She is . . . an accomplished mistress of her pen,
    and discovers a most surprising genius. . . . The following was occasioned
    by her being in company with some young ladies of family, when one of them
    said she did not remember, among all the poetical pieces she had seen, ever
    to have met with a poem upon Recollection. The African (so let me call her,
    for so in fact she is) took the hint, went home to her master's, and soon
    sent what follows." The poem is further prefaced with a dedication note by
    the author, who is attributed only as "Your very humble servant,
    Phillis."<br><br><br><br>The poem begins with a plea to Mneme, the Greek
    muse of memory, to "inspire . . . your vent'rous Afric in the deep design."
    It was revised substantially for its book appearance the following year,
    including that line (changed to "your vent'rous Afric in her great design").

    Newspaper and Magazine Notices during the Years of Fame, 1765-1774," in The

    First edition. Phillis Wheatley (circa 1753-1784) was born in Senegal and
    sold into American slavery when she was about eight years old. She was
    permitted an unusual degree of formal education by her owner, a Boston
    merchant named John Wheatley, who encouraged her literary efforts. On a
    visit to England in 1773, she arranged the publication of this volume of
    poems, and was given her manumission shortly afterward. Her poetry came to
    the attention of George Washington, Thomas Paine, John Paul Jones, and
    Thomas Jefferson, but she nonetheless worked as a scullery maid to pay her
    bills, and died in poverty at the age of 31. <br><br>This volume includes,
    in addition to Wheatley's poems, a dedication to the Countess of Huntington
    who had sponsored the publication, Wheatley's two-page preface, and an
    endorsement by her owner John Wheatley. It also includes a remarkable
    endorsement by a board of 17 distinguished Bostonians including Governor
    Thomas Hutchinson and future governor John Hancock, announcing that "we
    whose names are under-written, do assure the World, that the Poems . . .
    were (as we verily believe) written by Phillis, a young Negro Girl, who was
    but a few Years since, brought an uncultivated Barbarian from Africa, and
    has ever since been, and now is, under the Disadvantage of serving as a
    Slave in a Family in this Town." <br><br>The iconic frontispiece portrait of
    Wheatley is present and well-preserved. It is often credited to Scipio
    Moorhead, who much like Wheatley practiced his craft while in a state of
    slavery in Boston. A poem in this volume is dedicated to him: "To S.M. a
    young African Painter, on seeing his works" (pages 114-5). <br><br>In the
    annals of African-American literature, Wheatley's Poems on Various Subjects
    was preceded only by poems in broadside or short pamphlet form (by Jupiter
    Hammon and Wheatley herself), and by the 1770 Narrative of the Most
    Remarkable Particulars by James Gronniosaw, who had spent many years as a
    slave and freedman in America, but published his narrative after settling in
    England. Afro-Americana 11111; Blockson, One Hundred and One, 68; Church

    The article "Literaturas de los Negros" begins with a biography of the poet
    Phillis Wheatley, and Spanish translations of three of her poems are

    Infant"); "Himno de la Mañana" ("An Hymn to the Morning"); and "Al Conde
    Darmouth" ("To the Rt. Hon. William, Earl Of Dartmouth"). They are taken
    from Henri Gregore's 1808 "De la littérature des Nègres," and thus
    presumably translated from English to French to Spanish. They appear to be
    the first Spanish-language translations of Wheatley's work in print.
    <br><br><br><br>The volume is a complete compilation of the 12 issues of a

    Lord Byron. An article on William / Guillermo Miller, the British-born hero
    of Chilean and Peruvian independence, appears on pages 64-70, and a

    Author and educator Nellie Rathbone Bright (1898-1977) was best known for
    her work on the 1920s literary magazine Black Opals (see lot 264). A
    University of Pennsylvania graduate, she spent 17 years as a principal in
    the Philadelphia school system. Offered here are a wide-ranging variety of
    letters addressed to Bright over the course of her career, a few of them
    referencing her work on Black Opals. Highlights include:
    <br><br><br><br>Autograph Letter Signed from notable artist Laura Wheeler
    Waring (1887-1948). Addressed to the members of the Laura Wheeler Art Club
    at the Durham School where Bright taught, it thanks the students for a
    Christmas handkerchief. An additional personal note to Bright is inserted.
    The artist participated in the Harmon Foundation’s first exhibition for
    African American art later that year. Westchester, PA, 7 January 1927.
    <br><br><br><br>A pair of Autograph Letters Signed from author Jessie Redmon
    Fauset Harris (1882-1961), former editor of the Crisis. In the first she
    writes after a visit to Bright: "Everything in your home helped me--the
    lovely house, the fire, the rum, the lunch, and the good talk. I enjoyed
    those few moments of confidence between us." The second describes her
    pleasant vacation in Atlantic City, NJ: "I don't imagine the board-walk has
    its equal anywhere. All along I kept thinking of what a lovely, spontaneous
    talk we had, and also of those poems. I hope you will finish them up."
    Montclair, NJ, 10 February and 9 July 1948. <br><br><br><br>Letter Signed
    from composer Alton A. Adams, a native of the Virgin Islands and the first
    Black bandmaster in the United States Navy. He reflects on the death of
    Black Lutheran minister Daniel E. Wiseman, and concludes with a discussion
    of his own work: "Enclosed you'll find a picture of my band. . . . They are
    a fine bunch. We have a good band now. My work has been specially commended
    to the Navy Department by the command here. . . . I will organize and head a
    Virgin Islands navy band by authority of the Navy Department." He encloses a
    Real Photo postcard of his Virgin Islands Navy Band. Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 7
    October 1942. <br><br><br><br>Letter Signed from attorney Raymond Pace
    Alexander, inviting Bright to a meeting with Carter Woodson to start a
    Philadelphia chapter of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and
    History. Philadelphia, 7 November 1927. <br><br><br><br>Pair of letters
    signed by James H. Young, Bright's collaborator on Black Opals. About a
    rival publication, he writes: "I have seen Lightning . . . but as you say
    Black Opals undoubtedly will surpass it in every detail, at least I am sure
    everyone will catch our point of view." Germantown, PA, circa 1928.
    <br><br><br><br>Autograph Letter Signed from Black opera singer Florence
    Cole-Talbert (1890-1961), a mentor to Marian Anderson: "I have received
    Black Opals. . . . I am happy to see the names of new young writers among
    your contributors. . . . I am to sing with the Los Angeles Symphony
    Orchestra Jan. 28 and it will be broadcasted by KFJ." Los Angeles, CA, 7

    Younger Negro Artists"; mailing folds, one word added in manuscript, minimal

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    "Fire!!" was a controversial and extremely short-lived literary magazine
    edited by Wallace Thurman (1902-1934). Ahead of its time for its frank
    discussion of interracial romance, prostitution, and homosexuality, it met
    with a hostile response from the old guard of the Black press, and folded
    shortly after the release of its November 1926 first issue when its offices
    burned. <br><br><br><br>This circular letter, sent in the brief window
    between the first issue and the magazine's demise, seeks donations and/or
    subscriptions. Listed alongside Thurman on the editorial staff are a
    cavalcade of heavyweights: Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Gwendolyn
    Bennett, and Aaron Douglas (who may well have done the art for this
    letterhead). Thurman writes: “Dear Friend: The first issue of FIRE has
    blazed its way into the historic annals of the American Negroe literary
    movement. . . . FIRE was and is a literary experiment. . . . You have no
    doubt seen the first issue, and have been either flabbergasted, shocked,
    surprised, or pleased. At any rate you have been provoked to some emotion. .
    . . Now won’t you do your share and send us either a subscription or a
    patron’s check?”

    caption reads "Negro Bus Boy is Poetry Prize Winner. One night he was just
    one of the Negro bus boys scurrying here and there with empty dishes, ice,
    water bottles and more butter--and the next day he was Langston Hughes,
    prize winner of a poetry competition conducted by a magazine of national

  CROSSHEAD: Letter denying press reports that he had dinner with Fidel Castro.
  TYPESET: >-
    Letter Signed to New York Post columnist Leonard Lyons. One page, 8½ x 5¼
    inches, on his personal letterhead; mailing folds, minimal wear.
  at-a-glance: 'New York, 27 September 1960'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Fidel Castro, having recently consolidated his power as leader of Cuba, came
    to New York in September 1960 for the General Assembly of the United
    Nations. In the midst of the Cold War, Castro used this opportunity to
    deepen his alliance with the Soviet Union and accelerated his opposition to
    the United States. He stayed at the Theresa Hotel in Harlem, where a group
    called Fair Play for Cuba Committee hosted a dinner for him on 22 September.
    A popular syndicated columnist from the New York Post, Leonard Lyons,
    claimed that Hughes was in attendance--not an absurd claim, as Hughes had
    been deeply involved in leftist politics and causes as a young man, although
    he had become less overtly political by 1960. In this remarkable letter,
    Hughes categorically denies the columnist's assertion: <br><br><br><br>"Dear
    Leonard Lyons, Just to put into writing the information I gave you today on
    the phone; in reference to the item in your LYONS DEN today where, like
    Daniel, I have been caught: I received no invitation to dine with or to meet
    Castro. I have never met Castro. I was not a guest at dinner Friday night or
    any other time at the Hotel Theresa or elsewhere with Castro. There have
    been about 20 phone calls this afternoon, including other newspapers
    calling. And just now Claudia McNeil of RAISIN IN THE SUN phoned from Boston
    to breathe a prayer for me in case it were true I had dined with such a
    'Satanic person.' Claudia, as you probably know, is Catholic. I told her I'd
    been in the country working on the 10th version of my Theatre Guild play,
    TAMBOURINES TO GLORY, and knew nothing of it all, until I read it in your
    column. With cordial regards, and best wishes to you for a continued mass
    readership, Sincerely yours, Langston Hughes." <br><br><br><br>The Swann
    staff was not at the Hotel Theresa that night, so we can't say for certain
    what really happened--but a simple Internet search for Langston Hughes and
    Fidel Castro will turn up hundreds of modern sources stating that Hughes was
    there. We are inclined, however, to believe Hughes on this point.

    The author of this series, Dr. Edward Bliss Foote (1829-1906) was a white
    physician, birth control and public hygiene advocate, and civil rights
    advocate. This very unusual series introduces children to medicine and
    anatomy via a young Black man and his pet, a "troublesome monkey." Foote
    covered some difficult territory in Volume 5, which bears a preface that
    some may find it "unsuitable to children." The female and male reproduction
    systems are shown in graphic (but not very erotic) cutaways on pages 180½
    and 180¾ ("this leaf can be cut out if thought advisable"). Yet more
    controversially, Sammy is described as escorting young Miss Julia Barkenstir
    to her home, where he gave her a not very platonic kiss goodnight in the
    doorway--shown here in a half-page engraving on page 203. It is believed to
    be the first interracial kiss depicted in the United States. The
    "Publishers' Announcement" on pages 228-230 of Volume 1 reveals that the
    numerous illustrations throughout the volumes are mostly from original
    pen-and-ink sketches by prominent illustrator Henry Louis Stephens. Blockson

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    A list of soldiers who enlisted in the 2nd Massachusetts Regiment from
    Hanover, MA circa March 1777. The regiment fought under Colonel John Bailey
    at the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777, suffered through the long winter
    at Valley Forge, and then saw further combat in the Battle on Monmouth in
    June 1778. At least two of the soldiers on this list were Black: Cuffe
    Tilden and Prince Bailey. The list names 34 soldiers in all, including
    Tilden, Bailey and 9 others who were paid £14 recruitment bounties; 5 who
    were later drafted on 15 May 1777; and 19 including Colonel Bailey who are
    simply listed, in a different hand. <br><br><br><br>Cuffe Tilden had been
    raised in slavery in Hanover, MA as the property of Job Tilden, who was his
    town's leading slave merchant. Cuffe died with his regiment at Valley Forge
    in January 1778. <br><br><br><br>Prince Bailey served a full three-year term
    with the 2nd Massachusetts, was married in Hanover in October 1780, and
    survived to apply for a pension in 1817. In his application he explained:
    "When I was about eight years of age, I was stolen from Africa, my native
    country, and brought to America; my native name was Prince Dunsick--but on
    my arrival I was called by my master’s name which was Bailey. . . . I never
    lived with my old master Bailey afterwards, and resumed my former name of
    Dunsick." See Crowder, African Americans and American Indians in the
    Revolutionary War, page 17. He lived in Maine after the war, and died in
    1838.

    The earlier of these two documents is a pay order receipt, "Received . . .
    to secure the Payment of twenty-eight pounds . . . being the Balance due to
    Sam'l Pomp on the first Day of January last." It was signed by Eben Ledyard
    "in behalf of s'd Pomp" in Hartford, CT on 23 October 1780. The docketing on
    verso explains that the payment was for Pomp's service in the 1st Regiment.
    <br><br><br><br>The second document is a pay bond: "The State of Connecticut
    doth owe unto Samuel Pomp who hath served in the Connecticut Line of the
    Continental Army, the sum of Three Pounds . . . which sum shall be paid to
    him or his Order at this Office" in June 1787 "with Lawful Interest
    thereof." It is signed by Peter Colt as treasurer, Hartford, 1 June 1782.
    The army which defeated the British was determined, but not well funded.
    Soldiers (white and black) were often paid with nearly worthless paper
    money, or in bonds--a promise that they would be repaid for their service
    after the war. <br><br><br><br>Samuel Pomp served for 7 months at the outset
    of the war in 1775 in the 6th Connecticut Regiment under Colonel Samuel
    Holden Parsons, a unit which helped capture Fort Ticonderoga and Crown

    <br><br><br><br>Elmer Lawrence Corthell (1840-1916), who employed Gabriel,
    had been a student at Brown University when the war broke out, enlisted as a
    private in the 1st Rhode Island Light Artillery, and then joined the officer
    ranks with the new Battery H in October 1862. As an officer with Battery H,
    he was mainly in and near Washington, seeing little combat. After his
    transfer to Battery G in early November 1863, he soon saw action at the
    Battle of Rappahannock Station, and then wintered at the major Union supply
    depot at Brandy Station in northern Virginia, where he remained through May.
    Gabriel quite possibly joined him that winter at Brandy Station, which was
    an active destination for "contraband" refugees from slavery.

    Margaret Perkins Simmons (1921-1996) was born in Texas and was living in
    Washington, DC in late 1943 when she enlisted in the Women's Army Corps. She
    served in the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion--the only overseas
    battalion composed entirely of Black women. This collection consists mostly
    of photographs, including 4 English press photos of her battalion marching
    in formation in Birmingham, England, [1945]; 7 postcard-sized photographs of
    the battalion marching in formation; 2 formal color portraits of Simmons
    (one of them signed by Congressman Adam Clayton Powell); and 39 other
    personal photographs of Simmons and her fellow WACs and their wartime
    travels in Europe. Among the war-related ephemera is a letter of thanks from
    President Truman with his printed signature; and a clipping naming Simmons
    as guitarist in a 10-piece WAC orchestra. Among the numerous civilian papers
    are a card issued to Simmons by the New York Institute of Photography in
    1939; and a group of 16 entertainment-industry publicity photographs of
    minor celebrities, some signed, and at least one with a "Photo by Simmons"
    stamp. As Margaret Fouche, she settled in the San Francisco area after the
    war.

    a veteran of Fletcher Henderson's orchestra. The photographs show the band
    and actors at work, as well as a crowd of uniformed soldiers watching from

    Ola A. Mayo (born 1918) was raised as one of 12 children in rural Moneta,
    VA, and by 1940 had moved to Washington, DC to work as a domestic. In 1941
    she married Sheppard A. Brandon (1919-1977), who joined the army the
    following year. Sheppard appears just a couple of times, as a civilian.
    Several other relatives in uniform do appear, including brothers William,
    Edward, and Samuel Mayo, and brother-in-law Sergeant Willie F. Brandon. Ola
    also seems to have found new work during the war. One snapshot shows her

    The Fisk Jubilee Singers were launched in 1871, and proved to be successful
    fundraisers for their cash-strapped university. Soon after, the Hampton
    Institute followed suit with their own touring group of singers. The first
    page is a program for the performance listing 14 songs. The center pages are
    headed by a note explaining that "The Hampton Students were nearly all born
    in slavery, and their music is a faithful rendering of the songs peculiar to
    slave life," over a facsimile manuscript endorsement of the group signed by
    26 prominent clergymen. The rear page features a large engraving of the
    Hampton Institute's Virginia Hall. <br><br><br><br>This particular flier
    advertises a concert at Plymouth Church in Brooklyn Heights, which had been
    a focal point of the New York abolitionist movement under its founding
    pastor Henry Ward Beecher (brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe). Rev. Beecher
    was still on the scene when this concern was held in 1875, but was in the
    throes of a tabloid sex scandal. Not only does his facsimile signature grace
    the centerfold endorsement, his is the first name to appear.

    drop as a single on 4 July and become an enormous rock-rap crossover hit.
    Opening act Whodini had been recording since 1982 and was at the peak of

    The Messenger was founded by labor leader A. Philip Randolph and writer
    Chandler Owen, both of them active socialists. It featured a mix of
    literature, semi-radical political commentary, less-radical business
    boosterism, and humor, with an emphasis on Black authors. It sometimes used
    the tag lines "World's Greatest Negro Monthly" and "New Opinion of the New
    Negro." Offered here are a special September Labor Day issue with a "Message
    to Negro Workers" by white labor leader Samuel Gompers, an exposé on "White
    Supremacy in Organized labor," and more. The November issue is a special
    "Negro Business Achievement Number," also featuring the first installment of
    the serialized story "Seven Years for Rachel" by the magazine's theater
    critic Theophilus Lewis. The December issue is sardonically titled "Peace on
    Earth, Good Will to Man," superimposed over a horrific color depiction of a
    Klan lynching by artist W.B. Williams. Inside, an article on "Manufacturing
    Toilet Articles: A Big Negro Business" takes a long look at Madam C.J.
    Walker's company (she also took out a full-page ad on the back cover), and a
    small feature on "Black Supremacy in Baseball" asks two decades too soon
    "Who are America's best players? Is there any reason why these Negroes
    should not play in the big leagues?" The magazine also had a running feature
    called "These Colored United States," with in-depth looks at various states;
    Mississippi, Florida, and Illinois ("Mecca of the Migrant Mob") are featured
    in these issues. Despite the magazine's popularity and importance, we find
    no issues at auction and none currently listed on ABE.

    Jeremiah Gunderway (1787-1875) spent his life in and near the Massachusetts
    coastal town of Scituate, south of Boston. He was a well-known river pilot,
    steering the town's distinctive gundalows full of salt hay to farms along
    the shore. He is discussed at length in Briggs's 1887 history of the town,
    "History of Shipbuilding on North River," page 59, where this portrait is
    reproduced on the facing page. Among his accomplishments, Gunderway beat
    alcoholism, going without a drink for the last 40 years of his life,
    although he replaced that addiction with a raisin habit that sometimes
    exceeded half a pound a day.

    James Conway Farley (1855-after 1910) of Richmond, VA is regarded as "the

    opened his own Jefferson Fine Art Studio in 1895 or 1896. According to the
    Richmond directories and newspapers, the Jefferson studio was at 523 East
    Broad Street through 1906. Farley worked at 627 East Broad in 1907 and 1908.
    He appeared as a photographer in Jersey City, NJ in the 1910 census before

    Heritage, was in 1970 the first photographer to be awarded a Young Humanist
    Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Humanities, and in 1994

    Beth Lomax Howes Award from the National Endowment for the Arts in
    recognition of his career of documentary photography and exhibition work.
    These two lots are, so far as we know, the first of his prints to appear at

    the Poor People's Campaign with a speech in poverty-stricken Marks,
    Mississippi. He was assassinated the next week, but the campaign continued
    in his memory. One of the signature actions was a caravan of mule-drawn
    wagons travelling from Marks to Washington, evoking the legacy of
    sharecropping, poverty and institutional racism. Roland Freeman accompanied
    the Mule Train as a photographer, as documented in his 1998 book, "The Mule
    Train: A Journey of Hope Remembered." Here he captures a wagon as it crosses
    the line from Lowndes County, Mississippi toward the town of Reform,

    The Blaine Invincible Republican Club was chartered in 1876, and was
    discussed frequently in the Washington press from 1884 through their founder
    and president Perry Carson's death in 1909. They remained in existence at
    least through 1932. The club's namesake was white republican leader James G.
    Blaine, who served in Congress from 1863 to 1881, ran unsuccessfully for
    president in 1884, and was Secretary of State from 1889 to 1892. His
    portrait is mounted at the top of the badge. Several other Republican clubs
    across the country (black and white) assumed the Blaine Invincible name,
    most notably in San Francisco, but the Washington club was the only one to
    continue under that name long after its namesake's influence had passed.
    <br><br><br><br>At bottom is an uncaptioned portrait of Perry H. "Colonel"
    Carson (1842-1909), the club's leader for many years, and a major force in
    city politics. He represented the city's Republicans of all races at the
    national conventions from 1880 to 1900. Large in size as well as influence
    and personality, he was known as the "Silver-Haired Giant" or "the Tall
    Black Oak of the Potomac."

    This photograph documents the approximate moment when the bulk of Black
    voters shifted their allegiance from the Republican Party of Lincoln to the
    Democratic Party of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Republican Herbert Hoover had won
    the 1928 election with substantial Black support, but increasingly sought to
    win white southern support by making it a "lily-white" party. Mired in the
    Great Depression, he faced a tough re-election campaign in 1932, and his
    challenger Roosevelt had expressed some support for the early civil rights
    movement. In this photograph, Hoover has gathered Black supporters on the
    steps of the White House. Most notable is Roscoe Conklin Simmons, nephew of
    Booker T. Washington and long-time Republican activist (hand over heart,
    standing second from the left of Hoover). Hoover assured the crowd that "our
    party will not abandon or depart from its traditional duty toward the
    American Negro." Hoover nonetheless lost the election, due in part to
    surging Black support for Roosevelt.

    On 30 July 1866, a constitutional convention was held in New Orleans, which
    was considering establishing voting rights for the state's Black citizens. A
    mob composed mainly of ex-Confederate soldiers descended on Black marchers
    and killed approximately 50 of them. The massacre was a national scandal and
    helped establish firmer Reconstruction policies throughout the south. These
    letters were written by a young white soldier serving in the Union
    occupation. On the day of the massacre, Stagenwalt writes "There is an
    ellection in New Orleans today. There is a great ecsitement prevails
    throughout camp about the result of the ellection." He elaborates in another
    letter on 21 August: "I have just returned to Jackson Barricks from the city
    of New Orleans. . . . Our regiment was there 2 weeks on the account of the
    late riot which took place in that city. . . . The Negros wanted to vote and
    the white citizens of that place would not let them, and thus commenced the
    riot. They fought very hard. Our regiment was ordered to disperse the
    rioters, of which we done at the point of the bayonet. There was 100 Negroes

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The 1868 presidential election was the first in which the freed slaves of
    the South were able to participate. The continued Union troop presence
    through much of the south ensured a strong Black vote and resulted in
    numerous pioneering elected officials, although the Ku Klux Klan managed to
    suppress the vote in Georgia--one of the few Southern states where
    Republican war hero Ulysses S. Grant did not win a majority.
    <br><br><br><br>This photograph shows a crowd of Savannah voters lined up
    around an enormous banner for the Grant ticket. It is a well-known
    photograph, but the Library of Congress copy identifies it only as "Election
    scene." This example bears a contemporary caption reading "first colored
    vote," and places the date on Election Day, which adds to its significance.
    Many of the massed voters in the far distance do appear to be Black. At
    least one of the dozen-plus men perched on fence posts in the foreground
    appears to be white. Perhaps they were Klan "election observers," or perhaps
    they were just enjoying a sunny fall afternoon.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    In 1872, the strictly segregated University of Georgia began receiving an
    annual $8,000 in funds as a land grant university. These were federal funds
    but distributed by the state legislature. The state was still under
    Reconstruction, so the Black community had the leverage to push for a fairer
    solution. The problem fell into the lap of Joseph E. Brown (1821-1894), who
    had served as governor of Georgia throughout the Civil War and had two
    Senate terms in his future, but was then out of office; he was also a
    long-time trustee of the University of Georgia. Brown quickly determined
    that the only politically feasible way to keep the universities segregated
    was to share some of that money by "giving them a separate institution of
    their own." Here is his remarkable letter in full: <br><br><br><br>"Private
    note. Dear Col.: I see the prospect of trouble in reference to the admission
    of negroes into the college. They are determined to claim admition and if it
    is denied, they will all take position against the payment of the annual sum
    of $8,000. I am doing all I can to ward off the blow, as I am quite sure it
    is a serious matter. I see but one chance to get rid of the difficulty, and
    that is to give them a separate institution of their own, and give them an
    annual appropriation also. This will be opposed by some of our people, but
    it is that or worse, in my opinion. Among others, this is one reason why I
    cannot attend the meeting of the Board. I am giving some attention to the
    matter to keep down any bad [?] in the subject that may break up the
    college. If the present legislature should couple the appropriation with a
    condition that colored students be admitted, I see at once the trouble that
    would follow. Our southern youth will not patronize the college if they are
    admitted, and it w'd be very difficult to keep the college in a prosperous
    condition without the annual appropriation. With assurances that I shall at
    all times do all I can for the college, and with kindest regards to your
    family, I am as ever your friend."<br><br><br><br>In 1874, the Georgia
    legislature began an annual $8,000 appropriation to the all-Black Atlanta
    University to start their own land grant program, exactly as Brown had
    proposed.

    Autograph Letter Signed as "A.C.E." to mother Julia Franklin Williams of
    Belfast, TN.  2 pages, 7 x 8 inches, on one torn half sheet of paper; folds,

  at-a-glance: 'Dyer, TN, 3 [September] [1874]'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    While describing the religious revival meetings near her home in western
    Tennessee, the author writes: "The [religious] meeting at Dyer was
    absolutely broke up. Major Davidson came in, walked into the pulpit, took
    hold of the preacher's arm, said Trenton had dispatched to them for all the
    help they could get immediately. The negroes were coming in force against
    them. Everybody was on their feet instantly and great excitement prevailed.
    The country were all roused in a little time." Trenton was about 5 miles
    south of Dyer in western Tennessee. <br><br><br><br>This letter almost
    certainly relates to a mass arrest and lynching of 16 Black men in Gibson
    County, TN, as described in the long and perhaps semi-objective account in
    the Nashville Tennessean of 27 August 1874. The incident began on Saturday,
    22 August in a dispute over fifty cents between a white and Black man in
    Picketsville. Two young white men were then shot at while riding through the
    woods. Rumors spread that "the negroes were organizing armed companies" and
    that "President Grant would back the negroes in whatever course they took
    against the whites. . . . Their object in organizing thoroughly was to shoot
    KuKlux." A white posse was summoned to arrest 16 alleged ringleaders of this
    plot on 25 August, and they were placed in jail at the county seat in
    Trenton, KY. At 1 a.m. that morning, a crowd of about a hundred masked men
    rode into town, "compelled the Sheriff to surrender the keys," and took the
    16 prisoners, who were then killed in various horrible ways. The newspaper
    reported that "the wildest excitement existed throughout the country, owing
    to rumors of negroes marching in strong force for Picketsville, and rumors
    of their having murdered two white women. On the other hand, the negroes
    were terribly alarmed, and many fled to the woods, fearing the fate of those
    taken from the Trenton jail." The mob being recruited at the Dyer church
    meeting was probably not the arresting posse of 25 August or the lynch mob
    formed that evening, but rather the defense against the feared vengeful
    "negroes marching in strong force" the next day. <br><br><br><br>The author,
    Amelia Caroline (Williams) Ewell (1831-1914), was married to a well-off
    farmer in Dyer, TN, about 5 miles north of the county jail in Trenton. Her
    mother and sister Sallie lived more than a hundred miles east in Belfast,
    TN. The letter is not dated other than "Tuesday the 3rd." The envelope
    appears to be postmarked "Sept 4." 3 September 1874 fell on a Thursday, so
    the "Tuesday" or "3rd" may be in error. However, the people mentioned in
    this letter are very consistent with an 1874 date. A dentist named McLiskey
    is mentioned. James McLeskey was a dentist in Dyer born in 1842 who died
    very young in 1876. Among the family members noted, "Johnnie is preparing to
    start to Knoxville Monday to school." The author's second child John was
    born in 1856, so the early 1870s would seem plausible for him to go off to
    school on the other side of the state. "Virge" is suffering from toothaches
    and is advised to have them taken out; "she seems to be taking great
    interest in the baby." This would be eldest child Sarah Virginia, born 1853,
    who in 1874 was 21 years old, a young adult capable of making her own
    medical decisions. Her youngest sibling Roberta had been born in November
    1873. Finally, "Rufe seems to be enjoying himself finely. . . . He will take
    a start to grow if he stays long." This would be nephew Rufus F. O'Neal
    (1858-1918), son of the author's late sister Elizabeth (died 1866); he
    appears with his grandparents in the 1870 and 1880 censuses.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    William Hunlie Craighead (1877-1940) enrolled in 1901 as one of the first
    Black students at Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of
    Massachusetts at Amherst). He made the varsity football team as a freshman,
    and became the team captain in his senior year in 1905, graduating with the
    class of 1906. He is thought to be the first or second Black football
    captain at a primarily white college, according to the university.
    <br><br><br><br>This photograph shows Craighead practicing with the
    Massachusetts team, second from left on the offensive line. The scoreboard
    in the background records all of the team's victories from the 1901 season
    through December, placing the date of this image in 1902.
    <br><br><br><br>With--the scrapbook in which this photograph was found, kept
    by the family of Charles Parker Halligan (1881-1966). Halligan was a white
    Massachusetts student who played football alongside Craighead through his
    1902 graduation, then served as Craighead's coach for the 1903 season. Most
    of the album contains photographs of Halligan's family members, but several
    images are football-related. Among them is a printed team photograph clipped
    from the school's newspaper or yearbook, probably 1903, with Craighead
    identified by caption in the center.

  TYPESET: >-
    Trophy, 9 inches tall, on 4¼ x 2¾-inch base, in three parts attached by
    screws (figure of a woman reading "Triumph", base, and plaque); apparently
    missing at least one part (a golf club?), base loose, finish worn and in
    need of polishing.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    John Matthew "Jack" Shippen Jr. (1879-1968) was one of the first American
    professional golfers--and the only Black golfer to compete in the U.S. Open
    before 1948. Born in Washington, DC, he went north as a boy with his father,
    who in the 1880s became minister to the Shinnecock Indian Reservation in
    Southampton, Long Island, NY. There young Jack learned to caddy and golf.
    When the second U.S. Open was held in Shinnecock Hills in 1896, he was
    allowed to register (as an Indian), and finished 5th in the tournament. He
    also finished 5th in 1902. After that, the informal color line shut him out
    of the professional tournaments, and he made a living as a golf instructor
    in Washington. <br><br><br><br>The United States Colored Golf Association
    was founded in 1925 and persisted as the United Golfers Association until
    the integration of the Professional Golfers Association in 1961. Shippen was
    well past his prime when the USCGA was founded, but was still one of its
    best golfers. Their second tournament was held at the Mapledale Links in
    Stow, MA on 4 and 5 September 1927. At the age of 47, Shippen placed second
    in the tournament with a 313 over 4 rounds, winning the $75 second prize.
    Finishing 11th was his son John Jr. (see the Boston Globe of 6 September
    1927). <br><br><br><br>Offered here is a trophy presented to Shippen for
    this tournament two days later. The plaque reads "Presented by Betram
    Barker, U.S.C.G.A., won by Jack Shippen, Sept. 7, 1927." It is a rare relic
    of golf's pre-integration era.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The Lincoln Settlement was established in 1908 to provide services to poor
    families in Brooklyn, including a day nursery and kindergarten to support
    working mothers, plus a variety of classes and clubs for older children.
    Their building was at 105 Fleet Place between downtown Brooklyn and Fort
    Greene Park. Its founders were Verina Morton-Jones, a Black physician who
    left her practice in 1914 to provide daily leadership to the Settlement (as
    discussed here), and Mary White Ovington, a white crusader for racial
    justice, listed here as the Settlement's president. Both women were also
    among the key founders of the NAACP. The Settlement was later absorbed into
    the New York Urban League. This is the earliest publication of the Lincoln
    Settlement listed in OCLC, which traces just one copy.

    The Joe Louis Service Guild was a women's club founded in 1942 to support

    organization after the war. The great boxer's on-again, off-again wife Marva
    Louis was a founding member, though no longer active in the club by 1946;
    she is featured on page 4. This program was issued for the club's "Parade of
    Stars," which featured members and friends portraying famous film stars in
    scenes from current films: Ruth Toles as Lena Horne, Lloyd Washington as
    Charlie Chan, and dozens more. Marva Louis made a very special appearance as
    Marlene Dietrich. Much of the program is devoted to advertisements for
    Chicago's Black-owned businesses. None in OCLC.

    In August 1974, Joan Little was serving a sentence at Beaufort County Jail
    in North Carolina. A notoriously predatory prison guard attempted to rape
    her, and she stabbed him to death with an ice pick. Facing the death
    penalty, her case became a national cause at the intersection of the
    feminist, racial justice, and prison reform movements. Rosa Parks and the
    local Black Panther Party chapter were among the thousands who worked in her
    defense. In August 1975, she became (astoundingly) the first woman in
    American history to be acquitted of murder in self-defense against sexual
    assault. We trace no other example of this poster in OCLC or at auction.
