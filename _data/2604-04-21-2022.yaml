    wrote to his father, “Sculptoring I think is my medium.  I’ll never be
    satisfied until I am able to mould a mountain of stone, with the aid of a
    jack hammer, to fit my will.”  While he created approximately 12 sculptures
    during his career (of which 6 are extant), sculpture preoccupied the artist
    throughout his life. <br><br>He started studying sculpture when he took a
    clay modeling class in high school.  When he moved to New York in 1930, he
    continued his sculpture studies under Ahron Ben-Shmuel where he practiced
    direct carving.  He also studied under the modernist figural sculptor Robert
    Laurent at the Arts Students League.<br><br>He turned to sculpture during
    times of personal crisis: in 1932-33, when his father was dying, when he
    became uncomfortably famous in 1949, and when he returned to drinking
    alcohol in 1951.<br><br>The present work dates from when he was receiving
    treatment for alcoholism and a nervous breakdown at New York Hospital’s
    psychiatric hospital from June through September 1938.  It was a difficult
    time for the artist and he allegedly resisted therapy and resented being
    there.  He also created one other copper plate during this time, which is
    held by held by the Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover,
    Massachusetts.  The composition of the current work is based loosely on
    Michelangelo’s Creation of Man in the Sistine Chapel, the figure sitting
    with one fist clenched at his thigh atop an equine whose stick-like legs and
    head jut out from underneath him.  Pollock had seen photographs of the
    frescoes and sketchbooks from this time (held at the Metropolitan Museum of
    Art, New York) show Pollock’s interest in how the Italian artist rendered
    the body.  O’Connor, the co-editor of his catalogue raisonné and who held
    the present work in his collection for over 40 years, wrote of this
    sculpture, “Just as I have discovered that frontality in self-portraiture
    usually signals moments of transition when it is necessary to face up to the
    self, sculpture has a way, for the male at least, of supplying
    three-dimensional evidence of fitness—of conceiving something as tangible as
    one’s own person when the normally engendering self-image has fallen into
    eclipse.”<br><br>Pollock took a long break from sculpture in the 1940s,
    after which he became one of the most prominent Abstract Expressionist
    artists in America.  It wasn't until he and his wife, the artist Lee
    Krasner, moved to the Springs, East Hampton, Long Island, in 1945 that he
    had the space to again take up sculpting.  He started creating sculptures
    out of found objects on the beach (including natural objects such as twigs
    and sand), and many of these ephemeral sculptures are now lost.  Sculpture
    also preoccupied him in the time leading up to his death—he was working with
    the artist Tony Smith (1912-1980) on three-dimensional works in July 1956,
    another difficult time that included a creative block, alcoholism and
    depression, shortly before his fatal car accident.

    the gallerist Betty Parsons and art critic Clement Greenberg, as the leader
    of the Abstract Expressionists.  An exhibition in the same year at the Betty
    Parsons Gallery proved such: featuring his renowned "drip" paintings Autumn
    Rhythm and One, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Museum of
    Modern Art, New York, respectively.  But in 1951, Parsons exhibited
    Pollock's newest work, a series of paintings devoid of color, completed
    exclusively in black enamel on untreated canvas.  His seeming turn from
    abstract to figurative and "drip" painting to hands-on drawing baffled many
    in the art world and to some signaled his decline. Pollock reproduced
    designs for six of the black enamel paintings in screenprint to coincide
    with the exhibition. O'Connor/Thaw P 26. <br><br>With—JACKSON POLLOCK

    Jackson Pollock catalogue raisonné (published in 1978).<br><br>Seliger
    (1926-2009) was an Abstract Expressionist artist, born and raised in
    Manhattan.  He was one of the original generation of Abstract Expressionist
    artists connected with the New York School and was one of the youngest
    artists to exhibit at Peggy Guggenheim's The Art of This Century Gallery,
    New York (the forerunner to the Betty Parsons Gallery).  In 1943, Seliger
    met and befriended Jimmy Ernst the son of Max Ernst (married to Peggy
    Guggenheim at the time), and who at the age of 23 years was just a few years
    older than Seliger.  Drawn into the circle of the avant-garde in New York
    through his friendship with Ernst, Seliger's paintings attracted the
    attention of Howard Putzel who worked with Peggy Guggenheim.  At 19, Seliger
    was included in Putzel’s groundbreaking exhibition "A Problem for Critics"
    at the 67 Gallery, New York.  Also in 1945 he had his first solo show at the
    Art of This Century Gallery.  Seliger showed his paintings there until 1947
    when Guggenheim closed the gallery and returned to Europe (the
    representation of her artists was taken over by Betty Parsons).  At the age
    of only twenty Seliger's oil painting Natural History: Form within Rock,
    1946, was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, for the permanent
    collection.<br><br>Seliger was known for his small, jewel-like paintings
    (unlike most artists from the New York School who worked in large-scale
    formats).  He was a veteran of more than 45 solo exhibitions at important
    contemporary galleries and museums.  In 1950 he joined the Willard Gallery,
    New York, who represented important contemporary artists of the time
    including David Smith, Morris Graves and others.  He formed close
    friendships with many of the Willard Gallery artists, including Mark Tobey,
    Lyonel Feininger and Norman Lewis.  Seliger had his first museum exhibition,
    at the De Young Museum, San Francisco, in 1949.  In 1986, he was the subject
    of a retrospective exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York.

    (published in 1978).<br><br>Seliger (1926-2009) was an Abstract
    Expressionist artist, born and raised in Manhattan.  He was one of the
    original generation of Abstract Expressionist artists connected with the New
    York School and was one of the youngest artists to exhibit at Peggy
    Guggenheim's The Art of This Century Gallery, New York (the forerunner to
    the Betty Parsons Gallery).  In 1943, Seliger met and befriended Jimmy Ernst
    the son of Max Ernst (married to Peggy Guggenheim at the time), and who at
    the age of 23 years was just a few years older than Seliger.  Drawn into the
    circle of the avant-garde in New York through his friendship with Ernst,
    Seliger's paintings attracted the attention of Howard Putzel who worked with
    Peggy Guggenheim.  At 19, Seliger was included in Putzel’s groundbreaking
    exhibition "A Problem for Critics" at the 67 Gallery, New York.  Also in
    1945 he had his first solo show at the Art of This Century Gallery.  Seliger
    showed his paintings there until 1947 when Guggenheim closed the gallery and
    returned to Europe (the representation of her artists was taken over by
    Betty Parsons).  At the age of only twenty Seliger's oil painting Natural
    History: Form within Rock, 1946, was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art,
    New York, for the permanent collection.<br><br>Seliger was known for his
    small, jewel-like paintings (unlike most artists from the New York School
    who worked in large-scale formats).  He was a veteran of more than 45 solo
    exhibitions at important contemporary galleries and museums.  In 1950 he
    joined the Willard Gallery, New York, who represented important contemporary
    artists of the time including David Smith, Morris Graves and others.  He
    formed close friendships with many of the Willard Gallery artists, including
    Mark Tobey, Lyonel Feininger and Norman Lewis.  Seliger had his first museum
    exhibition, at the De Young Museum, San Francisco, in 1949.  In 1986, he was
    the subject of a retrospective exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim
    Museum, New York.

    Gift from the artist to Patsy Southgate, New York; private collection, New
    York; sold Christie's, New York, July 9, 2019, sale 17443, lot
    19.<br><br>Southgate (1920-1998) was a central figure in the New York School
    of Abstract Expressionist artists.  She was married to the author Peter
    Matthiessen from 1951-56, and after their divorce married the artist Michael
    Goldberg, himself a fixture in the New York School, and became a close
    friend of the poet Frank O'Hara.  Southgate, who O’Hara once called “the
    Grace Kelly of the New York School,” played an important and under-examined
    role in O’Hara’s career and imagination, appearing in many of his
    poems.<br><br>Southgate and de Kooning (1904-1997) had many artist and
    author friends in common in New York during the 1950s and soon thereafter
    became close friends themselves as neighbors in their adopted hamlet of
    Springs, on eastern Long Island (Southgate also knew Jackson Pollock and Lee
    Krasner), from the early 1960s onward.  As Southgate recalled in her eulogy
    of de Kooning, "When Bill moved out of the city and into a house right down
    the road from me, in the early sixties, Elaine stayed in New York.  I'd see
    him on his old-fashioned bicycle, a quixotic, bare-headed figure pedaling
    very slowly: a man without a car, and a good thing, too—he was generally
    headed for the liquor store.  When he painted, Bill was ferociously
    concentrated, but in real life, and even when he was drunk, he seemed shy
    and at loose ends, although he never missed a trick.  He'd come over—I'd
    have stashed my liquor in the oven—and we'd dance and listen to operas, both
    of us hoping desperately that he would stay sober," (New Yorker, March 31,
    1997, page 34).

    Hollander, "It was not until [de Kooning] returned from his trip to Japan
    that he responded to do a body of lithographs.  Perhaps the seeing and
    feeling of calligraphy, sumi brush painting and Zen inspired him
    sufficiently to do prints.  Whatever, the results were beautiful . . . We

    <br><br>Published to coincide with a monograph on de Kooning (1904-1997) and
    based on the artist's recent paintings.  According to Gagosian Gallery, New
    York, where there was a retrospective exhibition of de Kooning's late career
    paintings, "Willem de Kooning, Ten Paintings, 1983–1985," November
    8–December 21, 2013, "The paintings that de Kooning made from 1980 onwards
    are commonly said to characterize his 'late style.' In fact, it was not
    until 1983 that a far greater change occurred in his practice.  It was only
    then that he condensed the rich and tactile painterly qualities of his
    earlier work into ever-narrower bands of prismatic colors set against
    variously toned whites, connoting at once surface and space.  His
    characteristic marks of revision—scraping, visible underpainting, pigment
    feathering, glazing, and puckering—often remain, but in much more
    stripped-down, crisply graphic formats.  New is the extent to which narrow
    bands and thin, mobile lines of vivid color cause the surface to seem to
    buckle and turn in space, while shaping an elusive figuration."<br><br>The
    exhibition curator, John Elderfield, Chief Curator Emeritus of Painting and
    Sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, also remarked, "These were
    very highly regarded when they were first exhibited in the 1980s, and they
    resonate even more today.  De Kooning truly reinvented himself in these
    extraordinary canvases.  He had the confidence to give up the lush
    painterliness and visibly reworked appearance of his earlier works in favor
    of something more reductive; but they remain not only spatially complex, but
    also extremely physical pictures, both visually open and densely embodied.”

    Color screenprint on white wove paper, 1964-65.  515x614 mm; 20½x24¼ inches
    (sheet), full margins.  Intended edition of 200, though significantly fewer
    impressions have been found, indicating an unrealized edition.  Signed and
    dated "65" in ink, lower right.  Printed by Stephen Poleskie, Chiron Press,
    New York.  Published by Tanglewood Press, New York.  A superb impression
    with vibrant colors.<br><br>According to the printer Poleskie, "At that time
    we were close friends and she (de Kooning) was one of the first to work with
    me in my print shop.  I recently found some photographs of her in my studio,
    Chiron Press.   Eddie (Johnson) was also a sculptor and a filmmaker.  We
    collaborated on a movie called The Bird Film, which was widely shown back
    then at places like The Bridge Cinema in New York and the Yale Film Festival
    . . . Elaine de Kooning (1918-1989) was an associate producer, and many of
    the movie’s scenes were shot on her farm at Livingston Manor in upstate New
    York.  Eddie also took the photographs that appeared in Life magazine when
    Elaine painted her famous, or infamous, portrait of President John F.
    Kennedy.<br><br>Elaine's screenprint was done from her "bulls" series.  It
    was printed in six colors, and Elaine made all the stencils herself, with my
    help and supervision, using the tusche and glue technique.  This process is
    quite time consuming, and few of the artists I worked with back then were
    willing to put in the effort required to make a print this way.  Elaine and
    I made a lot of test prints and pulled proofs in many different color
    combinations.  Elaine was a true painter at heart . . . [she] was one of the
    few artists that actually got her hands dirty making a print."<br><br>A
    series of seven progressive proofs of this subject were sold at Swann, June
    4, 2009, sale 2182, lot 252.  One of the proofs was printed on a sheet over
    the image Seascape (I), screenprint printed in blue, 1964-65, by Roy
    Lichtenstein that was also printed at Chiron Press at the time (Corlett 36).

    (1913-2009), born in France, emigrated to the United States in 1925.  After
    working as a commerical artist, she decided to pursue painting full time. 
    She studied at the Cooper-Union School of Art, the Art Students League, and
    at the short-lived Subjects of the Artists School, under Willem de Kooning,
    Hans Hofmann, Robert Motherwell and Mark Rothko.  Thomas exhibited with the
    New York School at the legendary 1951 Ninth Street Show. In her gestural
    works, she conveyed her emotions, memories and natural spirit through the
    use of sweeping color and bold brushstrokes.  Throughout her career, she
    experimented with many styles, from action painting to geometric, solid
    planes of color.  Thomas is now widely recognized as being at the forefront
    of the Abstract Expressionism movement in New York.

    Oil on canvas, 1950s. 310x380 mm; 12¼x15¼ inches.  Signed in oil, lower
    right recto.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection, New York.<br><br>This
    work was painted in Haiti or St. Croix where Abbott (1921-2019) spent
    winters with her second husband, Tom Clyde, in the 1950s.  While on their
    honeymoon, they fell in love with the Caribbean and during their time there
    Abbott would frequent the markets, villages and wander the countryside. She
    often sketched during these outings and this work is likely a study or
    preliminary work for a larger unidentified canvas she would have finished in
    New York. Her work from this time period has a hallucinatory quality, which
    is attributed to her occasionally taking peyote while on her walks.  In her
    work she captured her emotional response to the world around her,
    rearranging elements of the natural world in abstraction.

    for I) appears twice on the plate.  Its reversal is a visual pun on the
    necessity to write backwards on the plate to have it print forwards.  The
    second time the word is doubly reversed, that is, both the letters and their
    order are backward, created an additional verbal pun, the Spanish word yo
    has become the Hebrew oy. Belknap 196.

    Private collection, London.<br><br>Possibly exhibited, "Louise Nevelson:
    First London Exhibition," Hanover Gallery, London,
    1963.<br><br><br><br>While best known for her monochromatic wooden
    assemblages, such as the current work, the Russian Empire emigré Nevelson
    (1899-1988), born in Pereiaslav near Kyiv, was also a painter and
    printmaker.  She emigrated with her family to the Untited States in 1905 and
    she began her career studying at the Art Students League in New York in
    1929, returning to Europe in 1931.  While in Europe, Nevelson visited France
    and Italy and briefly studied with Hans Hofmann in Munich. Returning to New
    York in 1932, she continued her studies with Hans Hoffman who was a visiting
    instructor at the Art Students League.  She began exhibiting her work in
    group exhibitions throughout the 1930s, but also relied on teaching classes
    for income, even being employed by the WPA to teach mural painting to a Boys
    and Girls Club in Brooklyn.<br><br>By the 1940s, Nevelson dedicated herself
    almost exclusively to sculpture; for several years the impoverished Nevelson
    and her son collected firewood to burn in order to keep warm: these served
    as the starting point for the sculptures that would make her famous.  In
    1958, Nevelson had a career turning point, when The Museum of Modern Art,
    New York, purchased one of her wooden wall sculptures and in the following
    year she was chosen to exhibit her work in The MOMA's Sixteen Americans
    exhibition.  Having achieved financial security and critical and commerical
    success, by the 1960s Nevelson was able to expand her repertoire, including
    work on monumental outdoor sculptures.  She also made a return to
    lithography and etching with which she experimented with throughout the
    1930s.<br><br>Joyce Pomeroy Schwartz, a friend of Nevelson's and a former
    assistant at Pace Gallery, New York, recalled that Nevelson, "Was the most
    organized person.  All of the garbage she picked up was totally organized. 
    It was not that she was a junk collector—she collected junk but as objects
    that were potentially art.  In her studio she had all the different sized
    wood sorted in barrels.  And when you saw this and the dishes in her closets
    you realized that this woman was a compulsive neurotic artist."

    Lithograph on Arches Cover paper, 1980. 580x995 mm; 23x39¼ inches, full
    margins. Signed, titled, dated and numbered 91/100 in pencil, lower margin.
    Printed and published by Gemini G.E.L., Los Angeles, with the blind stamps
    lower right. A very good impression of this large lithograph.<br><br>Born
    Philip Goldstein to Russian emigré parents in Montreal, Guston (1913-1980)
    attended the Los Angeles Manual Arts High School, where he became friends
    with Jackson Pollock. Guston pursued a career in the arts that led him to
    the Otis Art Institute and a lifelong friendship with the artist Reuben
    Kadish. Guston and Kadish toured Mexico in 1935, meeting Diego Rivera, and
    by 1936 had arrived in New York to work under the Federal Art Project, WPA.
    His first solo show at the Midtown Gallery in New York in 1947 was followed
    by travels to Italy.<br><br>When he returned to New York in the 1950s, he
    renewed his friendship with Pollock, as well as Adolph Gottlieb and Willem
    de Kooning, and began painting in a looser, more expressionist style.
    Guston's lithographs from the 1960s reflect the imagery of his painting and
    drawings from this time; drawn with bold, gestural strokes not unlike
    Pollock's Black Paintings from the early 1950s.<br><br>By the mid-1960s
    Guston had moved away from Abstract Expressionism toward more figural,
    representational art (called the Cartoon Paintings). Much of this later work
    is reminiscen of still lifes, landscapes and figural groups. In some cases
    there are references to the fight for racial and social justices that
    stirred during the 1960s/1970s. Despite this later departure to

    Private collection, Yorktown, New York.<br><br>Goldfarb was a contemporary
    of the New York School, attending the Art Students League in 1949 where she
    met Jackson Pollock (1912-1956).  Goldfarb did not stay in New York for long
    after her studies.  She continued to paint in the Abstract Expressionist
    style into the 1960s.  In 1954, she moved to Paris, where she forged her
    career as an abstract artist with an unshakable identity.  Goldfarb embraced
    the Parisian art scene and was welcomed into the same circles as Man Ray
    (1890-1976) and other American ex-pats.  Distance from New York perhaps led
    her to develop her unique style which blended French pointillism,
    sophisticated color theory, and her roots in abstraction.

    verso.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection, Portland, Oregon.<br><br>At
    the age of only 15, Peterdi (1915-2001) exhibited his paintings at the Ernst
    Museum in Budapest.  That same year he won the prestigious Prix de Rome for
    painting and continued his studies at the Academia delle Belle Arti before
    moving to Paris.  Settling in the United States in 1939, his first American
    solo exhibition of paintings opened later that year at the Julien Levy
    Gallery in New York.  While maintaining his activity among the Abstract
    Expressionist printmakers at Atelier 17, New York, in 1948 Peterdi began
    teaching at the Brooklyn Museum School of Art, organizing its graphic arts
    workshop.  This position gave way to a post as associate professor of art at
    Hunter College (1952-60), and his teaching career culminating with the art
    faculty at the Yale School of Art (1960-87).<br><br>Peterdi's art often
    evokes themes of nature, landscape and elemental forces.  Petrified Forest
    exhilarates and captivates with its cool colors, frequently seen in
    Peterdi's palette, and his gestural and abstracted qualities, repeatedly
    associated with the Abstract Expressionists.

  TYPESET: >-
    Oil on canvas, 1961.  405x1070 mm; 16x42¼ inches.  Signed in oil, lower
    right recto, and signed and dated in oil, verso.<br><br>Provenance: Private
    collection, Chicago.<br><br>According to the Guggenheim Museum, New York,
    whose holdings include works by the artist, "Sugaï (1919-1996) was born in
    Kobe, Japan.  He first experimented with oil painting at age nine and became
    a student at the Osaka School of Fine Arts in 1933 when he was fourteen.  He
    was part of the first generation of 20th-century Japanese artists to become
    acquainted with Western painting techniques, but he also explored both
    typography and Japanese calligraphy, important in his subsequent work. 
    Sugaï left art school prematurely to work in commercial advertising for
    Hankyu electric rail company from 1937 to 1945. During the 1940s, Sugaï
    gradually became familiar with the work of European artists such as Max
    Ernst, Paul Klee and Joan Miró, and late in that decade he discovered the
    work of Americans Alexander Calder and Jackson Pollock through art
    magazines.<br><br>He dedicated himself to painting and moved to Paris in
    1952, enrolling at the Académie de la grand chaumière.  He had his first
    solo show at Galerie Craven in 1954.  Considered part of the École de Paris
    (School of Paris) and the Nouveau Réalisme (New Realism) movements, in 1962
    he began to shift away from the abstraction in vogue on his arrival in
    Paris, moving from calligraphic, mainly monochromatic, organic motifs to
    more hard-edge geometric imagery.  Sugaï collaborated with critic
    Jean-Clarence Lambert to illustrate two books of poetry in 1957, and began
    writing short-form essays before publishing a book, La quête sans fin
    (Endless quest), in 1970.  His work of the 1960s and 1970s featured large
    capitals and reduced typographic forms. Often he would make a letter the
    sole subject of the picture, for example the well-known S series in which
    the letter became almost anthropomorphic due to Sugaï’s manipulation of
    color and placement."

  CROSSHEAD: Illa.
  TYPESET: >-
    Oil on canvas, 1962.  1270x1270 mm; 50x50 inches.  Signed in oil, lower
    right recto, and titled and dated in oil, verso.<br><br>Exhibited: "Fernando
    de Szyszlo," AMA | Art Museum of the Americas, Organization of American
    States, Washington, D.C., March 11-29, 1985.<br><br>Provenance: The estate
    of Mirtha V. Perea (1929-2019), Ambassador in the Costa Rican Foreign
    Service, Potomac, Maryland; private collection, Chicago.<br><br>According to
    the Organization of American States art program, where the Peruvian abstract
    artist Szyszlo (1925-2017) has had multiple exhibitions, "His relationship
    with the OAS art program dates back to the time of his first solo exhibition
    at the OAS art gallery in 1953.  Szyszlo subsequently worked at the OAS as a
    consultant for the Visual Art Unit in 1958, and went on hold two additional
    solo exhibitions at the OAS AMA, 1985 [where the current work was exhibited]
    and 1996.  Ten of his works--murals, mixografias, and easel paintings--have
    found homes in the OAS art collection.<br><br>Szyszlo was part of the second
    generation of Latin American artists who traveled overseas, along with
    Mexican artist Rufino Tamayo and Colombian artist Alejandro Obregon, among
    others.  His search for aesthetic identity was coupled with a
    dissatisfaction with imported modern art. As Thomas Messer [former director
    of the Guggenheim Museum, New York] explains, 'Szyzslo belonged to that
    small group of artists who first did abstract art in the South American
    continent after World War II, and he was the first abstract painter in Peru
    in a time when abstract painting was not well regarded on his side of the
    world.”  The impact of Tamayo’s work on Szyszlo charged him with an impulse
    to depict his own roots.  During the time Szyszlo spent in Peru before going
    to Paris to study painting, he began to explore and incorporate depictions
    of Chancay tapestries into his work.  There is little doubt that the artist
    represents a breaking point in Peruvian art history.  Without hyperbolizing,
    there is much evidence to suggest that his work was the single most
    significant impetus for directions taken by the following generation of
    artists looking to reenergize modern art in Peru.'"

    Meredith Long & Company, Houston, with the label verso; Spanierman Modern,
    New York, with the label verso; private collection, New
    Jersey.<br><br>Diller (1906-1965) is known as one of the first American
    artists to embrace Neoplasticism. Born in the Bronx, he spent his early
    years in Buffalo, New York and Michigan, before moving back to New York City
    in 1928. He studied at the Arts Students League, where he began his
    exploration in color and form, drawing inspiration from Constructivism and
    the De Stijl artists. While still a student, he had a solo exhibition at the
    Contemporary Arts Museum in New York and Hans Hofmann (1880-1966)  wrote the
    introduction to the catalogue. In the 1930s, Diller worked for the Public
    Works of Art Project, acting as the director of the mural division until the
    onset of World War II when he joined the navy. He was a founding member of
    the American Abstract Artists group and participated in their inaugural
    exhibition at the Squibb Gallery in 1937. Abstraction was the central tenet
    of his artistic approach throughout his career, particularly embracing the
    bold colors and geometric visual vocabulary of neoplasticism, and
    differentiated himself from his Dutch counterparts by creating his own
    themes around which he explored the picture plane.

    1924, but dropped out to become an artist. He attended the Art Students
    League in 1928-30 and had an independent study with Alexander Archipenko. He
    worked in an abstract style; however it wasn't until the late 1950s that he
    had refined it to his most recognized style—geometric compositions of flat,
    complementary colors intersected with vertical and horizontal lines. He
    co-founded "The Club" in 1949, a discussion group for artists, including
    Willem de Kooning, Conrad Marca-Relli and Ad Reinhardt. In 1951 he
    participated in the famous "Ninth Street Show", which presented The New York
    School of abstract artists to the public.

    Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, New York, with the label verso; private
    collection, New York.<br><br>Stroud (1921-2012), who was mainly self-taught
    early on, was born in England.  At age 18, he joined the British Army
    Intelligence and Signal Corps and served in World War II; he was captured in
    the Libyan desert and subsequently held as a prisoner of war for four years
    in Italian and German war camps.<br><br>Following the war, a Paul Klee
    exhibition in 1950 was instrumental in sealing Stroud's decision to become
    an artist.  He completed his artistic training at London University and the
    Central School for Art, where he received a Master of Fine Arts degree in
    1953.  Stroud joined a group of young British abstract artists, including
    Victor Passmore.  During ventures to Paris, through Peggy Guggenheim, he met
    the artist Jean Helion, whose influence was important in solidifying
    Stroud's commitment to abstraction.  Ben Nicholson was also a major
    influence during this period.<br><br>During the early 1960s, Stroud taught
    at the Maidstone College of Art, Kent, while exhibiting frequently with
    prominent galleries in London, including  his first solo show at the
    Institute for Contemporary Art in 1961 and with landmark group shows
    including "Dimensions," 1959, and "Situation," 1960, at the RBA Gallery. 
    Following his success in England, Stroud became the chairperson of the fine
    arts department at Bennington College, Vermont, and his work was included in
    the Museum of Modern Art's, New York, groundbreaking1965 exhibition, "The
    Responsive Eye."  At Bennington, Stroud was influenced by the sculptor Tony
    Smith, and exhibitions of work by Barnett Newman and Agnes Martin.  It was
    also during this time that he began his friendship with fellow artist Ad
    Reinhardt.  Following his tenure at Bennington, Stroud became Chair of the
    Art Department then Director of the Graduate Program at Rutgers University
    in New Jersey.<br><br>In 1969, Stroud was commissioned to paint murals for
    the iconic Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company building in New York, at the
    southwest corner of West 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue, the first bank
    building in the United States to be built in the International Style
    (designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and opened in 1954).

    Private collection, New Jersey.<br><br>Okoshi (1921-2008) was born in
    Seattle and at age seven returned with her family to Japan.  Her father had
    been a Japanese performer with the Barnum & Bailey circus and later as an
    entrepreneur bought the first patent rights to neon lights in Japan, to
    illuminate up the Ginza district of Tokyo.  Okoshi survived the destruction
    of World War II in Japan, but soon afterward decided to return to America. 
    She encountered obstruction by U.S. authorities refusing to recognize her as
    an American citizen by birth, but ultimately returned to Seattle, where she
    studyied art at Seattle University and the Modern Art Museum of Seattle. 
    Okoshi also found inspiration in the work of Mark Tobey, then Seattle-based
    before his return to Europe in the late 1930s, who incorporated Japanese
    sumi painting, brush gesture and calligraphy into his Abstract Expressionist
    paintings.<br><br>Okoshi made her way to New York in 1956 where she worked
    as a beautician by day and spent her nights in her studio in the West
    Village.  She studied with Jacob Lawrence at the New School Painting
    Workshop and sang in the choir at the Japanese American United Church on
    143rd Street, where she met George Mukai.  In 1976 Okoshi married Mukai who
    was also an artist.  By then she was exhibiting in shows internationally and
    was an active member of the Westbeth Artists Community in the West Village.

    and Franz Kline.  Probst's work pursued two distinct paths, one was
    figurative expressionism in which he portrayed Biblical and spiritual
    themes, albeit not subject driven, the other was purely non-objective.  The
    latter evidently had some influence on Kline, their relationship is
    repeatedly noted by Probst in his extensive private journal, discovered
    after his death, and evidenced by Kline's seminal Abstract Expressionist oil
    painting, Probst I, 1960, now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

    current owner, Athens, Greece.<br><br>After touring Europe and North Africa
    with Cy Twombly (1928-2011), Rauschenberg (1925-2008) re-emerged in New York
    in 1953 to develop his Combine works, which blended three dimensional
    everyday objects with painting in collages that explored the gap between
    elevated fine art and daily detritus.  During this time Rauschenberg met
    Jasper Johns (born 1930), who had recently returned to New York from the
    U.S. Army.  Rauschenberg, who was exhibiting and working as a maintenance
    man at Eleanor Ward's Stable Gallery helped Johns gain footing in the art
    world.  The two artists were professional and romantic partners for six
    years.  In 1954, Johns helped Rauschenberg create one of his first Combines,
    Minutuae as a prop for a Merce Cunningham performance.  It was through
    another Combine, Short Circuit, 1955, that Rauschenberg featured a
    reproduction of one of Johns' flag paintings.  In 1957, Leo Castelli met
    Johns while visiting Rauschenberg's studio and offered to exhibit the
    younger artist's works.  In 1958, with concurrent shows at Castelli and
    Cornell University, the two artists' popularity rose, however their
    important collabration and profound mutual impact on each other's works
    during these formative New York years can't be
    understated.<br><br>Rauschenberg's career blossomed during the 1960s, with
    numerous ground-breaking gallery and museum exhibitions, both in and around
    New York and internationally.  He purchased the Beach House, his first
    property on Captiva Island, in 1968.  However, the property did not become
    his permanent residence until the fall of 1970.  Rauschenberg worked from
    his home and studio on Captiva Island throughout the 1970s, focusing on both
    printmaking and related original works using natural fibers found in fabric
    and paper.  During this time he created the Hoarfrost (1974–76) and Spread
    (1975–82) series; the latter featured large stretches of collaged fabric on
    wood panels.  Rauschenberg created his Jammer (1975–76) series using
    colorful fabrics inspired by his trip to Ahmedabad, India, a city famous for
    its textiles.  International travel became a central part of Rauschenberg's
    practice after 1975 and through the 1990s and early 2000s he continued to
    evolve his artitic process and experiment with new materials such as steel
    and mirrored aluminum, transferred digital inkjet photographic images to a
    variety of painting supports, and biodegradable dyes and pigments. 
    Rauschenberg is considered both a seminal American contemporary artist,
    whose early works such as the current watercolor and collage anticipated the
    Pop art movement, and a prolific creator, whose unparalleled, experimental
    creative streak spanned more than half a century.

    Foundation, New York, and is archived on the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation
    website.<br><br>Roy Pearce (1919-2012) was a professor of literature and one
    of the founders of the University of California, San Diego, Literature
    Department in 1963.  Prior to moving to California, Pearce taught at Ohio
    State University, where he met and befriended Lichtenstein (1923-1997), who
    earned his bachelor's degree there in 1946 and a Master's in Fine Arts
    degree in 1949 (Lichtenstein also taught as an instructor in the fine arts
    dpeartment at Ohio State, a post he held intermitently during the 1950s). 
    In 1951, Lichtenstein and his first wife, Isabel Wilson, moved to Cleveland
    and he also had his first solo exhibition at the Carlebach Gallery, New
    York.<br><br>During his time in Cleveland, Lichtenstein pursued Native
    American-themed subjects in his paintings, drawings and prints.  He was
    inspired by a book he had borrowed from Pearce on the art of the 19th
    century American painter George Caitlin (1796-1872), who specialized in
    Native American scenes and portraits.  According to a New York Times
    interview in 2005, Lichtenstein referred to his 1950s paintings as, "Taking
    the kind of stodgy pictures you see in history textbooks and redoing them in
    a modern-art way."  These early paintings, appropriated from 19th century
    models, anticipate Lichtenstein's comic strip-inspired subjects from the
    early 1960s onward, and which are seen as pioneering works in the American
    Pop Art canon.

    his Cathedral and Haystacks series.  Additionally, Frederic Tuten, writer

    Oil on canvas, circa 1957.  150x201 mm; 6x8 inches.<br><br>Provenance: Gift
    from the artist directly to current owner, private collection,
    Maine.<br><br>Indiana (1928-2018), born Robert Clark in New Castle, Indiana,
    was recognized for his artistic talent during childhood and was enrolled in
    the art curriculum at Arsenal Technical High School in 1942.  After
    graduating, Indiana enlisted in the Air Force and studied at the Art
    Institute of Chicago, the Skowhegan School of Sculpture and Painting in
    Maine during the summer of 1953, and the Edinburgh College of Art.  Indiana
    returned from Scotland in 1954 and settled in New York.  In 1956, fellow
    artist Ellsworth Kelly (1923-2015) persuaded Indiana to take up residence at
    Coenties Slip on the East River, a paved over inlet inhabited by a community
    of artists who made use of its abandoned warehouses and lofts. Lacking most
    modern amenities, the artists formed a tight-knit group who had to
    collaborate and share in order to survive.<br><br>Indiana, who had lived
    there until moving to the Bowery in 1964, was deeply influenced by life in
    Coenties Slip; the new inhabitants found vestiges of ships among the
    buildings, and Indiana began to create assemblages with these remnants.  The
    young artist supplemented these sculptures with stenciled numbers and
    letters, the iconic style for which he would become heralded as a progenitor
    of the Pop Art movement.   One of Indiana's most well-known works, the
    1961-62 oil on canvas The Melville Triptych drew directly from Herman
    Melville's mention of Coenties and Indiana's home.  Though Indiana was
    featured in several landmark exhibitions in New York during his early
    career, it was not until Alfred Barr acquired the artist's 1960-61 oil on
    canvas The American Dream, I for the Museum of Modern Art, New York that
    Indiana became one of the most prominent artists of his
    generation.<br><br>We have found fewer than ten other works by Indiana, that
    he created before 1960, at auction in he past 30 years; many of these early
    career paintings, sculptures and objects are now in public and private
    collections.

    progressive trial proofs at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago,
    where he learned printmaking from 1949 to 1952, under the supervision of
    Vera Berdich (inscribed "CHI").  Additionally 13 trial proofs were printed
    at the Pratt Graphic Art Center, New York (these inscribed "NYC").  The
    regular edition was printed by Atelier Georges Lablanc, Paris and published
    by Galleria Schwarz, Milan to be included in International Anthology of

    <br><br>Provenance: Private collection, New York.<br><br>During his
    attendance at the School of Visual Arts, New York, Haring (1958-1990)
    studied semiotics, the usage and interpretation of signs and symbols.  In
    1980, the artist started to create chalk drawings on the unused advertising
    panels of the New York Subway stations, and would continue doing so for the
    next forty years to the delight of the city's commuters.  Barking dogs were
    among his repeated icons, along with flying saucers and his signature
    radiant baby.  Haring's pictographs, for their simplicity and accessibility,
    were replicated on T-shirts as well as a multitude of other consumer goods,
    securing Haring's place in 1980s popular culture.

    second, smaller version of the subject, from 1975, appeared in the Untitled
    Portfolio, which was also printed and published by Cirrus
    Editions.<br><br>As Bruce Davis notes in his introduction to the Cirrus
    Editions catalogue raisonné, "Celmins's landscapes are among the most
    singular produced during this period and have earned an international
    reputation for their intensely focused views of nature.  In the late 1960s
    Celmins turned from making paintings and sculptures (with their subjects of
    common household objects and airplanes) to drawing, specifically renditions
    in graphite of ocean surfaces, desert floors and skies.  Given her interest
    in draftsmanship, not surprisingly shortly thereafter she made her initial
    foray in 1970 into lithography at Tamarind, with a closeup view of the ocean
    surface.  The following year she made her second print, Untitled (Desert),
    at Cirrus; in 1972 came Untitled (Ocean) and in 1975 Untitled Portfolio:
    Ocean, Desert, Sky, Galaxy.  These lithographs are notable for their
    striking contrasts between their apparent naturalism and their distinctive
    compositional point of view, made especially intense and surreal by the
    elimination of horizon lines.  Without any suggestion of fore-, middle- and
    background, the images become surface patterns compressed without space onto
    the picture plane, and the viewer's gaze is directed quite forcefully into
    examination of the subjects," (Davis, Made in LA, The Prints of Cirrus
    Editions, Los Angeles, 1995, page 23).  Davis page 205.

    Jersey.<br><br>Amar (1954-2001) was born in Casablanca, Morocco in 1954 to a
    Sephardic Jewish father and a Spanish mother before immigrating to Toronto,
    Canada in 1957. Although his family could not afford much, Amar was
    surrounded by the arts in his childhood. In 1974, he received the Dorothy
    Reid Scholarship to attend Ontario College of Art but later quit after only
    a few years to commit himself to his own studio and practice. After several
    successful gallery exhibitions in Toronto, Amar and his wife moved to
    Brooklyn, New York in 1979, although he would periodically return to Toronto
    to teach classes at the Ontario College of Art. In New York, he became
    exposed to New York-based artists such as Willem de Kooning, Barnett Newman,
    Jackson Pollack and Mark Rothko. His works from the 1970s onward combine
    Abstract Expressionism with a unique dialogue with Minimalism, a style
    dominating the art world in the 1960s and 1970s. Robert Rauschenberg's
    "combine paintings" and Cy Twombly's gestural scribbled works were also of
    particular interest and influence on Amar.

    (1912-1999) was a Ukrainian-American magazine editor, publisher, painter,
    photographer and sculptor.  He was born into a Jewish family in Kyiv, and
    when his father took a post advising the Soviet government, the family moved
    to Moscow.  Following difficulties in Moscow, his father secured permission
    from Lenin and the Politburo to take his son to London in 1921.  Liberman
    started work in the publishing industry in Paris during the 1930s.  After
    emigrating to New York in 1941, he began working for Condé Nast
    Publications, rising to the position of editorial director, which he held
    from 1962 to 1994.<br><br>Only in the 1950s did Liberman take up painting
    and, later, metal sculpture.  His highly recognizable sculptures are
    assembled from industrial objects, often painted in uniform bright colors or
    highly polished like the current work.  His monumental sculpture The
    Way,1972-80, made of eighteen salvaged steel oil tanks, is a signature work
    of Laumeier Sculpture Park, and a major landmark of St. Louis, Missouri.

    frame back.<br><br>Wilson (1924-2015) is known for her expressionist
    landscapes that often depict expansive skies in harmonic colors.  She was
    born in Iowa, and her childhood living on a farm greatly influenced her
    interest in natural elements, especially the expanse of the sky as it
    related to the flat plains of the farm where she grew up.  She has said, "I
    used to roam around a lot by myself as a child, and when I think of a
    landscape, I think of the great weight of the sky and how it rests on the
    earth."  She studied painting and art history at the University of Iowa
    before moving to New York and becoming involved with the New York school of
    artists, exhibiting at Tanager Gallery and Stable Gallery as well as
    co-founding the Hansa Gallery, an artists' cooperative, before joining the
    Tibor de Nagy gallery.  During her long career, she continued to depict the
    luminous aspects of the sky, sea and land.  Her work is included in the
    permanent collections of The Museum of Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum
    of Art , and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among others.

    suburban Long Island.  He was enrolled at the University of North Texas for
    a short time, but left before completing his degree.  Longo next studied on
    a grant at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence, Italy before receiving
    his BFA from Buffalo State College in 1975.  Shortly after, he moved to New
    York and became immersed in the downtown art scene.  Longo remained largely
    under the radar until his seminal Men in the Cities series beginning in the
    early 1980s, featuring large charcoal drawings of contorted men and women
    clad in business suits and lithographs based on these drawings, such as the
    current work.<br><br>Longo has created in a diverse array of media over the
    course of his venerable career.  While his method was multidisciplinary
    throughout the 80s, often combining elements of drawing, sculpture, cinema
    and performance art, Longo's oeuvre consists mainly of monumental charcoal
    drawings done in a hyperrealist style. This medium allows him to create the
    strong lines and rich chiaroscuro that help bring his drawings to life.  His
    subject matter is varied, ranging from nature to seemingly banal objects to
    political imagery.
