  TYPESET: >-
    Throughout his career, Berthon designed more decorative panels than posters.
    He would draw them onto the lithographic stones himself in order to ensure
    the most sophisticated, pastel effects. <i>Les Eglantines</i> is one image
    in a series devoted to flowers that was printed by Chaix. As with all of
    Berthon's work, it is a warm-toned pastel image, with a delicate Symbolist
    atmosphere. A theme of sensuousness runs through many of his works and is
    exhibited here in the way the woman is holding the branch. Arwas p. 106,

    Bonnard designed only six posters. His first, <i>France Champagne</i> in
    1891, was a revolutionary image, displaying the influence of the Ukiyo-e
    Japanese prints and opening up horizons for the new generation of poster
    artists. "The central element of this highly modern composition, in which
    the large area of blank paper creates a vacuum, is the woman who is depicted
    only in outline - with details provided only at the top of her dress and the
    rendering of her head . . . The monogram, in the form of a butterfly, pays
    tribute to Japanese art and balances the composition" (Salon des Cent p.
    35). Her attention (and that of the viewer) is drawn to the charming little
    dog. Wember 137, DFP-II 79, Salon des Cent 5, Bouvet 39, Art Nouveau p. 85,

  TYPESET: >-
    In 1903, Bonnard designed two posters for <i>Le Figaro</i>. This, the
    smaller of the two, has the appearance of a stock poster. Using only two
    colors, Bonnard has created a frame upon which rests an exquisite drawing of
    a couple sitting down to read the newspaper. Since the typography does not
    appear to be designed by Bonnard, it would follow that the poster was meant
    to be reused for different issues of the newspaper, carrying different
    stories. However, as copies of the poster with different text have not
    appeared, it likely was not used in this manner. The other poster Bonnard
    designed in the same year was much larger and was intended to advertise the
    availability of the paper in general, not a specific story. Fit to Print 19,

  TYPESET: >-
    Bouisset's poster of a young girl (his daughter Yvonne) writing on a wall to
    advertise Chocolat Menier launched him to instant fame within the poster
    world. Becoming a specialist in using children in his posters, it wasn't
    long before he called on his son Jacques to pose for various images. Young
    Jacques appears in many seminal poster images, including LU (Biscuits
    Lefevre Utile), Poulain and this rather surprising image for rolling papers.
    While child labor was certainly a part of French society at the end of the
    19th century, it wasn't often paraded in front of the public. So why enlist
    this young chimney sweep into advertising? For a possible answer we turn to
    the advertising genius of the parent company, Job, and its owner Jean
    Bardou. They had already employed the ultimate talents in the poster world
    to design their advertising (Jules Chéret, Alphonse Mucha, Pal and others)
    and Bardou realized that Bouisset's style had become a popular trend. He was
    obviously correct, as this charming poster was very successful.

    Géraudel was an inventive chemist who made a fortune selling pastilles
    (cough drops) and this cure-all purgative. The key to his success was his
    sense of advertising. He took advantage of the new medium of posters and
    regularly availed himself of the medium's earliest acclaimed master; Chéret
    excelled at this elongated format that allowed him to create
    larger-than-life "Chérettes." Later that year, Chéret reconfigured the
    poster for a smaller, one-sheet version. Broido 894, DFP-II 221, Cheret

  TYPESET: >-
    The Eiffel Tower was constructed as part of the 1889 Paris World's Fair.
    During the fair there was a restaurant, Flamand, on the first level. The
    tower was supposed to be torn down once the fair ended; fortuitously that
    decision was never executed, and only the restaurant was closed. In its
    place Charles Bodinière and the writer Alphonse Frank opened up a 400-seat
    theater. The theater ran from May to October every year, and eventually
    closed in 1900. On May 16th, 1893, the Théatre de la Tour Eiffel made an
    attempt to bring some of Montmartre's spirit to the bourgeois Right Bank,
    with the opening of Paris / Chicago. The show, written by Frank and Gaston
    Arman de Caillavet was a tremendous success. Using a bold diagonal to create
    a descending movement, Chéret depicts his main characters in detail, and
    other characters in the background less so. The entire image is given a
    joyful, weightless feeling, as all of the characters (and even some of the
    typography) appear to be floating through the air. When it was printed, this
    poster was extremely popular with collectors, and it was offered to the
    market in three variations: with only the black outline, before the
    lettering, or like this, in its final iteration. Cheret 343, Broido 273,

  TYPESET: >-
    Dudovich was one of the most prolific and important of the Italian poster
    artists. He designed more than six hundred posters in a career that spanned
    more than half a century. His formative years were spent working under
    Adolfo Hohenstein and Leopoldo Metlicovitz at the G. Ricordi printing
    company in Milan, where he worked exclusively up until the First World War
    (for a few years, between 1899-1906, he left to work with a different
    printer Chappuis, in Bologne). After the war ended, Dudovich became the art
    director at IGAP, another large printer in Milan. Throughout his career, he
    worked for all of the major Italian companies, but he is best remembered for
    the images he designed for the Italian department stores Mele and À La
    Rinascente. This poster for a liqueur marks Dudovich's triumphant return to
    Ricordi after his six-year stint at Chappuis. It is not only one of his
    masterpieces, but a masterpiece of Italian poster art itself. Using light in
    a staggeringly effective manner against flat tones and half-tones, he
    depicts a voluptuous woman leaning over to smell the aroma emanating from a
    small glass of liqueur. The manner in which the light diffusing from the
    glass spreads all over the table and onto her body, is handled in an
    exceptionally sensual manner. Her generous décolletage helps turn this
    simplest of gestures into an unforgettable, monumental act. Weill 146,

    In the 1890s Grün was living in Montmartre and had become an integral part
    of the artistic scene there. In 1897, an aggressive entrepreneur "attempted
    an outright takeover of the highly flourishing, but limited world of small
    cabaret owners. At great expense, he built a spacious theatre in the garden
    next to the Elysée Montmartre and hired away the best cabaret singers [from
    the area's other smaller venues]" (Grun p. 29). Grün was commissioned to
    design a poster for the Trianon's opening that showed a gallery of all the
    big names and stars who would be performing there. Grün also inserted his
    own portrait, at the far right. The poster is a rare document, perhaps the
    only one on which all of the major stars of the Montmartre cabarets, at the
    height of their popularity, appear en masse. Grun p. 29, DFP-II 448,

    La Cigale opened in the heart of Montmartre in 1887, and became even more
    successful after it was expanded in 1894, making it one of the largest of
    the Parisian music halls. It also made use of the best poster designers to
    promote its shows, and Grün was employed exclusively between 1898 and 1902.
    As the scope of this show was larger than the usual cabarets for which Grün
    worked, the artist had to adapt his style. Rather than focusing on one
    voluptuous, sexy character, Grün depicts the entire cast of this large
    production, prominently featuring Jeanne Bloch in the center. The poster
    also employs more colors than Grün's usual combination of red and black.

    Ibels was one of the most prominent young artists in Paris in the 1890s. He
    studied at the <i>Academie Julian</i> with Pierre Bonnard and Edouard
    Vuillard and became one of the founding members of the <i>Nabis</i>,
    participating in all of their exhibitions. In 1891, his works were exhibited
    side-by-side with Toulouse-Lautrec's at the <i>Salon des Independants</i>,
    and the two became close friends. Like Toulouse-Lautrec, he loved the
    café-concerts and designed most of his posters for, or featuring performers.
    In 1893, he collaborated with Toulouse-Lautrec on an album of lithographs
    entitled <i>Le Café-Concert</i>. Rather than become a painter, Ibels
    dedicated his art to the printed page, working for magazines, designing
    sheet music covers and theatrical programs. Within the <i>Nabis</i>, he was
    known as "The Nabis Journalist," because of his work for many of Paris'
    progressive journals and the founding of the short-lived periodical
    <i>L'Escarmouche</i>. DFP-II 471, Wine Spectator 56, Reims 745, Schardt p.

    <i>La Plume</i> had recognized and lauded Ibels' talent in their January 15,
    1893 issue. A year later they bestowed a further honor on him by
    commissioning him to design the poster for the first <i>Salon des Cent</i>.
    For his poster he employed a palette of five colors, softly gradated between
    green and brown. The image is composed of many of his favorite characters: a
    ballet dancer, a harlequin and a Pierrot who is actually painting a picture
    of the ballerina. As with all of Ibels' work, it is a high-standard drawing
    of intense poetical elegance. "Remarkable in more than one way, this poster
    presents a resolutely modern composition and a framing which reveal the
    position of the ballerina in a depthless, indefinite space, as well as the
    perfect integration of the text to the image" (Salon des Cent p. 55). DFP-II

    <i>The Critic's Getting Up</i> was a satirical play performed at the Theatre
    d'Application. The image is of a young woman whispering into the ear of a
    statue. For the Parisian avant-garde in Paris at the time, the statue's face
    would have been immediately recognizable: it is a caricature of the critic
    Francisque Sarcey, whom everybody loved to tease and who was an easy target
    for criticism himself. With features that were prone to caricature, and as
    an unofficial whipping boy of the avant-garde, Sarcey was also depicted in
    several posters by Jules-Alexandre Grün. Most likely, Sarcey was also a
    target in this play. DFP-I 477 (var), Reims 751, Hillier p. 78.

    Primarily a painter, whose work was influenced by Burke-Jones and the
    pre-Raphaelites, de Karolis is barely known as a poster artist. Here, in his
    poster promoting Turin's 1911 <i>International Exhibition of Industry and
    Trade</i>, he uses a nearly identical image to that employed by Metlicovitz
    for the same event (see Swann sale 2133, lot 100). The only difference
    between the posters is that Metlicovitz's allegory was of only two men,
    while de Karolis depicts three. Bolaffi p. 73.

    constantly change his style from tender Art Nouveau imagery to statuesque
    allegory. For this image he has adapted yet another style, illustrating a
    peasant woman in flat colors, hard at work cleaning her whites using

  TYPESET: >-
    Cassan was once the largest and most important lithographer in Southwest
    France. This poster, Mucha's elaborate and exquisite self-advertisement for
    the printer, features a seamless blend of printing imagery with fantasy.
    "The muscular printer is an allegorical figure, representing the [printing]
    industry. An unusual border of eyes in the mosaic background probably is
    meant to indicate the multitude of readers whom the printing trade serves.
    It is also one of the mystic symbols used by Mucha in several other works"
    (Rennert / Weill p. 70). The young lady is herself representative of the
    public that patronizes printers. In a brilliant self-referential detail,
    this woman, marked by her beauty, a state of semi-undress and stylized
    cascading hair, is pulling prints straight off the press that feature other
    young women with equally flowing locks - as if Mucha were indicating how his
    archetypical treatment of female tresses was about to take over the
    industry. This is the large format. Rennert / Weill 11, Lendl p. 109, Mucha

  TYPESET: >-
    The production of <i>Medee</i> advertised here was a contemporary adaptation
    of a play originally written by Euripides. A classic, violent Greek tragedy
    about the warrior Jason, the play begins when he returns home from his quest
    for the Golden Fleece, bringing with him Medea. When he falls in love with
    another woman, Medea, "driven by a pagan code of honor and her own dark
    passions . . . conceives a terrible vengeance of gothic cruelty: she kills
    Jason's father, her own two children, and his new mistress, so that he would
    have to go through life deprived of everything he loved" (Rennert / Weill p.
    208). The somber and tragic image depicts a glimpse of the slaughter, with
    Medea, a mad look in her eyes, standing with a bloody dagger over one of her
    victims. "Mucha's exquisite design uses Medea's arm and the dagger as a
    giant exclamation point, emphasized by the look of stark horror on her face
    as she exacts her gothic revenge. It is one of [Mucha's] most powerful
    posters" (Lendl p. 53). "It carries all the signs of Mucha's masterpieces in
    composition and color as well as the decorative certainty with which he left
    the bottom two-thirds of the background white" (Spirit of Art Nouveau p.
    151). The composition is organized vertically with Mucha's trademark "halo"
    behind the actress' head, and lettering designed in the style of mosaic to
    evoke the story's origin in ancient Greece. Sarah Bernhardt was so enamored
    with the snake bracelet that Mucha depicted adorning her arm that she
    actually had one made by Fouquet for her to wear. Rennert / Weill 53, DFP-II

  TYPESET: >-
    Mucha's irresistible allegories of flowers are among the most delicate of
    the decorative panels Mucha designed. His printer, Champenois, continuously
    pushed him to design more panels to satisfy the public's seemingly
    insatiable demand. In all, Mucha designed approximately 18 different sets of
    decorative panels. These are in many ways his most sensual images, playing a
    flirtatious graphic game between the women and the flowers that surround
    them. Mucha's paintings of both <i>Iris</i> and <i>Carnation</i> were
    exhibited in his one-man show at the <i>Salon des Cent</i> in 1897. The
    aquarelles bore the notice "to be published by Champenois." Over the course
    of the next few months, Mucha completed the other two flowers. The set in
    this format, printed in a run of 1000, sold out so quickly that Champenois
    printed the series again in a smaller format with all four images on a
    single sheet. "One of the fundamental premises of art nouveau was to look
    for inspiration in nature, and in <i>The Flowers</i> set Mucha produced one
    of the best arguments for it . . . it is a clear case of Beauty celebrating
    beauty in each instance. By using soft pastels and harmonious composition,
    Mucha imbued each scene with a sense of tranquility and quiet enjoyment"

    Sarah Bernhardt made her first American tour in 1896, by which point she was
    already an international star, taking with her a variation of one of the
    posters Mucha had designed for her in Paris. "As was the case with all these
    versions, it mentioned no name of the play, nor did it mention that the
    plays for which the design was originally used were presented on this tour"
    (Rennert / Weill p. 108). Among Mucha's famous posters for the actress that
    were reused to promote her American appearances were <i>Gismonda,
    Lorenzaccio, Tosca</i> and this, <i>La Dame aux Camelias</i>. This tour,
    beginning in 1914, was in many ways the actress' final act; she was already
    in her late 60s, World War I had broken out, and in 1916 she had her leg
    amputated below the knee. With these factors combined with a lack of
    contemporary media coverage, it is uncertain how much, if any, of this tour
    actually took place, possibly accounting for the scarcity of the image. Note
    how it is referred to as a "World's Tour" and not an American Tour. Aside
    from the entirely different titles and text, the most obvious diversion from
    Mucha's original is the bright colors used here, compared with the subtle
    pastels from 1896. <i>Rare</i>.

    Adapted from Mucha's 1898 design for the cover of <i>L'Estampe Moderne</i>,
    Sarah Bernhardt also used a smaller and less colorful version of this image
    to promote her first of three American tours starting in 1905 (see Swann
    Sale 2421 Lot 43). The absence of Mucha's signature suggests that the image
    was merely inspired by Mucha, but not created by his hand. The visual link
    here to psychedelic posters from the 1960s is as palpable as any we have
    ever seen; one can even see Milton Glaser's inspiration for his Bob Dylan
    poster in the way this unknown artist depicts the outlined flowers behind
    this maiden's ear. <i>Rare</i>.

  TYPESET: >-
    This, "one of Mucha's most moving posters . . . was a plea for help for
    starving Russian children during the war between the Bolsheviks and the
    White Russians. Between 1918 and 1922, the economic situation in Russia
    became desperate, and western countries including the United States sent
    shipments of food and grain. The Russian government had to allow partial
    restoration of previously nationalized private land so that the land could
    be more efficiently cultivated. The title of the poster consists of only two
    words in Latin ['Restore Russia'], which can be understood by the speakers
    of many languages. It means Russia must be restored to conditions suitable
    for human life. Mucha elevated the sorrowful woman holding an exhausted
    child beyond the meaning of Mother Russia with her gaunt ward by placing
    circular forms behind their heads, invoking the halos of the Madonna with
    the Christ child. Two wounded doves in the upper corners signify a Slavic
    nation that would die without aid, and the hearts in the lower corners
    express hope in human compassion" (Spirit of Art Nouveau p. 181). Lendl p.

  TYPESET: >-
    <i>L'Estampe Moderne</i> was published between May 1897 and April 1899. As
    with <i>Les Maitres de l'Affiche</i>, every month, four prints were issued
    to subscribers, delivered in a portfolio sleeve designed by Mucha. In all,
    there were 100 images. However, as the name implies, these were not posters
    but prints, designed by many of the popular artists of the day. The
    technical and editorial team responsible for publishing the works was among
    the best of its day: the printer was Champenois, and the directors were
    Charles Piazza (who published Mucha's <i>Ilsée</i> and <i>Le Pater</i>), and
    Charles Masson, the director of the Musée du Luxembourg. The print run was
    limited to 2000 copies, with an additional 100 printed on Japan paper.
    Although all of the prints were designed especially for this portfolio,
    different printing techniques were used, as some are lithographs and some
    are collotypes. Charpentier, whose monogram appears on the cover of this
    portfolio, was a lesser-known but prolific Art Nouveau artist. He was a
    founding member of "L'Art dans Tout," and was adept at woodworking,
    medal-design, terracotta, and furniture design. One of his lithographic
    designs is featured as a plate in <i>Les Maitres de L'Affiche</i>, and he
    was the creator of the blind stamp on each plate of the 1893-5 <i>L'Estampe
    Originale</i> portfolio (Lugt 819).

    outlining and a great sense of caricature. He only designed a few posters,
    which is unfortunate, as his style lends itself marvelously to their large
    format. As a prominent member of the <i>Salon des Humoristes</i> it is not
    surprising that Roubille was ultimately asked to design a poster for one of
    their exhibitions. In a Cappiello-like image, Roubille depicts a joyful
    woman, literally "grabbing the bull by the horns" (or at least the
    pen-holding polar bear by the teeth!). This is the version before lettering.

    <i>Lait Pur Stérilisé</i> is the first poster Charles Verneau printed for
    Steinlen. It was only the second poster in Steinlen's "mature style" (Arwas,
    p. 54). The artist and the printer formed a lasting relationship and went on
    to produce some of the era's most memorable posters. This poster instantly
    became a success and remains an iconic image of the period. It is almost
    deceptively simple, featuring the artist's daughter, Colette, sitting at a
    table sipping from a bowl of milk, with three cats at her feet hoping for a
    single spilled drop. It is a delicate image, beautifully drawn on stone with
    a "flowing curvilinearity" (Cates & Gill p. 122). Steinlen used green for
    the outline, as opposed to black, which adds to the soft feel of the image.

    <i>Cocorico</i> was a magazine published between 1898 and 1902. As a

    Nouveau movement and its primary artists included Mucha, Steinlen, de Feure,
    Villon and many others. In all, there were 63 issues. The name of the
    periodical is the French onomatopoeia for "cock-a-doodle-doo," the crowing
    of a rooster. In this instance, Steinlen employs the title as an exceptional
    wake-up call for the world to notice this little magazine and the big ideas
    contained within. This is the larger format, with text. Bargiel & Zagrodzki

    With this heartfelt and tender image of a family evicted onto the street to
    advertise the advent of a tenants' association, "Steinlen's posters began
    promoting social causes rather than commercial products" (Cate and Gill p.
    51). A transition between his advertising work and later war images, we can
    still see several familiar themes, such as the cat and the children, which
    make this image "among his most appealing works . . . Steinlen at his
    humanistic best" (Wine Spectator). Whereas Steinlen's images from 1917-18
    are almost all black and white, here we still experience some of his vibrant
    colors. Bargiel 52, Wine Spectator 113.

    The Divan Japonais was a small café-concert at 75 Rue des Martyrs, where
    Yvette Guilbert performed after becoming popular through her act at the
    Moulin Rouge. This is Toulouse-Lautrec's only poster to show both Jane Avril
    and Yvette Guilbert, the two Montmartre demimondes who were both his friends
    and major inspirations. Jane Avril, the star dancer at the Moulin Rouge, is
    pictured here seated next to the literary critic, Édouard Dujardin. Onstage
    in the background, Guilbert is depicted from the neck down, recognizable by
    her trademark long black gloves. The composition is built along the diagonal
    of the stage and the orchestra in the style of Japanese woodblock prints
    that were so fashionable in Paris at the end of the 19th century. Lautrec
    impishly punctures the diagonal with the priapic scrolls of the instruments.

  TYPESET: >-
    In many ways, both Lautrec and Bruant owed their success in part to each
    other. In 1892, Lautrec designed Ambassadeurs, one of the most enduring
    images of the performer, which captures his famed arrogance. The cabaret
    star loved the image, and Bruant in turn became one of Lautrec's best
    clients, commissioning three additional posters from him. This poster shows
    the combined insolence of Bruant and Lautrec. The performer, dressed in his
    trademark black velvet suit, hat and boots, doesn't even deign to face the
    public and his viewers. Through Lautrec's genius, the performer still
    remains immediately recognizable. "This poster was printed with three
    different texts, and also used on the cover of Le <i>Mirliton</i> . . .
    [this variation advertises] Bruant's second volume of songs and monologues .
    . . Interestingly Bruant chose Steinlen to illustrate both books but still
    turned to Lautrec for the poster to advertise it, astutely sensing the
    difference between Steinlen's more narrative, illustrative style and
    Lautrec's bold graphic language" (Montmartre p. 93). This is a variant of
    the Fourth State, with the addition of red tint in cuffs and collar. This
    state includes the olive green lettering, not designed by Lautrec. Adriani

  TYPESET: >-
    The design and printing of the poster for Babylone d'Allemagne was partly an
    inside joke and partly an international scandal. The poster advertises a
    book written by Lautrec's friend Victor Joze. The two had worked together
    before, in 1892, when Lautrec designed a poster for <i>La Reine de Joie</i>,
    another book by Joze that resulted in a huge scandal. Two years later Joze
    again approached Lautrec to help promote his latest work, <i>The German
    Babylon</i>, exposing the decadence of the Berlin aristocracy. The poster,
    one of Lautrec's most elaborate designs, is composed of two opposing
    diagonals. The first is the line formed by the ascending cavalry parade,
    with a handsome young officer astride his mount. The second diagonal is
    formed between the hirsute sentinel and a passing bourgeois couple, the
    woman casting her glance at the blond rider. The white haunches of the horse
    (the uninked paper itself) are outlined in Lautrec's favored olive green,
    attracting the viewer's eye. He also uses the green in <i>crachis</i>
    (splatter), in the background. When Joze saw the finished poster, with the
    prominently displayed horse's rump and the unattractive German guard
    (allegedly a caricature of the Kaiser), he felt that it was too dangerous to
    post all over town, and that there might be a political backlash against it.
    Lautrec had obviously anticipated his friend's concern, and to thwart any
    plans to squelch the image, had paid for the printing and distribution of
    the poster himself. This is the version with text. Adriani p. 96, Delteil

    Marcelle Lender (1862-1926) starred in many of the operettas and comic
    operas popular at the end of the 19th century. One of her shows,
    <i>Chilperic</i>, was justifiably unmemorable except that it inspired
    Lautrec to paint a magnificent painting and design six lithographs (Adriani
    110-115). This is by far the best image from that series and the only one
    that is in color. Lautrec depicts her bowing after an extravagant Spanish
    dance that fascinated him. To render her wild attire and hairdo, he used
    eight colors with chalk, ink with brush and a spraying/splatter technique.
    As Adriani notes, "no other lithograph is printed with such wealth of subtle
    color combinations and none embodies, as this does, the opulent decoration
    of an age moving towards its close." This is the fourth state of four, from
    the edition of 1211 impressions printed for the Berlin magazine <i>Pan</i>,
    which were inserted in volume I, no. 3 of the periodical. Delteil 102 III,

    Misia Natanson, the wife of one of the founders of the <i>Revue Blanche</i>,
    was the muse for the artists and writers within this circle. Renowned as a
    brilliant, charming and beautiful woman, she was a source of inspiration for
    Pierre Bonnard, Jacques Villon and Felix Vallotton, among others. Both
    Bonnard and Toulouse-Lautrec were asked to design a poster promoting the
    magazine and they both chose Misia, the living incarnation of the spirit of
    the <i>Revue Blanche</i>, as their subject. Lautrec's image is
    uncharacteristically soft and endearing, representing Misia skating. Some
    people have suggested that Lautrec had fallen in love with her, which would
    explain this rare, tender portrait. The fact that he depicts her without
    showing her legs lends the image a strange, unbalanced feeling, and adds to
    the mystery of the poster. Adriani 130, Delteil 355, Reims 788, Maitres pl.

    Lautrec's series <i>Elles</i> is one of the high-points of

    sexuality, but instead focused on the banal routines of their daily lives.
    100 of these portfolios were printed. The cover and frontispiece of the
    folio bore this illustration, and when the 10 sheets were put on exhibition
    in the offices of <i>La Plume</i> magazine in 1896, this image, with the
    addition of the text (not by Lautrec's design), was re-used as a poster.

    Bradley's style is sometimes referred to as American Art Nouveau, a
    combination of Aubrey Beardsley and the work of the Arts and Crafts
    movement; Bradley "transformed their styles into exceptionally bold and
    successful designs" (Word and Image p. 20). "Because of his early training
    as a printer, Bradley's posters are distinguished by their good taste in
    typography which is an integral part of the design" (Margolin p. 27). As
    with so many posters in America at the height of the poster craze in the mid
    1890s, this one was given an affectionate name: <i>In Purple and White.</i>
    Larger than most of Bradley's other posters, it is "his simplest, boldest,
    and therefore most modern creation" (Koch p. 99). And yet, despite the
    absence of the intricate detail that defined so much of Bradley's work, his
    style still carefully reflects the product advertised. "Here, spokes might
    have marred the composition of the poster and their absence gives a feeling
    of lightness and airiness to the bicycle and the entire design" (Bicycle p.
    9). Kiehl Cover & 27, DFP-I 165, Richmond 30, Reims 1148, Maitres pl. 152,

    Edward Penfield is universally considered to be the first major homegrown
    American poster artist. As Art Director for <i>Harper's</i> (from
    1891-1900), it was his idea to issue monthly, small-format posters promoting
    the publication. The posters were so popular that many other "little
    magazines" followed suit. Large posters are quite rare amongst Penfield's
    work (and among Turn-of-the-Century American posters in general). Like his
    large-scale poster for <i> Orient Cycles</i>, this print also leaves a blank
    template at the bottom for additional printed information to be added. Kiehl

  TYPESET: >-
    Franz Griessler studied painting in Vienna and designed his first poster
    after World War I. He opened a design studio in partnership with Gewista, a
    large outdoor advertising agency, for which he produced a number of
    successful campaigns. For unexplained reasons he left Austria in 1947 and is
    believed to have died in Honolulu in the 1970s. Curiously, different cities
    developed radically different approaches towards cabaret posters. Parisian
    cabarets are portrayed as being lighthearted and joyful. Nightclubs in
    Berlin are depicted in a rougher, and far less humorous manner. And cabaret
    advertising in Vienna and Munich took an intriguingly decadent slant. This
    poster echoes the spirit of Walter Schnackenberg, king of the decadent
    cabaret posters. It depicts a strange, almost clownish character, leering
    over the shoulder of a young lady, who, on the contrary, has a simple and
    charming appearance. Engulfed in a voluminous fur stole, her arm cleverly
    splits the image in half, and an oversized cocktail glass completes the
    composition.

    This 1st printing was produced before the concert on two different kinds of
    paper - one, a thick poster board and the other, a thin regular stock
    version. In the summer of 1967, Bill Graham took two of his San Francisco
    favorites to Canada - The Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. The series
    of shows took place at Toronto's O'Keefe Centre. There are hard-to-verify
    stories that the original cache of posters was confiscated at the Canadian
    border by border patrol, but we don't know for sure if the posters were
    seized or simply stowed away by Canadian fans. Perhaps because of this,
    BG-074 is among the <i>rarest</i> of concert posters.

    In 1924, the Eighth Olympic games were held in Chamonix. One year later,
    "these successful Games were retrospectively recognized at the
    [International Olympic Committee] Congress in Prague as the first Olympic
    Winter Games" (Olympics p. 35). The decision to hold these winter games came
    in 1921, and "triggered a period of frenzied construction as rail and road
    links and hotel development opened up the area to international tourism"
    (Ibid p. 33). This is one of five official posters for these winter games,
    all of which were published by the PLM Railway, rather than by the Olympic
    Committee. They were all issued with text variants, sometimes promoting the
    Olympic Games and sometimes just promoting winter activities in the area
    itself. A variation of this image exists with the additional text "Sports
    D'Hiver à l'Occasion de la VIIIe Olympiade / 25 Janvier-5 Fevrier 1924."

    things, a routine for the weekly ice shows done in a polar bear costume.

    Lacaze was a landscape painter who began designing posters for the French
    railway companies in 1910. His well-composed images are consistently
    colorful and detailed, often including local architectural or structural
    highlights, but rarely feature people. Working primarily for the Cornille &
    Serre printing house, his prodigious output includes images for the PLM,
    Chemins de fer de l'Etat, Chemins de fer du Midi and the Belgian Chemins de
    fer d'Alsace et de Lorraine, among others. Lacaze belongs to a talented
    group of French Art Deco travel poster designers whose works are recognized
    as the archetypal style of the era. Here, we see his view of the Place de la
    Concorde, with the Obelisk of Luxor, and the Fontaine de Mers in the
    foreground (the Fontaine des Fleuves being obscured) and in the background
    the Madeleine, visible at the end of Rue Royale. One in a series of posters
    published in the mid 1930s by Les Grands Réseaux de Chemins de Fer Francais,
    as opposed to any single railway line, promoting travel to Paris.

    Andersen was one of the most prolific Danish poster designers between the

    For this International Aircraft Meeting, he produced a sophisticated graphic
    of three planes circling a globe upon which is a Danish flag, planted at the
    top. The way he plays with the shadows and evokes the site of the event
    using only the Danish flag, on a globe that is otherwise unmarked,
    underscores his exquisite graphic design capabilities. This is the Danish

    began his artistic career designing chocolate boxes and candy wrappers for a
    Melbourne confectioner. He soon opened his own studio and went on to design
    hundreds of travel posters. Known for his "bright, colorful and optimistic

    Estonian-born Sellheim studied architecture in Germany and Austria before
    migrating to Australia in 1926. He worked as an architect for two years and
    then began designing posters. Along with James Northfield and Percy Trompf,
    Sellheim is considered to be one of the finest artists to design travel
    posters in Australia in the 1930s. He brings to his work an element of the
    European avant-garde, and his posters are "distinguished by their innovative
    design, in particular the use of montage" (Trading Places 29). He is most
    famous for designing the flying kangaroo logo for Qantas airlines. Poster
    Art in Australia p. 42.

    A world-renowned and recognized corporate icon, Air India's Maharaja was
    born in 1946, the creative genius of Air India's commercial director, Bobby
    Kooka, and Umesh Rao, an artist with the Mumbai branch of J. Walter Thompson
    Ltd. "The Maharaja began merely as a rich Indian potentate, symbolizing
    graciousness and high living. And somewhere along the line his creators gave
    him a distinctive personality, his outsized mustache, the striped turban and
    his aquiline nose . . . Air-India calls him the Maharaja for want of a
    better description. But his blood isn't blue. He may look like royalty, but
    he isn't royal . . . Today, this naughty, diminutive Maharaja of Air-India
    has become a world figure. He can be a lover boy in Paris, a sumo wrestler
    in Tokyo, a pavement artist, a Red Indian, a monk. He can effortlessly flirt
    with the beauties of the world. And most importantly, he can get away with
    it all. Simply, because he is the Maharaja" (The Chandigarh Tribune, July
    17, 2005).

    Launched in 1953, the <i>Andrea Doria</i> was one of the most elegant liners
    of her era. She is pictured here with her sister ship <i>Cristoforo
    Colombo</i>, against a collage of nautical flags. She was designed with an
    eye towards modernity and luxury rather than speed, and was filled with
    original artwork that added to her sophistication. Eclipsing her style and
    grace was the tragedy that brought her short career to an end. In 1956, off
    the shore of Nantucket, the <i>Andrea Doria</i> was hit by the
    <i>Stockholm</i> and sank soon thereafter. Ciuti was an architect and
    industrial designer, often cited along with Marcello Nizzoli and Bruno
    Munari as one of the top Italian designers of the 1930s and 40s.

    A painter who emigrated from Germany, Maurer brought the European tradition
    of Modernist poster design to America. Although best known for his ski
    posters, Maurer also did a lot of poster work for both the New Haven

    posters promoting travel to the New York World's Fair, each with a similar
    bird's-eye view concept of Manhattan and the famed Trylon and Perisphere. We
    believe this to be his only image for the New York Central Line, featuring

    Steaming through an autumn landscape while making the run between New York

    50th anniversary in 1941, the New York Central Line inaugurated the "New"
    Empire State Express. According to the hyperbolic commentary written in a
    booklet released by the railroad for the occasion, this train, "which is

    it." The railroad also used this poster image for the cover of a brochure.

    A patriotic crossover poster produced during World War II by the New York

    known for his straightforward, graphic depictions of trains and prominent
    destinations along the New York Central Line system, takes his art one step
    further here and adds a patriotic element. It is a powerful, proud and
    evocative image of a New York Central Line Mohawk locomotive coursing
    through the night beneath the eternal vigilance of the Statue of Liberty.
    The connection between the symbol of America's Liberty and the commanding
    representation of America's physical and technological power is enhanced by
    the engine's headlamp and the Statue's torch, each cutting through the

    Bern Hill was a graphic designer and painter. He "worked for the Kudner
    Agency, a New York City advertising firm. At the end of 1949, General
    Motors' Electro-Motive Division embarked on a rather radical advertising
    campaign which included vertical format streamline style paintings for the
    covers of <i>Railway Age</i>" (Vintage Rails, January / February 1998, p.
    64). Between 1950 and 1956, Hill painted 65 paintings. "Electro-Motive also
    produced a series of very high-grade posters of Hill's paintings that were
    overwritten by the marketing theme for that particular railroad . . . it is
    unknown if all 65 paintings were turned into posters . . . Hill's assignment
    was to portray the 'feel' of each railroad in a scene that often captured
    the landscape of the individual road and gave the viewer the sense of that
    road's missions - freight, passenger or switching" (Railroad Heritage, No.

  TYPESET: >-
    Dr. Fritz Kahn was an Orthodox Jewish gynecologist in Berlin, who published
    popular illustrated books including <i>The Cell</i> and <i>The Jews as a
    Race and Cultural People</i>. In his books and articles, he "visualized the
    structure and function of the human body in a very unique way."
    (http://www.fritz-kahn.com). This poster of <i>The Human as Industrial
    Palace</i> is exemplary of one of his conceptual designs, presenting a
    playful but instructive comparison between industrialism and anatomy, and
    elevating the traditional medical diagram into 20th century graphic design.
    When the Nazis took power, Kahn's books were banned and publicly burned, and
    Kahn left Germany for Palestine and then the U.S., with the help of his
    friend Albert Einstein. While some of his works were translated into
    English, without the resources to produce new books, Kahn fell into
    obscurity. His innovative designs were still influential to future artists,
    and the first exhibition of his works, <i>Fritz Kahn - Maschine Mensch</i>,
    opened in Berlin in 2010 and featured this mechanical image. Includes the
    full poster, a second smaller poster, five bound volumes of <i>Das Leben des
    Menschen</i> (The Life of Man, 1922-1931), a blank and white photo and
    additional foldouts. Images available upon request.

    Czech artist Mathilde Flögl studied at the Vienna Kunstgewerbeschule, where
    she studied under Josef Hoffmann and Oskar Strnad. She joined the Wiener
    Werkstätte in 1916 and created decorative arts in numerous categories
    including textile, wallpaper, book design, posters, ceramic, glass and
    enameling. For the 25th anniversary of the Wiener Werkstätte, Flögl wrote
    and published <i>The Wiener Werkstätte, 1903-1928: The Evolution of the
    Modern Applied Arts Exhibitions</i>. In the 1920s, she was a member of the
    Wiener Frauenkunst - a group of women artists who broke away from the
    patriarchal art world and held many exhibitions in Vienna. She was also a
    member of the Austrian Werkbund, for whom she designed this exhibition
    poster with its strong geometric and typographic Bauhaus influences.

  TYPESET: >-
    Steinberg worked for <i>The New Yorker</i> for nearly 60 years, during which
    time he created almost 90 covers and over 1200 drawings for the magazine.
    The concept and rendering of this image are a perfect demonstration of
    Steinberg's sense of the absurd, which was an instrumental part of his work.
    This image is by far his most famous. It originally appeared as a cover of
    the magazine on March 29, 1976, and became so popular that it was issued in
    this poster format.
