    Signed in chalk, lower left recto. <br><br>Provenance: Elizabeth
    Hamilton-Jeffrey Wortman, Inc., New York; sold to private collection, New
    York, October 1989.<br><br>Mengs (1728-1779) was born in Bohemia,
    present-day Czech Republic, to a family of artists.  His father, who trained
    him, was a court painter in Dresden.  In 1740, Mengs moved with his father
    to Rome, where the young artist learned to emulate Raphael and Correggio and
    established himself as a precocious talent.  Mengs moved back to Dresden in
    1744 to build his career before settling in Rome in 1752, where he stayed
    for the rest of his life.  With art historian and Hellenist Johann Joachim
    Winckelmann, Mengs helped to revive interest in classical antiquity.  Mengs
    heralded Neoclassicism, the style championed by artists into the early 19th
    century and beyond.  This pared down, simplistic style rooted in symmetry,
    was also practiced by Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825) and
    Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780-1867).

  year: '1814'
  TYPESET: >-
    Oil on canvas, circa 1814.  476x376 mm; 18¾x14¾ inches.<br><br>Provenance:
    Private collection, New York.<br><br>Granet (1775-1849) was a French painter
    and curator known for his paintings of church and convent interiors.  He was
    born in Aix-en-Provence, studied art in France, and relocated to Italy where
    he lived for 21 years as a member of a French artist community, including
    Neoclassical painters Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780-1867) and
    François-Xavier Fabre (1766-1837).  Granet created this composition during
    Napoleon's occupation of Rome, when the Capuchin order had been banished
    from the seventeenth-century church in the city center.  Granet mourned the
    peaceful cloister before it was dissolved and sought to capture its
    serenity.  Among his most favored subjects, he claimed that he painted
    different iterations of <i>Santa Maria dell'Immacolata Concezione</i> at
    least fifteen times.

  TYPESET: >-
    Etching and engraving printed in dark brown, 1807.  184x260 mm; 7¼x10¼
    inches, full margins.  Second state (of 5).  From <i>Liber Studiorum</i>.  A
    superb, richly-inked, early impression.  <br><br><i>Jason</i> is part of a
    series of 81 prints created by Turner (1775-1851) and other printmakers,
    after his oils, that have come to be known as the <i>Liber Studiorum</i>
    (Book of Studies, in Latin).  This series is based on original watercolors
    by Turner derived from his paintings, essentially a visual catalogue
    <i>raisonné</i> of all his works.<br><br>History, literature and myth were
    profound sources of inspiration for Turner.  This particular composition
    derives from Apollonius Rhodius's epic Greek poem, <i>Argonautica</i>,
    written in the 3rd century BCE.  The tale chronicles mythical Greek hero
    Jason and his voyage to retrieve the legendary Golden Fleece.  In Turner's
    depiction, Jason scales a fallen tree to approach the dragon guarding the
    Fleece.  <i>Argonautica</i> profoundly influenced Latin poets like Catullus
    and Ovid, and it served as a framework for Virgil's Roman national epic, the
    <i>Aeneid</i>.  Finberg 6.

  TYPESET: >-
    Etching, aquatint and mezzotint printed in dark brown, 1812. 178x267 mm;
    7x10½ inches, full margins.  First state (of 7).   From <i>Liber
    Studiorum</i>.  A superb, richly-inked and early impression.
    <br><br><i>Calm</i> is part of a series of 81 mezzotints created by Turner
    (1775-1851) and other printmakers, after his oils, that have come to be
    known as the <i>Liber Studiorum</i> (Book of Studies, in Latin).  The "M" in
    the top margin of this print indicates Turner's category of Marine
    landscape.  The <i>Liber Studiorum</i> mezzotints are based on original
    watercolors by Turner derived from his paintings, essentially a visual
    catalogue <i>raisonné</i> of all his works.  It's assumed that Turner
    approved of the mezzotint process as it simulated the appearance of
    watercolor on moist paper and, in recognition of their commercial
    viability.  The 1820 introduction of steel mezzotint plates (as opposed to
    copper, which produced very limited quality impressions before the plate
    wore down and required reworking) may have prompted him to issue these
    prints.  Finberg 44.

    <br><br>Daumier (1808-1879), a prolific caricaturist, printmaker, painter
    and sculptor, demonstrated an artistic inclination at a young age.  He
    quickly became a <i>protégé</i> of the classicist painter Alexandre Lenoir
    (1761-1839), and further advanced his artistic training by enrolling in the
    Acadèmie Suisse, Paris.  Daumier mastered the technique of lithography early
    on in his career, and published his first (of several hundred) lithographs
    in the satirical periodical <i>La Silhouette</i> in 1829.

    student and assistant in 1882.  The two were said to have a tumultuous
    relationship with two distinct working styles; Whistler being the legendary
    perfectionist.  They often worked from the same model, though Sickert's
    painting tended to lend itself more to the Impressionist style.  Sickert and
    Whistler became estranged in October 1896 after the former failed to
    apologize for associating with Sir William Eden, with whom Whistler had a
    lawsuit (Whistler was unsatisfied with the payment he received for <i>Brown
    and Gold: Portrait of Lady Eden</i> and refused to release the painting to
    Eden).  In what seemed like a reciprocal blow, Whistler sided against
    Sickert when artist Joseph Pennell (1857-1926) brought a libel action
    against him in 1897.  Despite their complicated interpersonal relationships,
    Pennell and Sickert knew Whistler best, and worked to authenticate his works
    after his death.  As the University of Glasgow states, however, "either
    through a lack of judgement, scrupulousness, or, in Sickert's case, from
    sheer devilment, authentications by them are by no means reliable." Way 79;

    She died on May 10th, 1896.  Whistler's years of marriage with Beatrix, whom

    of the Biedermeier era.  He was originally trained as a pharmacist, studying
    at the University of Munich, but dedicated himself fully to painting upon
    receiving an inheritance and recovering from an illness.  Spitzweg was a
    self-taught painter and traveled widely through Europe studying art
    independently.  The Biedermeier style flourished in Central Europe from 1815
    to 1848, a time where the middle class grew and art reflected an air of
    leisure and comfort of the time.  Spitzweg's work, and Biedermeier art in
    general, commonly depicted warm, idyllic and sentimental genre scenes of
    middle class life.

    placement of Dante's <i>Commedia</i> at the top of this list reflects the

    in this circle swirl about in the wind, swept helplessly through the stormy
    air.  These are the lustful—those who committed sins of the flesh.  Dante
    asks Virgil to identify some of the individual souls to him; they include
    many of great renown, including Helen, for whose sake the Trojan War was
    fought, and Cleopatra. Dante immediately feels sympathy for these souls, for
    essentially, they are damned by love.  With Virgil’s permission, he calls
    out to the souls to see if they will speak to him and tell him their story.
    One woman, Francesca, recognizes Dante as a living soul and answers him. 
    She relates to him how love was her undoing: bound in marriage to an old and
    deformed man, she eventually fell in love with Paolo da Rimini, her
    husband’s younger brother.  One day, as she and Paolo sat reading an
    Arthurian legend about the love of Lancelot and Guinevere, each began to
    feel that the story spoke to their own secret love.  When they came to a
    particularly romantic moment in the story, they could not resist kissing. 
    Francesca’s husband quickly discovered their transgression and had the young
    lovers killed.  Now Paolo and Francesca are doomed to spend eternity in the
    Second Circle of Hell.  Overcome with pity, Dante faints.

    <br><br>This etching appeared in the deluxe edition of Georges Lecomte's
    1892 <i>L'Art impressionniste d'après la collection privée de M.
    Durand-Ruel</i>, with works reproduced from the collection of the famed
    Parisian dealer and champion of Impressionism Paul Durand-Ruel.  The artist
    A. M. Lauzet made many of the etchings after the paintings in Durand-Ruel's
    collection for the book.  According to Reed and Shapiro, "Degas was
    dissatisfied with Lauzet's prints and made two of his own.  Apparently, he
    did not complete the project, for two other prints by Lauzet that reproduce
    Degas's paintings, <i>Avant la course</i> and <i>Ballet de Don Juan</i>,
    were included in the book."  Lauzet's renditions of the other two Degas
    subjects, <i>Chevaux dans le pré</i> and <i>Danseuse sur scène, saluant</i>,
    which are known in proof impressions, are conventional and in the
    same-direction as their prototypes, whereas Degas's etchings of these two
    subjects are worked more loosely and in reverse of his own paintings (which
    indicates that he produced them on the etching plates freehanded with his
    paintings as a guide).  Adhémar 58; Reed and Shapiro 57.

    Signed by both Monet and Thornley in pencil, lower margin. With Thornley's
    red ink stamp, lower margin. Printed by Belfond, Paris, with the blind stamp
    (Lugt 225d, lower right). From <i>L'Album de 20 lithographies d'après les
    tableaux de Claude Monet</i>. A superb, well-inked impression of this very
    scarce lithograph.<br><br>At the end of the 19th century, Monet (1840-1926),
    Edgar Degas (1834-1917) and Camille Pissarro (1830-1903) rediscovered
    lithography as a medium both to recreate their artistic conceptions on paper
    and, simultaneously achieve widespread distribution of and acclamation for
    their work. These artists, who had invented new ways of transmitting
    impressions of light and color, engaged George William Thornley (1857-1935),
    an accomplished English lithographer and admirer of the Impressionists, to
    translate their designs into lithographs. The prints that emerged from these
    collaborative efforts are the only lithographs in color, save one by
    Pissarro, by these great Impressionist artists.<br><br>Until he met
    Thornley, Monet had evidenced no interest in making prints. Unlike Degas and
    Pissarro, who etched on copper and drew on stone or transfer paper, or
    Cézanne, Sisley and Renoir, who collaborated with Auguste Clot, the talented
    Parisian master printer, to create color lithographs, Monet either found
    printmaking too daunting or did not seek the public acclaim for his work
    that printmaking could provide. However, he was able to find a hospitable
    partner in Thornley. The resulting collaborative lithographs of landscapes,
    seascapes and portraits are informed with the elusive and shimmering light
    of his iconic Impressionist oil paintings.<br><br>This print is based on
    Monet's 1891 painting of the same title, from his series <i>Les Meules à
    Giverny</i>, in which he created 25 paintings of haystacks at different
    times of day and year, to explore the way changing light and atmosphere
    impacts visual perception of the same subject.

    Private collection, Chicago.<br><br>Schuffenecker (1851-1934) was a French
    Post-Impressionist artist, painter, art teacher and art collector.  A friend
    of Paul Gauguin (1848-1903) and Odilon Redon (1840-1916), and one of the
    first collectors of works by Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890), Schuffenecker was
    instrumental in establishing, with Gauguin, the seminal Volpini exhibition,
    in 1889.  Schuffenecker and Gauguin were colleagues at the brokerage Bertin
    during the mid-1870s, where they became close friends.  In their spare time,
    both studied the Old Masters at the Louvre, Paris, and worked at the
    Académie Colarossi.   In 1880, Schuffenecker married a cousin, Louise
    Lançon; their daughter Jeanne, the subject of the current work, was born in
    1882, their son Paul in 1884.   As the economic situation decreased in the
    early 1880s, Schuffenecker and Gauguin had nevertheless gained enough money
    to leave Bertin and both opted for a career in the arts.  After the Paris
    Bourse crashed in January 1882, Gauguin chose to remain independent,
    Schuffenecker decided to apply for the diploma to teach.  Two years later,
    he was appointed to teach drawing at the Lycée Michelet in Vanves, along
    with his friend the painter Louis Roy (1862-1907).  In 1884, Schuffenecker
    exhibited with the Société des Artistes Indépendants and, in 1886, the
    Impressionists in their eighth and final exhibition.

    "<i>Roses</i> was painted shortly before Van Gogh's release from the asylum
    at Saint–Rémy. He felt he was coming to terms with his illness—and himself.
    In this healing process, painting was all–important. During those final
    three weeks of his recovery, he wrote his brother Theo, he had 'worked as in
    a frenzy. Great bunches of flowers, violet irises, big bouquets of roses . .
    .' This is one of two rose paintings Van Gogh made at that time. It is among
    his largest and most beautiful still lifes, with an exuberant bouquet in the
    glory of full bloom. Although he sometimes assigned certain meanings to
    flowers, Van Gogh did not make a specific association for roses. It is
    clear, though, that he saw all blossoming plants as celebrations of birth
    and renewal--as full of life. That sense is underscored here by the fresh
    spring green of the background."  Ginestet/Pouillon 651 (Villon).

    painting landscapes directly from nature.  He is known for his unique

    The artist, Mora; the sitter, Frederick Keppel, New York, with the black ink
    stamp (Lugt 1023, lower left verso); private collection, Florida.<br><br>A
    preparatory drawing for Zorn's (1860-1920) etching, <i>Frederick Keppel
    I</i> (see Asplund 141; Hjert/Hjert 92).  Keppel (1845-1912) was an
    important gallerist in New York at the forefront of the Etching Revival in
    the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  He was born in Tullow, Ireland and
    studied at Wesley College, Dublin.  He and his family moved to Canada and
    then to the United States in 1862.  Early on Keppel resolved to be a farmer,
    but he sustained an injury that prevented him from most physical labor.  He
    remembered, "Next after farming I think I liked books best, and so I made my
    way to New York and engaged in that most interesting business, a
    bookseller's."  Keppel arrived in New York and opened Frederick Keppel &
    Company in 1868.  Though at first having no knowledge of fine art prints,
    Keppel found his way into initially selling portfolios.  Through his
    relationships abroad and his ability to lecture and write about the subject,
    Keppel nurtured the public's interest in prints, launching numerous
    publications of artist's works and the <i>Print-Collector's Quarterly</i> in
    1911.  He was known to have forged friendships with the artists he
    represented, notably Zorn, James A. M. Whistler, Jean-François Millet, Fèlix
    Buhot and Joseph Pennell.  Like many of those who knew Whistler, Keppel had
    a frought relationship with the artist, Keppel's pamphlet, </i>The Gentle
    Art of Resenting Injuries</i> was a direct, albeit entertaining, response to
    Whistler's <i>The Gentle Art of Making Enemies</i>.

    artists." The artist Armand Seguin (1869-1903) was a close friend of Gauguin
    (1848-1903) during the late 1880s and early 1890s.  Based on the etched
    inscription upper left, "Chez Seguin à St. Julien," the scene takes place at
    Seguin's Breton home in Pouldu. Current scholarship regarding authorship for
    the print leans toward Gauguin, in its similarities to other of his Breton
    female portrait compositions.  Kornfeld 25.

    poster to show both Jane Avril and Yvette Guilbert, the two Montmartre
    <i>demimondes</i> who were both his friends and major inspirations.  Jane
    Avril, the star dancer at the Moulin Rouge, is in profile seated next to the
    literary critic, Édouard Dujardin.  On stage in the background, Guilbert is
    depicted from the neck down, recognizable by her trademark long black
    gloves.  The composition is arranged along the diagonal of the stage and the
    orchestra pit in the style of Japanese <i>Ukiyo-e</i> woodcuts that were so
    fashionable in Paris at the end of the 19th century and from which artists
    from the Impressionists to Gauguin and Van Gogh drew influence.  Delteil

    With the artist's monogram red ink stamp (Lugt 1545, lower right recto).  A
    brilliant, richly-inked impression with strong contrasts and deep black,
    velvety burr throughout. <br><br>Tissot (1836-1902) was a successful French
    society artist; his artworks portray fashionable women and 19th century life
    that embody Victorian and Belle Époque aesthetics.  The child of Catholic
    textile merchants, he moved from his native Nantes to Paris in 1856 to study
    art with Louise Lamothe and Hippolyte Faldrin, who were <i>protégés</i> of
    Ingres.  He also met Édouard Manet (1832-1883), Edgar Degas (1834-1917) and
    James A. M. Whistler (1834-1903), with whom he maintained ties throughout
    his life. Tissot was exiled to London in 1871 after his involvement with the
    Paris Commune in the Franco-Prussian War.  In London, Tissot's portraits of
    women and 19th century life quickly gained popularity and he became among
    the most successful, renowned artists of his day.  Tissot was inspired by
    many of Whistler's etchings and paintings, borrowing similar subjects, such
    as views of the Thames, and influences, such as from Japanese
    prints.<br><br>Tissot made his first etchings while studying in
    Paris—epicenter of the later 19th century etching revival—in the 1860s and
    revisited the medium again in 1875-85.  As a printmaker, Tissot primarily
    used the medium to skillfully reproduce his own paintings (rather than sell
    the reproductive rights to his work to other publishers and printers).  The
    market for reproductive prints in England was exceedingly strong during this
    time (prompted by the concurrent etching revival in England, supported by
    the English Etching Club) and Tissot found the sale of his etchings a highly
    lucrative segment of his artistic output.  Unlike many of his
    contemporaries, Tissot did not experiment with etching to make original
    works but instead only used it as a way of replicating (or revisiting) his
    painted subjects.  Throughout the production of his prints he maintained a
    consistent approach to etching that employed meticulous detail and rich
    tonality, which resulted in a cohesive, focused <i>oeuvre</i>. <br><br>The
    etching <i>Octobre</i> is based on the same-titled painting from 1877, now
    in the Montreal Museum of Art, and follows many of the standard influences
    in Tissot's work from the 1870s—including Japanese prints and photography. 
    The composition with a single full figure is reminiscent of Japanese
    <i>Ukiyo-e</i> paintings of the Kaigetsudo School of the early 18th
    century.  Tissot also frequently used photography to help provide
    compositional details that lent an immediacy to some of his compositions. 
    The woman depicted is young Irish divorcée Mrs. Kathleen Newton, Tissot's
    frequent model and companion.  The two met in 1875 and from 1876 until her
    death in 1882 they lived together in Tissot's home in St. John's Wood—Tissot
    would describe these years as the happiest of his life.  After Mrs. Newton's
    death in 1882, Tissot moved back to Paris and began producing artwork
    focused on religious subject matter, spending the last two years of his life
    in an Abbey in Buillon, France.  Wentworth 33.

    pencil, lower left.  Etched by Jacques Villon. Published by Galerie
    Berheim-Jeune, Paris. A superb impression with strong
    colors.<br><br>Rousseau (1844-1910) was a French self-taught
    Post-impressionist painter. He is nicknamed <i>Le Douanier</i> (the customs
    officer) from his career as a toll and tax collector. Rousseau began
    painting after his retirement and is best known for his jungle scenes
    rendered in a Primitive style. He never traveled outside of France, but was
    deeply inspired by zoos and botanical gardens in France, as well as tableaux
    of taxidermied wild animals, claiming that he had "no teacher other than
    nature." Ridiculed by critics for most of his art career, Rousseau was
    unaffected by the negative feedback and continued to paint and show his
    work. Pablo Picasso happened upon a painting of Rousseau's in 1908 and
    immediately recognized his talent; he proceeded to meet with Rousseau and
    host a banquet in his studio in Rousseau's honor. Ginestet/Pouillon 641.

    authenticity of this work.<br><br>Rodin's (1840-1917) drawings and works on
    paper rarely served as preliminary sketches for his sculptures, in fact the
    majority were created by Rodin studying his own earlier sculptures or that
    by other artists, including Michelangelo.  Rodin simplified these figures to
    near abstraction and often floated them against a wash of color on the
    sheet, creating dynamism by removing context.

    born in Philadelphia, was a painter, printmaker and successful children's
    book illustrator.  She was a member of the pioneering woodblock print
    society–the first of its kind in America–known as the Provincetown
    Printers.  This small group of printmakers came together in 1915 in the
    artistic community of Provincetown on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, which had
    become a destination for <i>avante-garde</i> American artists and European
    artists fleeing the turmoil of World War I.  The group remains most
    noteworthy for having innovated the white-line woodcut print, known as “the
    Provincetown Print.”  Smith exhibited her work regularly in Provincetown in
    the 1920s and 1930s, as well as at her summer art colony in Rehoboth Beach,
    Delaware, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, and the
    Woodmere Art Museum, Philadelphia.

    etching.<br><br>Gorky (1904-1948) was a profound figure in American art,
    celebrated for his blending of European Surrealism into Abstract
    Expressionism.  He is considered one of the first Abstract Expressionists,
    paving the way to the movement with his highly original, lyrical and
    rhythmic compositions.  Gorky, born as Vostanik Manoog Adoyanm, emigrated to
    the U.S. in 1920 and changed his name to escape the Armenian genocide.  He
    studied at the New School of Design in Boston, and the Grand Central School
    of Art in New York.  His work evolved drastically throughout his career as
    he studied the works of artists he admired, such as Pablo Picasso, Paul
    Cézanne and Joan Miró.  Gorky stressed the importance of studying from the
    masters and came to his distinct style through years of continuous
    experimentation and innovation.

    1929 before settling in Mexico in 1936.  She studied drawing and engraving
    at the Escuela Nocturna para Trabajadores before continuing her training at
    the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura, y Grabado, Mexico City, in
    1942.<br><br>She was one of four students, nicknamed "Los Fridos," who
    studied under Frida Kahlo at her home in Mexico City, the Casa Azul.  Rabel
    apprenticed with the important muralists Diego Rivera (1886-1957) and David
    A. Siqueiros (1896-1974), and completed numerous murals herself, including
    her most significant work <i>La Ronda en el Tiempo</i>, 1964 , located in
    the Museo Nacional de Antropología, Mexico City.  She was a member of the
    Salón de la Plástica Mexicana and the Taller de Gráfica Popular.  Her work
    focused on themes of injustice, Mexican culture and family, and later in her
    career she created work related to ecology.

    New York; private collection, Chicago.<br><br>A Zapotec Native American,
    born to working class parents in the small town of Ocotlán de Morelos,
    Morales (1925-2001) was a solitary child who gravitated to art.  From 1948
    to 1953 he studied art at the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City.  He
    graduated with a specialty in drawing and began a 32-year career as an art
    teacher at Escuela Nacional Preparatoria, a position he held from 1953 until
    1985.  Morales is best known for his brightly colored surrealistic
    dream-like canvases and collages, made at the height of his career, often
    featuring Mexican women in village settings.  He was notable for his
    restoration of historic buildings in Ocotlán de Morelos and, together with
    Rufino Tamayo and Francisco Toledo, helped make Oaxaca in Southern Mexico a
    center for contemporary art and tourism.<br><br>A similar painting, and
    possibly a pendant to the current work, was sold at Bonhams, New York,

    artists from Rembrandt van Rijn to Vincent van Gogh, Balla (1871-1958)
    painted more than 90 portraits of himself over the course of his productive
    career.  These self-portraits bear witness to not only his physical aging
    with the elapse of time, but also his ever present spiritual spark and his
    strong experimental streak.  By the time Balla painted this early
    self-portrait, he had settled in Rome after completing his studies at the
    Albertina Academy of Fine Arts in Turin.  He had forged close relationships
    with fellow artists Umberto Boccioni and Gino Severini; the group would
    become the core of the Italian Futurist movement.  During this time, Balla's
    work was concerned with capturing the effects of light, evident in the
    treatment of the brim of his hat, the tip of his nose, and his mustache and
    expressing his individuality (he wrote during this time, "mangia e veste a
    modo suo" or "one eats and dresses in his own way").<br><br>Balla's
    daughter, Elica, described this early self-portrait by her father in <i>Con
    Balla</i> as an image of a man in a single moment, desperately looking for
    opportunity, with his hat and upturned collar.  It ranks among the most
    striking self portraits by an artist at the outset of a career, with a
    breathtaking self presence in character and a bravura handling of the
    medium.  As this early work demonstrates, Balla's knack for depicting the
    dynamism and potential of movement in a single moment in time would become a
    hallmark of the Futurist movement of which he was a leading figure.

    <br><br><i>Marie Thérèse considérant son effigie surréaliste sculptée</i> is
    one of 100 different etchings from the <i>Vollard Suite</i>, a series
    Picasso (1881-1977) produced from 1930 to 1937 for Parisian publisher
    Ambroise Vollard.  While over 300 sets were printed, complete suites are
    scarce, instead the prints from this series now are often found
    individually.<br><br>The suite spans the years of Picasso's passionate,
    sometimes tumultuous affair with his teenage model and muse Marie-Thérèse
    Walter.  Many of the earlier works in the series portray a sculptor in his
    studio among his work—alluding to the classical myth of Pygmalion.  The
    later prints become increasingly dark as both his relationship with
    Marie-Thérèse waned and Europe entered World War II.<br><br>Marie-Thérèse
    became pregnant with Picasso's child in 1934 (their daughter Maya
    Widmaier-Picasso, born September 5, 1935).  Her pregnancy marked the end of
    Picasso's then marriage to the Ballet Russe dancer Olga Koklova and also the
    beginning of the end of his relationship with his young model (just one year
    later he would meet Dora Maar— with whom Marie-Thérèse would become
    embattled over Picasso's affection).<br><br>The onset of World War II and
    the sudden death of the publisher Vollard in a car crash in the south of
    France in 1939 delayed the distribution of this important suite, certainly
    one of the most groundbreaking print series ever created by an artist, it
    was not released until the 1950s.  Bloch 187; Geiser 346.

    pour des textes de Buffon</i> was Picasso's (1881-1973) take on the artistic
    tradition of bestiary series.  He began the etchings in 1936 and promised
    them to his publisher Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939), who died before their
    completion, leaving Vollard's associate, Martin Fabiani, to see it to
    completion.  "The master printer Lacourière had introduced Picasso, as well
    as Rouault and other artists, to the lift-ground or sugar aquatint process,
    which allowed a variety of tones and textures within a limited range. The
    spontaneity of the plates is attested by the freehand margins, the rapidly
    drawn line, and the use of fingerprints for textural variety" (The Artist &
    Book 231).  Bloch 328; Baer 575.

    <br><br>Brothers Aldo, Piero, and Milan Crommelynck were responsible for
    printing an astonishing 45 percent of Pablo Picasso’s intaglio prints. 
    Piero (or Pierre), the youngest brother, who bore a resemblance to Don
    Quixote, was the model for numerous Picasso portraits from the 1960s-70s and
    his likeness was used for Picasso’s bearded musketeer who appears frequently
    in the Celestine images of the <i>347 Gravures</i>. The Crommelynck family
    were instrumental in Picasso’s late-career productivity and kept up with the
    aging artist’s relentless pace.  Bloch 1378; Baer 1400.

    dedicatee Alexandre Mercereau (1884-1945) was a French Symbolist poet and
    critic who co-founded the utopian community <I>Abbaye de Créteil</i> during
    the fall of 1906.  According to his friend and fellow <i>Abbaye de
    Créteil</i> founder, the artist Albert Gleizes (1881-1953), Mercereau was
    responsible for introducing him to Jean Metzinger (1883-1956), Robert
    Delaunay (1885-1941) and Henri Le Fauconnier (1881-1946) in 1910—the same
    year that Mercereau curated and included these artists in a Moscow
    exhibition, probably the first <i>Knave of Diamonds Exhibition</i>, a
    foundational moment in the Cubist art movement.  By 1914, Mercereau had met
    the Spanish sculptor and pioneer of Cubism Julio González and became his
    lifelong supporter and friend.

    <i>avant-garde</i>. His early work reflects his studies of Fauvism and
    German Expressionism, and he later became deeply influenced by Cubism during
    his time in Paris in the 1910s.  He was close friends with Picasso during
    this time and drew on his groundbreaking work.  Filla later returned to
    Prague to teach at the Academy of Art, Architecture and Design and owing to
    his influence, Prague became known as the second most important center for
    Cubism after Paris.

    1985, paralleling <i>Chagall</i>, the major retrospective which emphasized
    the Russian aspects in Marc Chagall's art, with the museum label
    verso.<br><br>During his career, Burliuk (1882-1967) explored a diverse
    spectrum of artistic styles, though he always returned to a place of
    exuberance, often with vivid colors and broad brushstrokes.  As a young man,
    Burliuk studied fine arts in Odessa before attending the Munich Royal
    Academy of Arts and the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris.  In 1907, Burliuk
    settled in Moscow and befriended members of the city's <i>avant-garde</i>. 
    He attended the Moscow Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in
    1911 until his expulsion in 1913.  During these years, Burliuk was an active
    member of Russian Futurism and adhered to Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's
    <i>Manifesto of Futurism</i> which idealized progress.  Rejecting
    conventional artistic norms and public taste, Burliuk would sometimes dress
    wearing a wooden spoon for some of his art classes.<br><br>In the present
    portrait, Burliuk stressed the importance of paring down painting to the
    essential basic elements: line, surface, color and texture.  These early
    paintings were often painted on hard, coarsely textured board and seem to
    unify elements of Cubism and Futurism.   As noted in <i>ARTnews</i> in a
    1924 exhibition review, the "coarse texture gives animation to flat areas of
    color." Burliuk continued in this more abstract style until settling on Long
    Island in 1941.  It is likely also that Burliuk returned to earlier
    compositions to rework them as his style evolved.  During World War I,
    Burliuk fled Russia and travelled through Siberia, Japan and Canada
    promoting his art before reaching New York.

    39.<br><br>Galanis (1879-1966) was a Greek painter, printmaker and
    contemporary of artists like Picasso, Braque and Matisse, who had frequently
    visited Galanis at his home and studio in Montmartre.  He studied at the
    Athens School of Fine Arts before settling in Paris and attending the École
    des Beaux-Arts.  He achieved notable success during his time in Paris and
    was appointed a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts in 1945.
    <br><br><i>L'Enfant au cheval mécanique</i> is a portrait of Galanis's son
    as a child, on which he based an etching of the same title circa 1919-21.
    Gabory notes that although Galanis started this exemplary painting, "le
    tableau de Galanis le plus significatif, sa meilleure expression," in 1914,
    it was not completed until 1919 due to the artist enlisting in the French
    military during World War I (therefore becoming a naturalized French
    citizen).  This painting is evidence of the profound impact that the work of
    Cézanne and Cubism had on Galanis's paintings. <br><br>Galanis's son,
    Jean-Sebastian was born in Paris on April 13, 1910 to Galanis and his wife,
    Stéphanie-Julie Bouvier from Provence.  Stéphanie-Julie and Jean-Sebastian
    feature prominently among Galanis's subjects, the most notable of which is
    the 1920-21 oil on canvas <i>The Painter's Family</i>, now in a private
    collection.  Jean-Sebastian fought in the Free French Naval Forces during
    World War II and perished on the freighter <i>Lisieux</i>  on November 27,
    1940 off the coast of Newfoundland.  Galanis mourned his son for the rest of
    his life, keeping a portrait of him in his studio into the 1960s.

    of this large, important lithograph with strong contrasts. <br><br>Though
    famous for his paintings and sculptures, Matisse (1869-1954) was also a
    prolific printmaker, producing over 800 individual prints (typically in
    editions of 25 to 50) from 1900 to 1954. He moved freely between various
    printmaking techniques and used printmaking as an extension of his drawing
    style and process. The imagery he created often was repeated forms of
    reclining nudes, portraits or dancing bodies drawn with elegant and
    energetic contour lines.<br><br>Matisse found printmaking to be an exciting
    medium that allowed innovation while also enabling him to produce works in
    multiples to satisfy the increasing demand for his art. The wide
    dissemination and demand for Matisse's printed work undoubtedly contributed
    immensely to his position as a preeminent artist of the 20th
    century.<br><br>This lithograph is based on Matisse's same-titled oil
    painting, also from 1924, formerly in the collection of Mrs. Sidney F. Brody
    (sold Christie's, New York, May 4, 2010, lot 22).  In this pose, considered
    iconic for Matisse, the model appears to make look effortless what is a
    difficult and somewhat exerting position, revisited by Matisse at the end of
    his career in the more abstract, blue nude cut-outs from the early 1950s.

    <br><br>Sterl (1867-1932) was a prolific German painter.  He was born in
    Dresden and attended the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, later becoming a
    founding member of the Dresden Secession.  Sterl worked as a war painter
    during the First World War.  Afterwards he moved to Struppen, in Saxony,
    where he continued painting, often creating socially-conscious work.  In
    1937, two of his paintings were labeled "degenerate" by the Nazi Party and
    were removed from the Galerie Neue Meister in Dresden.  This painting of
    three stonemasons is representative of one of Sterl's most beloved subjects;
    he painted many scenes of workers, especially quarrymen, sympathetic to
    their labor since his father was also a stonemason.

    (1888-1960) was an English official war artist during both World War I and
    II.  He was enlisted in World War I and fought on the Western Front, but was
    sent back to England in January of 1915 due to an injury. The bulk of his
    artwork focused on the lives of soldiers and airmen, serving as a visual
    memory recorder of the hardships endured. In the interwar years, he created
    book illustrations and portraits, such as this one of Alice Mary
    Rothenstein.<br><br>Alice Mary Rothenstein (1869-1955) was married to
    William Rothenstein (1872-1945), another English war artist who Kennington
    befriended during his time working in France during World War I.  They were
    both appointed to document front line scenes at Montigny Farm and Devise on
    the Somme, where they came under enemy attack. When Kennington returned to
    London in March of 1918, he had around 170 charcoal, pastel, and watercolor
    drawings from his time in France. Alice Mary Rothenstein was an actress, who
    presumably posed for this drawing when Kennington returned to England after
    World War I.

    "Douane Centrale" ink stamp verso.<br><br>Provenance: Private collection,
    Chicago.<br><br>Born in Zurich, Glarner (1899-1972) spent his childhood
    around Europe, including time in Switzerland, France and Italy.  Glarner's
    artistic talent was recognized at a young age and he began his formal
    training at the Regio Instituto di Belli Arti in Naples from 1914 to 1920. 
    During these years, Glarner was cloistered from the <i>avant-garde</i>
    movements prevalent in Europe.  It was not until 1923 on a trip to Paris
    that the young artist first became immersed in abstract art.  While studying
    at the Académie Colarossi, Paris during the early 1920s, Glarner met artists
    at the <i>avant-garde</i> forefront—Sonia and Robert Delaunay, Hans Art,
    Fernand Léger and Piet Mondrian.  Subsequently, Glarner approached his
    canvases with a limited palette and simplified composition, and it would not
    be until the 1930s that his style would become totally abstract, informed by
    Mondrian's Neoplasticism.<br><br>  Glarner moved to the United States
    briefly from 1930-31, showing in New York and most notably in Katherine
    Dreier's landmark 1931 <i>An International Exhibition Illustrating the Most
    Recent Development in Abstract Art</i> at Albright-Knox Gallery, Buffalo. 
    He returned to Paris and then to Zurich until the break out of the Spanish
    Civil War in 1936, which spurred him to settle in New York permanently.

    (1862-1918), a leader of the Vienna Secession movement, rejected the
    academic style that was prevalent in Austria and most of Europe at the turn
    of the century. His artwork often incorporated undulating contour lines and
    stylized forms as well as heavy ornamentation and symbolism. This individual
    expression was lauded by Vienna's cultural circles in the last decade of the
    19th century and the early 1900s and served as a significant influence on
    Klimt's younger contemporaries.  This drawing relates to Klimt's most
    recognized work, <i>The Kiss<i> and another painting, <i>Fulfillment</i>, as
    he was developing compositions for similar themes at the time.

    that while no specific painting by Klimt (1862-1918) has been identified for
    which this and the other similar drawings are known to be studies, they may
    relate to the <i>Stoclet Frieze</i>, a series of three mosaics created by
    Klimt for a 1905-11 commission for the Palais Stoclet in Brussels. The

    Seeler, <i>Käthe Kollwitz - Die Plastik</i>, 2019, number 38 (another cast
    illustrated).<br><br><i>Die Klage</i>, or <i>The Lament</i>, was created by
    Kollwitz (1867-1945) in reaction to Nazi dictatorship, which had ostracized
    many of her colleagues and family members, including sculptor Ernst Barlach
    (1870-1938).  The sculpture served as a tribute to Barlach and a
    self-portrait of Kollwitz.  Both Barlach and Kollwitz were silenced as
    artists when their works were confiscated in 1936 by the Nazis, this is
    symbolized by the hand covering the mouth.  The other hand, covering one
    eye, represents how one could momentarily turn away from the suffering at
    the hands of the regime, but it was ever present and could not be
    ignored.<br><br>The plaster cast of <i>Die Klage</i>, conceived by Kollwitz
    from 1939-41, arrived at the Noack Foundry, Berlin, before 1942 when
    Kollwitz had two zinc casts made.  According the Seeler, it is unclear if
    these casts have survived, as a 1944 letter from Kollwitz indicates that a
    cast was damaged or destroyed, though Noack created post-war bronzes into
    the 1980s.  <br><br>Since Kollwitz's death, owing to the popularity of the
    image, there have been numerous castings of <i>Die Klage</i> made by both
    European and American foundries.  Since the dimensions and the survival of
    the original cast are unclear, it is difficult to ascertain from what source
    cast many of these editions originate.  The Boston art dealer Hyman Swetzoff
    obtained a plaster cast for <i>Die Klage</i> in 1956 and had a version  made
    at the Roman Bronze Works, New York in 1961-62.  Posthumous casts were also
    likely made from a bronze owned by Hans Kollwitz.  Heilborn 89; Guratzsch

    impression.<br><br>This is Kollwitz's (1867-1945) last printed
    self-portrait, made by the artist on the eve of World War II and following a
    life that had been ravaged by war.  Her son Peter was killed in action as a
    soldier in World War I.  She made only several proofs of this lithograph
    during her lifetime, before setting it aside during the war; the edition of
    220 was printed posthumously in 1947 by her estate.  In July 1936, Kollwitz
    and her husband were visited by the Gestapo, who threatened her with arrest
    and deportation to a Nazi concentration camp; they resolved to commit
    suicide if such a prospect became inevitable.  She outlived her husband who
    died from an illness in 1940.  She was evacuated from Berlin in 1943.  Later
    that year, her house was bombed and many drawings, prints and documents were
    lost.  Kollwitz died just 16 days before the end of World War II.  She had
    spent decades, since the death of her son, creating haunting works of art
    that showed the true horrors and cost of war.  Nevertheless, in one of her
    last journal entries before her death, she wrote, "One day, a new ideal will
    arise, and there will be an end to all wars.  I die convinced of this.  It
    will need much hard work, but it will be achieved . . . The important thing,
    until that happens, is to hold one’s banner high and to struggle."

    November 12, 1996, sale 7933, lot 85; private collection, New
    York.<br><br>From 1914 to 1917, Léger (1881-1955) fought on the front-lines
    during World War I at Argonne and Verdun.  Afterwards he reflected on his
    experience: "I was stunned by the sight of the breech of a 75 millimeter in
    the sunlight.  It was the magic of light on the white metal . . . The
    crudeness, variety, humor, and downright perfection of certain men around
    me, their precise sense of utilitarian reality and its application in the
    midst of the life-and-death drama we were in . . . made me want to paint in
    slang with all its color and mobility."  The war marked a significant
    turning-point in Léger's work; from abstract and cubist works, he
    transitioned to what became known as his "mechanical period."  Industrial
    and machine-like objects came to the forefront of his artwork and he noted,
    "I wanted brightness and intensity, so I used the machine, as others use the
    nude or the still life."  The current drawing and others like it by Léger in
    the mid-1910s, shows his shift from Cubism to what the art critic Louis
    Vauxcelles coined as "Tubism" particularly in his figures and objects such
    as wagons, machinery and trenches which were common on the front lines in
    World War I.

    collection, Chicago.<br><br>Janco (1895-1984) was a Romanian-born Israeli
    artist, architect and art theorist.  He was the co-inventor of Dadaism and a
    leading exponent of Constructivism in Eastern Europe.  In the 1910s, he
    co-edited the Romanian art magazine <i>Simbolul</i>, with Ion Vinea and
    Tristan Tzara.  Janco was a practitioner of Art Nouveau, Futurism and
    Expressionism before contributing his painting and stage design to Tzara's
    literary Dadaism.  He parted with Dada in 1919 when he and painter, Hans
    Arp, founded a Constructivist circle, <i>Das Neue Leben</i>.  He fled
    Hungary in January 1941, narrowly escaping the Bucharest Pogrom, and
    ultimately landed in Tel Aviv, then part of British Palestine.  The horrific
    brutality he witnessed during the Romanian Iron Guard and Nazi takeover of
    Bucharest informed his work around World War II and shortly thereafter, in
    particular the gruesome Straulesti Abattoir murders of Romanian Jews, among
    who was the brother of Constructivist promoter and author Jacques G. Costin,
    Janco's brother-in-law.  However, later in his career, after settling in
    Israeli, Janco began painting landscapes in optimistic tones and many
    bucolic watercolors.  Along with his significant contributions to early 20th
    century <i>avant-garde</i> art movements, he is considered one of the
    fathers of Israeli modernist art.

    current owner, private collection, New York.<br><br>This is an early work by
    Dzubas (1915-1994), who was born in Germany and fled his native country in
    1939 to move to New York.  He had no formal artistic training and started
    his art career in the United States.  He shared a studio with Helen
    Frankenthaler (1928-2011) from 1952-53, and during this time he also started
    to exhibit his work, including at the famous Ninth Street Show in 1951.  At
    this early time in his career he frequently signed his work "Friedelbald" as
    this was before he changed his name to Friedel.<br><br>Often considered part
    of the Color Field movement, his work differed from others in the group as
    he juxtaposed and crossed forms over gesso leaving them saturated—many
    artists in the movement diluted their colors.  He exhibited his work at
    significant galleries during his lifetime, including Tibor De Nagy, Leo
    Castelli Gallery and André Emmerich.  Numerous prominent museums have
    exhibited his work during the last several decades and continue to hold his
    paintings in their permanent collections, such as the Metropolitan Museum of
    Art and the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

    good impression of this scarce print with strong colors.<br><br>Veysset
    (1913-1967) studied at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts de
    Paris and began as a sculptor in the academic style before turning to
    Expressionism and ultimately abstraction by the late 1940s.  In 1949, he
    participated in the <i>Salon de la jeune sculpture</i> at the Musée Rodin,
    Paris.  During the mid-20th century, he exhibited in the popular <i>Salon
    des Réalités Nouvelles</i> at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris,
    along with Jean Arp and Sonia Delaunay.  Veysset became one of the main
    proponents of mid-century "Archi-Sculpture" and a leading French abstract
    sculptor.  In 1953, he was selected to contribute to the Mémorial des
    Martyrs de la Déportation, Paris, in collaboration with the architect
    Georges-Henri Pingusson, a memorial to the 200,000 people who were deported
    from Vichy France to the Nazi concentration camps during World War II. 
    However, Veysset pulled out of the project (inaugurated by Charles de Gaulle
    in 1962) in 1957 due to his contention with its significant modification.

    New York, with the label on the frame back; private collection, New
    York.<br><br>Xceron (1890-1967) emigrated from Greece to the United States
    when he was fourteen years old.  He studied drawing at the Corcoran School
    of Art in Washington D.C. where he perfected his skills as a draftsman. 
    However, after encounters with European modernism Xceron became fascinated
    with flat color, expressive distortion, and cubist renderings.  He moved to
    New York in 1920, exhibiting in the New York Independents’ exhibitions in
    1921 and 1922, and spent many years in Paris in the late 20's and early
    30's.  His work underwent many stylistic changes throughout his life, though
    he is best-known for his dynamic compositions of geometric forms and vibrant
    colors.  Xceron was also an active art critic, writing articles for the
    <i>Boston Evening Transcript</i> and the Paris edition of the <i>Chicago
    Tribune</i>.

    Signed and numbered 89 in ink on the justification page.  Published by
    Galerie Jeanne Bucher, Paris.  Original pasteboard folder.  Very good
    impressions.<br><br>According to the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Ernst
    (1891-1976) created these images by placing paper atop various
    materials—wood floorboards, lengths of twine, leaves, wire mesh, crumpled
    paper, crusts of bread—and rubbing the surface with a pencil or crayon.
    Inspired by the resulting textures, he added details to transform them into
    fantastical landscapes, objects, and creatures.  Ernst called his process
    <i>frottage</i> (French for “rubbing”) and claimed it as a form of
    Surrealist automatism, whereby an artist attempts to let the unconscious
    guide his hand in the creation of an image.

    Etching and drypoint, 1924-25.  275x215 mm; 10¾x8½ inches, full margins. 
    Third state (of 3).  Signed and numbered 92/100 in pencil, lower margin. 
    Printed by Louis Fort, Paris.  A very good impression of this scarce, early
    etching. <br><br>Chagall (1887-1985) was born in present-day Belarus, then
    part of the Russian Empire, to a devoutly Jewish family.  He learned to draw
    in primary school and from a local artist before continuing his studies in
    St. Petersburg.  In 1910, having found a patron to support him, Chagall
    moved to Paris and settled within the bohemian <i>avant-garde</i> community
    of painters and poets in Montparnasse.  Under the influence of the
    Expressionist and Cubist artists, in addition to the Fauves and
    Impressionists he viewed in the Paris museums, Chagall was encouraged to
    explore his nontraditional style.<br><br>During the 1910s, Chagall's palette
    grew more colorful and saturated and he became known for his figurative
    elements in arbitrary, dreamlike compositions inspired by Russian or Yiddish
    folklore and culture.  Chagall held his first solo exhibition in Berlin in
    1914 and continued to paint through World War I.  After migrating between
    Russia and Berlin, Chagall and his family again settled in Paris, where he
    learned engraving.  Ambroise Vollard commissioned him to create a series of
    etchings in 1923 and after the initial project, Chagall returned to
    printmaking throughout his long and prolific career.  Kornfeld 42.

    Nobel laureate Luigi Pirandello.  After a short experience in Paris, where
    he met the central artistic personalities of the time between 1920 and 1930,
    Pirandello entered the movement of Scuola Romana, distinguishing himself for
    originality and solitary exploration.  His painting tends towards a
    quotidian realism manifested at times in the more unpleasant and pitiless
    aspects of life, expressed through a dense and thorny pictorial matter.

    (1923-1996) was an Italian painter from Abruzzo in southern Italy.  After
    studying art in and around his hometown of Barisciano, he moved to Rome, by
    way of Rimini, settling there around 1950 and during the mid-1950s became
    one of the founders of Astralism.  In 1960, Bartolomucci moved to New York
    where he remained for two years and worked from a studio at Carnegie Hall. 
    He painted an imagined scene of the first moon landing during his time in
    New York, preceding the actual event by nearly ten years, which was
    exhibited in Washington, D.C., reproduced in American newspapers and
    acquired by the John F. Kennedy presidential collection.  Bartolomucci also
    became deeply influenced by Abstract Expressionism during his sojourn in New
    York; the style stuck with him throughout the rest of his career (he
    returned to Rome in 1963 and worked there until his death in 1996) albeit
    combined with a figural and representational edge.

    admiring the work of Old Masters such as Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669) and
    Francisco José de Goya (1746-1828).  His etchings reflect his unique
    practice of hatching and cross-hatching to build form and volume, avoiding
    descriptive outlines.  This, paired with the areas of <i>bianco
    assoluto</i>, or "absolute white," that he left in his etchings, created
    atmospheric, contemporaneous still lives.  He taught etching at the

    Marinetti and Umberto Boccioni, Severini (1883-1966) signed the <i>Manifesto
    tecnico della pittura futurista</i>, cementing his role in the Italian
    Futurist movement. Living in Paris, he became an important link between
    France and Italy for the Futurists, and organized the first Futurist
    exhibition outside of Italy at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris in 1912. 
    Aiming to depict the dynamism of modern life, many artists in the movement
    depicted burgeoning technology such as cars or machines.  Severini, on the
    other hand, leaned towards depicting the human figure in movement (often in
    dance).  After World War I, Severini moved on from Futurism, embracing
    Synthetic Cubism, and later, a Neoclassical style.  Meloni 28.

    Oil on canvas, circa 1960.  750x750 mm; 29½x29½ inches.  Signed in ink,
    lower left recto.  <br><br>Provenance: Private collection, New
    York.<br><br>Venard (1913-1999) Venard was a French post-Cubist and still
    life painter.  Known for working in a distinctive angular style, he
    accentuated the chromatic qualities of his palette through thickly applied
    impasto paint.  He enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts, but abandoned his
    studies after only two days--instead, his arts education would come from his
    work as an assistant to a master  paintings restorer at the Musée du Louvre,
    Paris.<br><br>In 1936, Venard participated in a group exhibition for a new
    art movement that derided the <i>avant-garde</i> in favor of a return to
    strict and traditional principles of craftsmanship: the <i>Forces
    Nouvelles</i>, a group which included the painters Pierre Tal-Coat and André
    Marchand.  Eventually Venard would develope his own post-Cubist style
    utilizing a wide color palette applied roughly with a palette knife,
    creating a visceral strain of the geometric aesthetic.<br><br>Throughout the
    1950s, Venard’s paintings became more abstracted, as in this current scene
    of Venice.  The artist’s works are included in the collections of the Tate
    Gallery, London; the Metropolitan Museum of Art,  New York; and the Tokyo
    Museum.
