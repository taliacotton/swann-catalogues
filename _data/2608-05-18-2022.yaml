    book. <br>As a descendant of the Duke of Ancaster, Eleanor Vere Boyle was a
    member of the British peerage and an amateur painter and children's book
    illustrator. As her family looked askance at any one of her class or sex
    participating in the arts, she signed her work "EVB" and so worked within
    relative obscurity. Her husband was the son of the Earl of Cork. She
    specialized in elaborate Pre-Raphaelitesque watercolors for fairy tales. One
    of her most accomplished works was Friedrich Wilhelm Carové's The Story
    Without an End (1868), translated from the German by Sarah Austin.

  TYPESET: >-
    The second book in the "New Basic Readers Program of the Sixties" series
    created by by Scott, Foresman and Company, 1962.<br>The archive comprises
    three main elements: Pencil roughs of the full book consisting of a cover
    illustration and 60 pages (in folded quadrants) of handwritten text and
    sketches (all in the artist's hand) * Fifteen envelopes, one for each story
    in the book, containing preparatory modeling photos of the artist's family,
    typed revision notes from the publisher, sketches and re-worked pages * Two
    mimeographed proof sketchbooks contaning Childress' copious edits, a few
    text revisions, and some reworked illustrations laid into the pages. See
    condition report for breakdown of contents.<br>Provenance: The artist, by
    descent to daughter Nancy, who was the model for the character
    Sally.<br>Perhaps the most famous series of readers for young children, the
    "Dick and Jane readers," was the brainchild of Scott, Foresman
    editors/writers William S. Gray and Zerna Sharp.  Developed in the 1930s,
    their popular primers, which used the "look-see" (i.e. sight-reading)
    method, peaked in the 1950s and taught generations of American school
    children the fundamentals of reading, writing, and verbal skills.  When the
    company sought to update the series in the late 1950s and early `60s, they
    worked with professionals in the fields of child psychology and early
    childhood education to create the texts that used modern pedagogical methods
    and artwork that would reflect contemporary props and story plots to engage
    beginning readers. With an emphasis on visual stimulation and the idea that
    children learn to read pictures before text, SFC hired Childress to create
    the accompanying illustrations that children could relate to and ideally
    spark their joy for reading. His wholesome, joyful imagery for such
    advertising campaigns as Wonder Bread, Campbell's Soup, and Coca-Cola, among
    other traditional brands, made him the ideal illustrator for the series
    .<br>Childress was so enthused by the project and produced several stories
    between 1958 and 1968. He employed his entire family in the venture,  having
    them pose for the illustrations which SFC encouraged, printing all the
    photos he needed for his work. These photographs, which display his
    commitment to honest and realistic poses and expressions, were preserved by
    Childress and his family and are included in this archive, organized by the
    titles of the stories for which they were created. The accompanying full
    pencil roughs lay out the chapters and contain meticulous handwritten text
    beneath his perfectly composed sketches.<br>Childress' contributions were so
    integral that the publishers would entrust him with textual edits that he
    suggested, some examples of which are marked in the proof sketchbooks.
    <br>This archive provides a wonderful and detailed look into the creative
    process of the illustrator who helped shape mid-century American education.

    Group of four preparatory sketches created for the frontispiece of E. B.
    White's "Stuart Little" (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1945). Graphite on
    paper. 400x305 mm; 15¾x12 inches, sheets.  Each initialed "GW" in lower
    margin; one drawing with exact tracing on reverse.<br>Provenance: Estate of
    Garth Williams; Heritage Auctions, 2011; private collection purchased from
    above.<br>This series of drawings shows the evolution of the drawing that
    eventually became the frontispiece illustration for Stuart Little. Two of
    the drawings have notations in pencil by Williams, likely for the approval
    of E. B. White and editor Ursula Nordstrom. One of them reads: "don't think
    he should look amused or worried" with an arrow pointing to Mr. Little.
    Below this is the word "no," probably in White's or Nordstrom's hand.
    Another sheet has the notation "like this best for head," also with an arrow
    pointing to Mr. Little.<br>In a 1983 letter to Peter F. Neumeyer, Garth
    Williams wrote that after much thought, he decided to make Mr. Little look
    like E. B. White and to make Mrs. Little to look like White's wife,
    Katharine. Whether or not White realized this homage is unclear, as Williams
    wrote: "Mr. White passed the frontispiece without comment" (Peter F.
    Neumeyer, The Annotated Charlotte's Web. New York: HarperCollins, 1994, page
    201).

    Float-mounted to silk-covered matte in a handsome Art Nouveau frame
    measuring 29½x23½ inches.<br>Other than a small design for a decorative
    vase, no painting by the great French poster and fine artist Berthon has
    come to market. This charming image featuring a young woman, likely a
    governess, amusing her delighted charges with a brightly colored marionette,
    was likely done for a department or toy store advertisement. The background
    contains a decorative pattern of shuttlecocks, a popular pastime at the turn
    of the century and further establishing the theme of play in the image.

  TYPESET: >-
    Drawing based on the rear cover illustration and thus a likely study for
    Gorey's first published book The Unstrung Harp; or, Mr. Earbrass Writes a
    Novel (New York & Boston: Duell, Sloan, and Pearce/Little, Brown & Co.,
    1953).  Ink and graphite on paper with typed caption along bottom. Roughly
    201x157 mm;  8x6¼ inches (slightly uneven sheet). Unsigned.
    <br>Authenticated by the Edward Gorey Charitable Trust.<br>An early and
    unusal piece by Gorey, drawn on a larger scale and different paper than
    usual. On the published covers, the figures, copied here, are pictured as
    "Mr. Gorey, Mr. Earbrass, and a Knowledgeable Friend," whereas in this
    drawing, the "knowlegeable friend" is Gorey, himself. <br>The Unstrung Harp,
    Gorey's first published work and a fairly autobiographical one at that, was
    unique in that it used a printed typeface rather than hand-lettering, which
    would become a characteristic feature of his work. He did create
    hand-lettering for it when it was released in the compilation Amphigorey,
    1972. As he was still developing his style, the illustrations, while
    reflecting the complexity he was known for, were rendered in a looser line
    and composition than he would hone in following books. This illustration
    shares those same qualities to an exaggeration where the outer edges look
    somewhat rushed and unfinished but still exemplifies a sure and spontaneous
    hand. An early and charmingly personal illustration by Gorey.

  TYPESET: >-
    Acrylic on canvas. 914x711 mm; 36x28 inches. <br>Hane was a highly talented
    and prolific illustrator during the short span of his professional career.
    Though he created hundreds of magazine, book, and album cover designs, he is
    likely best known for the covers of the Collier-Macmillan editions of C.S.
    Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia books and the Surrealist covers for Carlos
    Castaneda's The Teachings of Don Juan and A Separate Reality for Simon &
    Schuster.  This large, surrealist painting created for DeBeers Diamonds is a
    gorgeous example of his work, generally scarce on the market, rendered in a
    rich palette, with moody figures and backgrounds to create a sense of
    mystique, a fantasy world to which one could be transported. Hane was at the
    height of his creative powers when he died as a result of a mugging in
    Central Park, but was recognized by the artistic community with several
    posthumous awards and Philadelphia College of Art, in his home state of
    Pennsylvania, offers an annual Roger T. Hane Memorial Award to the student
    with the year's best illustration portfolio.

    <br>Provenance: Acquired indirectly from the Estate of Norman
    Platnick.<br>Literature: The Lady Seldom Smiles: A Collector's Guide to
    Neysa McMein by Norman I. Platnick. Published by Enchantment Ink,
    2008.<br>Born Marjorie McMein, the artist changed her name to "Neysa" after
    moving to New York City to pursue a brief acting career. She studied at The
    School of The Art Institute of Chicago and at the Art Students League. After
    selling her first drawing to the Boston Star, McMein began illustrating
    covers for The Saturday Evening Post in 1915 where her covers featuring
    glamorous and fashionable young women quickly gained popularity and brought
    her many more commissions for the leading magazines of the day, including
    Collier's, McClure's, Liberty, and Woman's Home Companion. During World War
    I, McMein was commissioned to create propaganda posters for the governments
    of the United States and France, as well as to design fundraising posters
    for the Red Cross and YMCA. From 1923 to 1937, she produced all the covers
    for McCall's. She also created advertisements for leading brands like Lucky
    Strike, Palmolive, and Betty Crocker, for which she produced a portrait of
    the fictional home baker. When magazines began reducing costs by replacing
    expensive commissioned illustrations with the cheaper medium of photography,
    McMein pivoted from her commercial career and primarily painted commissioned
    portraits.<br>McMein was an ardent supporter of women's suffrage and was
    known to be fiercely independent with an active social life, which sometimes
    pushed the boundaries of propriety. She was inducted into the Society of
    Illustrators Hall of Fame in 1984, 35 years after her death.

    With specialities in stained and painted glass, as well as graphic design,
    he taught art through World War I, and later returned to Lavtia where he
    exhibited his own artwork. Influenced by artists such as Beardsley and
    Vallotton, Vidbergs' costume designs and erotic illustrations especially
    evoke the graceful, curvilinear details of Beardsley and the boldness of
    Vallotton's prints. This fasionable, whimsical poster displays Vidbergs'
    indelible sense of graphic patterns, negative space, and composition.

    "Gerda Wegener" in lower right margin. Circa 1920.<br>The Danish illustrator
    and painter Gerda Wegener moved to Paris in 1912 and quickly became known
    for the superb artistry of her fashion and lifestyle illustrations and
    advertisements (see lots 19 and 20) in Vogue, La Vie Parisienne, Fantasion,
    La Guirlande, and many other Parisian magazines. Her style was marked by a
    playful sensuality though her book illustrations and fine art displayed more
    highly erotic, mainly Sapphic themes. Her personal life received scrutiny
    when her spouse and muse, Lili Elbe, also a painter, who went by the name
    Einer Wegener, became the first woman to undero gender confirmation surgery
    and became a critical figure in the LGBTQ community. Elbe stopped painting
    shortly thereafter and eventaully died of complications after a fourth
    surgery. In 2000, a novel based loosely on their lives was published and
    turned into a feature -length film, The Danish Girl in 2015. <br>Wegener's
    work remains among the best of the Art Deco period, especially in light of
    her sucess as a female artist amid her more famous male contemporaries such
    as Barbier, Brunelleschi, Lepape, and Martin.

    Shakespeare's play with music by Prokofiev was orchestrated by Antal Dorati
    and Frederick Delius, and with choreography by Antony Tudor. <br>"Tudor's
    interpretation of the ill-fated love story by William Shakespeare remains
    the only ballet version of Romeo and Juliet presented in one act. One of the
    most shocking memories of Romeo and Juliet is the fact that Tudor could not
    finish this forty-five minute epic by the date of the premiere. A finished
    version was presented four days after the premiere. Of note is the story of
    how the costumes and sets were designed: 'I originally wanted sets and
    costumes by Salvador Dali because I had conceived the décor in terms of Fra
    Angelico and Dali handles those notions very well. However Dali's ideas did
    not harmonize with mine.' Eugene Berman eventually was brought on and he
    designed the scenery and costumes by drawing inspiration from Renaissance
    paintings, notably by Botticelli. The designs were a success with both the
    audience and critics."-from The Ballets of Antony Tudor by Judith

    F. Maibaum Fine Arts; Rosa Esman Gallery (their label with certification by
    Alma Law, Professor of History of Drama, Columbia University, New York);
    private collection, New York. <br>Born to a Belarusian father and Greek
    mother, Exter was one of the greatest set and costume designers of her
    generation.  Her painting studio in Kyiv was a center for Ukraine's artists
    and intelligentsia. She joined the Russian avant-garde and often exhibited
    her work abroad.  As an avowed Cubo-Futurist, she at first embraced the
    Russian Revolution but emigrated to Paris in 1924 where she established
    herself as an important Art Deco artist. While still in Soviet Russia, she
    aligned herself with director Alexander Tairov and Moscow's experimental
    Kamerny Theater. Her radical use of stage space is evident in the last of
    her three Constructivist stage designs for this theater for Romeo and Juliet
    that opened on May 17, 1921.''In both the play and paintings there are
    interpenetrating diagonal networks of bars and wedges; in the play these
    relationships can be read as the visual equivalent to the tangled intrigues
    in this adapted translation of Shakespeare’s tragedy. The different levels
    of the vertical set were transformed into whatever scenic location was
    required by the addition or subtraction of curtains. So Exter showed how, in
    a flash, the outdoor fight scene could become the indoor ball scene" (Ronny
    H. Cohen, "Alexandra Exter's Designs for the Theater," Artforum, Summer

    Sondheim musical in 1957 with West Side Story. Though Hirschfeld had been
    drawing the American Theatre for more than thirty years by then, he went on
    to record the next half-century of Sondheim on Broadway, off-Broadway, and
    in films. Hirschfeld captured almost all of his Broadway shows and few of
    the films he scripted or scored. Sondheim was himself a Hirschfeld
    collector, acquiring show drawings either directly from the artist or
    through his friends and collaborators like Hal Prince. In his last
    interview, just five days before his death, the times included a photo of
    Sondheim with an image of Hirschfeld’s Putting it Together in the
    background. <br>"While the two men were quite different, Hirschfeld would
    have probably agreed with Sondheim’s quote that 'Content Dictates Form; Less
    is More; God Is in the Details — all in the service of Clarity, without
    which nothing else matters.'"--from "Stephen Sondheim: His Career as Seen by

    Pen and ink with blue pencil on Bristol board. 178x572 mm; 7x22½ inches.
    Each signed "Chester Gould" and with King Features Syndicate, Inc. pastedown
    label. <br>Gould was most famous for his Dick Tracy comic strip, which he
    began only two years after this popular but short-lived strip about a feisty
    young lady. Left as a baby on the doorstep of three male artists Barclay,
    Kit, and Jimmy, and their housekeeper, Mother Gale, Nancy was adopted,
    raised, and adored by them. This group of strips focuses on Nancy's
    impending twelfth birthday and her growing curiosity about her birth
    parents. A tender and very gender-role bending strip from Gould's early days
    before he became known for his hard-edged detective hero.
