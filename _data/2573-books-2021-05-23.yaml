    views about the injustice of slavery and his support of the Lincoln
    administration in its conduct of the Civil War was widely known, which is
    why many were shocked and outraged that, when Jefferson Davis had been
    captured after the close of the War and held in prison without trial,
    Greeley advocated for his release (or for a speedy trial). Greeley held that
    constitutional rights are the same for all, including Davis, and moreover
    that showing leniency toward the former Rebels would help reduce resentment
    and the probability of further rebellion.

    formed by executive order the U.S. National Commission on the Causes and

    Commission's tasks was the investigation of the civil rights demonstrations
    taking place in cities across the country, including those surrounding the
    1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. A team of hundreds
    interviewed over 1,000 witnesses to the violence that took place during
    those demonstrations, resulting in the release of the Walker Report on
    December 1 of that year, concluding that nearly all demonstrators were
    intent upon peaceful demonstration and that a small number of police should
    be prosecuted for indiscriminate violence. In September of the following
    year, the spectacular trial of seven protestors charged with conspiracy and
    inciting a riot--the Chicago Seven--gripped the nation's attention. Although
    some were initially convicted, an appeal resulted in the reversal of all
    convictions.

    community in America had been considering ways to achieve an independent
    state for Poland, free of the control of Russia, Prussia, and Austria. In
    January 1917, Colonel Arthur D. Le Pan at the Canadian Officer Training
    School near what is today the University of Toronto started training a group
    of Polish soldiers intending for them to form the beginnings of a Polish
    national army. When the U.S. declared war against Germany in April, I.J.
    Paderewski proposed that a Polish force be assembled as part of the U.S.
    Army; those Poles in the States who had not yet obtained citizenship were
    then recruited for the purpose and sent to Le Pan's training camp across
    Lake Ontario from the officer's school. Paderewski and his wife visited the
    camp on at least one occasion between 1917 and 1918.

    We're a big hit, which is nothing to be sneered at I suppose, but it was the
    bitterest experience I've had yet. The show, under George Abbott's astute
    bungling, was a disaster until the last week in Washington, when Jerry
    Robbins came down to save it. Save it he did, by giving it three or four
    moments of style and an opening number (which I wrote the last weekend
    before we came into New York) which, contrary to Abbott's understanding,
    explained clearly to the audience what the show was about. I don't
    understand how that man got where he has . . . the enormity of his ineptness
    is unbelievable. He's totally humorless (the jokes literally had to be
    explained to him) and without any visible talent for staging or pace . . .
    and of course the critics gave him all the credit for the show. . . . I got
    really blasted. But that's to be expected--it's essentially a musician's
    score (I got wonderfully gratifying letters from [Frank] Loesser, [Harold]
    Arlen, Hugh Martin, etc.) . . . . However, these sour grapes are
    unseemly--the audiences love the show and at the moment we're the hottest
    ticket in town. Zero [Mostel] is still wrong for the show, but the critics
    and public eat him up (a full meal). Davy Burns is marvelous, as is Jack
    Gilford. And so am I.<br><br>". . . As far as raunchy gossip goes, . . . I

    Fitzgerald, Dos Passos, Dorothy Parker and others--visited the tubercular
    child of Gerald and Sara Murphy at a sanatorium in Montana-Vermala,

    editor of The Dial magazine (which had recently closed down permanently),
    responding to charges concerning Parker's article, "The Artist's Reward,"
    profiling Hemingway in the November 30 issue of the New Yorker. In the
    article, Parker writes of an unnamed "gentleman who once occupied the
    editorial chair of a now defunct magazine of culture . . . [who] was shown
    some of Hemingway's work . . . refused it, and pronounced, 'I hear he has

    "You, my two eldest, have written a book after my own heart. You know that;
    for you know that I have thwarted all attempts to separate me from the
    German emigrants and to give me a separate, questionable position among
    them, that I have emphasized my relationship to them, and that for years I
    did so because I did not want the rulers of Germany to hesitate any longer
    to 'expatriate' me too,--as they had already 'expatriated' you and my
    brother. They did not hesitate longer.<br><br>"Your book is a book of
    solidarity on which I then insisted. Let it be a solidarity not alone in
    suffering and in pride, but in guilt as well. German freedom and the Weimar
    republic have been destroyed; we, you and I, are not altogether guiltless in
    that matter--though surely we may disclaim any part or lot in the
    degradation and shame which ensued. Mistakes were made, of omission and
    commission; that we cannot deny. The spiritual leaders of the Republic did
    not err, perhaps, on the side of the spirit; but they did so in the matter
    of leadership and the consciousness of their responsibility. Freedom is
    sometimes compromised . . . . Freedom is complex, it is delicate--far more
    delicate than force. . . . We German intellectuals were new to freedom, we
    were politically very young and inexperienced--as young as you were then in
    actual years.<br><br>". . . Knowing the deep soundness of your natures, I
    have always interpreted the hatred displayed toward you, my children, and
    that toward myself, as a sign . . . of the wicked brainlessness of the
    rising tide of brutality in Germany. Now, in your growing strength . . . I

    made by its very banishment. . . ."<br><br>Published in Erika and Klaus

    Mann is perhaps best known by those outside Germany as a leader of the

    Nazi regime. When Mann read the manuscript of the book written by two of his
    children on the subject of the culture being generated by these exiles,
    Escape to Life, Mann wrote his reactions in a letter to the authors, who

    "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" accomplished by him in holograph</i>
    in black ink on the recto of the portrait frontispiece and differing
    slightly from the published version ("neer" misspelling in line 6, and
    "give" for "gives in line 9). Inscribed on the front flyleaf "For Unade and
    Howard and / Elizabeth Seckerson / from their guest friend / Robert Frost /
    March 15 1939 / Storrs." The "guest friend" mention is a nod to Frost's
    several short stays at the Seckerson's home when in Storrs to give a
    reading. Howard Seckerson started the English Department at the University
    of Connecticut, Storrs, and his wife Unade Seckerson (née Barnes) was the
    daughter of Djuna Barnes' half-brother Duane. We trace a small number of
    inscribed Frost editions featuring this poem sold at auction with one stanza
    or just the last verse in Frost's hand but finding the poem complete as here
    makes this of great significance, further enhanced by an excellent
    provenance.

    thwarted when he was among those blacklisted after he refused to testify in
