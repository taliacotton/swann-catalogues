  DESCRIPT: (INDIA)
  CROSSHEAD: >-
    An album with 60 photographs celebrating the investiture of Maharaja
    Jagatjit Singh of Kapurthala.
  TYPESET: >-
    This album represents one of the most comprehensive photographic depictions
    of a 19th century maharaja and his court. With his titles, riches, affairs,
    and estates, the Maharaja Jagatjit Singh of Kapurthala was internationally
    known as the epitome of Indian royalty. His coronation album includes both
    formal and informal portraits of Jagatjit Singh and his fellow princes, his
    administrators and distinguished guests, including Prince Albert Victor on a
    pig sticking expedition, taken three years before his death. The album
    includes views of Jagatjit Singh’s palaces, private and public buildings,
    and the palace grounds. There are images of Kapurthala’s royal stable, his
    elephants (including his famously enormous state pachyderm), his horses
    (with a striking image of the Maharaja on his favorite steed), his dogs,
    durbars, tennis games, and remarkable images of His Highness’s servants
    pedaling Jagatjit Singh and his chihuahua in a velocipede and paddle boat.
    Included are views of the city market, temples, and a two-panel panorama of
    Kapurthala. Albumen prints, the images measuring approximately 9½x11¾ inches
    (24.1x29.8 cm.), and slightly smaller, and the reverse, mounted recto/verso,
    each with a caption, in ink, on the mount. Oblong leather folio, with the
    gilt-lettered title "Kapurthala;" with a new leather spine replacing the
    cloth spine that had been applied by Maria Brothers in Simla; signed by
    Jagatjit Singh in 1891 on the front free endpaper. 1890

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Jagatjit Singh of Kapurthala created an image of himself as a dashing,
    romantic figure. He became famous in his day for his spectacular gems and
    his secularism. He traveled the world, served as British India’s
    representative to the League of Nations, received 28 Grand Crosses. 


    Believing himself the incarnation of Louis IV, he spoke fluent French, built
    a palace after Versailles, hosted lavish parties in Paris and on the
    Riviera, and added a Spanish dancer and a Czech countess to his harem of
    four. 


    Though it appears that this album was meant to be a souvenir, we have not
    been able to locate another copy (including in the Kapurthala family's
    collection, the Royal Collection, and the India Office Library). 


    Given the quality of the photographs, we propose the photographer may have
    been Lala Deen Dayal who at this time was the Viceroy's official
    photographer.

    signature and notation "From Life Not Enlarged," in ink, "Baby Blossom," in

    Circa 1866
  at-a-glance: ''
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    In the summer of 1865, Cameron began using larger format 15x12-inch glass
    negatives. She embarked upon a series of large-scale, close-up portraits,
    which she saw as a rejection of conventional photography in favor of a less
    precise but more emotionally compelling kind of portraiture. She wrote to
    Henry Cole that she intended this new series to "electrify you with delight
    and startle the world."


    There are no other prints known of this portrait of Alice Keown. She was the
    daughter of Thomas Keown, and Cameron also photographed her sister Elizabeth
    and brother Percy. Alice was not known as Baby Blossom, so it is thought
    that perhaps Cameron took the title from Ida White's recently published
    poem.

    Around 1832 Parisian-born Charles-François Bossu (1813–1879) changed his
    unfortunate last name ("bossu" means hunchback in French) and adopted the
    pseudonym Marville, which also transformed his identity. By 1850 he began
    taking poetic photographs throughout Old Paris, a project that foreshadows
    the work of another great French artist, Eugène Atget.

    Gurney was one of the pioneering practitioners of the daguerreotype process,
    opening the first American photo gallery at 189 Broadway in 1840. His work
    is known for its fine detail, and for a clientele base from New York City's
    elite, building a reputation as the city's leading daguerreotypist. In 1851,
    Gurney founded the American Daguerre Association—the first national
    organization of photographers.


    By the early 1850s, he was housed at 349 Broadway, where he occupied nine
    rooms. In 1858 he built a three-story studio at 707 Broadway, apparently the
    first building constructed for the purpose of photography in the United
    States.


    William Lewis Dayton was the first Republican vice-presidential nominee in
    1856. Although his campaign was unsuccessful, Dayton proved to be a talented
    diplomat in his foreign affairs. Following his vice-presidential campaign,
    Dayton then served as the American ambassador to France. There, he
    successfully worked against the French recognition of the Confederate States
    of America. He was later appointed to Minister of France. Dayton served
    until his death in December of 1864 in Paris, France.

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    This album represents two important milestones: the end of Mathew Brady's
    career as the most renowned American photographer of the 19th century, and
    the birth of what became the Organization of American States. <br><br>The
    American politician James Blaine (1830-1893), best known as the losing
    candidate in the 1884 presidential election, served as Secretary of State
    from 1889 to 1892. Blaine had an expansive vision of the nation's role on
    the international stage, and convening the First International Conference of
    American States was one of his first accomplishments as the nation's top
    diplomat. Held from 20 January to 27 April 1890, it brought together 27
    delegates from 17 nations. A secretariat was established on 14 April which
    evolved into today's Organization of American States. The date is still
    observed as Pan-American Day. <br><br>The work of photographing the
    delegates was given to Mathew B. Brady (1822-1896), revered for his
    pioneering work from 1844 through the Civil War. By 1890, he had gone
    through bankruptcy and was in poor health, just six years away from an
    ignominious death in a hospital charity ward. His most recent major
    commission had been an 1888 album of the members of the 50th Congress. He
    was later hired to produce a similar album of the 1891 Patent Centennial,
    but no examples are known. <br><br>Among the most well-known delegates
    represented here are Blaine, who leads off the album as portrait 1; wagon
    manufacturer Clement Studebaker, #22, and industrialist Andrew Carnegie,
    #25. Among the Latin-American delegates were two future presidents of
    Argentina, Manuel Quintana and Roque Sáenz Peña; and a former president of
    Ecuador, José María Plácido Caamaño. Philippe Hannibal Price of Haiti
    appears second in the volume. Delegates from Peru, Guatemala, Colombia,
    Uruguay, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Brazil, Honduras, Mexico, Bolivia, Venezuela,
    Chile, and El Salvador are also represented. The final image shows the
    Wallach Mansion on Massachusetts Avenue, where the conference was held.

    Ethel Andrews, to whom the mailing envelope is addressed, was an assistant
    to Alfred Stieglitz. She gave this copy of Number 36 to friend of hers in
    the 1960s, from whom the current owners purchased the issue, in 2007. 


    In the early decades of the 20th century, as photography was establishing
    itself as an art form for the amateur snapshooter, Alfred Stieglitz pursued
    the realization of his daring artistic vision as well as popular and
    institutional recognition for his work. Relentless in experimentation,
    reinvention, and creative dexterity, Stieglitz used <i>Camera Work</i> to
    make the American introduction of new writers and artists, as a venue for
    his tireless insistence on photography's rightful place next to these
    tastemakers, and, eventually, a forum for the bold idea that photography was
    uniquely suited to depict modern life. 


    Edward Steichen designed Camera Work's cover, creating a unique Art
    Nouveau-inspired font in white on the magazine's soft gray wrappers, and
    this simple, highly elegant design signaled Stieglitz's intent to his
    audience. Its extravagant photogravures (often printed on delicately
    beautiful Japanese tissue) were hand-tipped into the publication. The high
    standards for the publication were Stieglitz's own for photography, and he
    offered his publication as the gold standard, and as a medium for debate and
    discussion.


    Stieglitz's own imagery, which form the complete set of photogravures in
    this landmark issue, speak to his adoption of so-called "straight
    photography" and transition away from Pictorialism. <i>The Steerge</i>,
    reproduced here for the first time, remains today an icon of the modernist
    sensibility. However, here we also often see him turn to atmospheric
    effects, using smoke and weather to both mask and illuminate the urban
    landscape, effectively both concealing the city's modernity while also
    juxtaposing the new urban environment with the natural environment it
    displaced. Stieglitz, one of New York City's most poetic and muscular
    photographers, captures both the intimacy and the modern isolation of the
    early twentieth-century urban environment.

    In 1968 Robert and Mary Frank donated this print to Saint Ann's School in
    Brooklyn Heights for inclusion in the institution's first fundraising
    auction. It was purchased by Louis and Helen Silverstein, who had solicited
    the donation and were also friends and colleagues of the Franks.


    Louis Silverstein was a groundbreaking art director for the <i>New York
    Times</i>, who, over the course of his long career, would revolutionize the
    appearance and visual language of the newspaper (he became known as the
    godfather of modern newspaper design). Silverstein first encountered Frank's
    work in <i>Fortune</i> magazine, and invited the young photographer to his
    offices in New York. What followed was a sustained and incredibly fruitful
    working relationship between the two which would lead, among other things,
    to the publication <i>New York Is.</i>


    In 1954, Frank applied to the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation
    fellowship. For the following two years, Frank would travel across the
    nation to document American life through photography. The imagery produced
    by the artist during this time is seen as some of the most iconic of its
    time. In his application, Frank wrote that his goal was “to photograph
    freely throughout the United States, using the miniature camera exclusively.
    The making of a broad, voluminous picture record of things American, past
    and present.”


    “I saw a lot of things other people didn’t see,” Frank said. “The eyes were
    always fine and could always find a place of interest and zoom. That’s my
    profession, to look.” In this incongruous image, we see Frank looking at a
    baby crawling next to a jukebox, an item that somehow seems to stand in for

  DESCRIPT: ROBERT FRANK (1924-2019)
  CROSSHEAD: Los Angeles.
  TYPESET: >-
    Silver print, the image measuring 12⅞x8½ inches (32.7x21.6 cm.), the sheet
    14x11 inches (35.6x27.9 cm.), with Frank's signature, in ink, on recto.
    1956; printed 1960s

  FOOTNOTE: >-
    In 1968 Robert and Mary Frank donated this print to Saint Ann's School in
    Brooklyn Heights for inclusion in the institution's first fundraising
    auction. It was purchased by Louis and Helen Silverstein, who had solicited
    the donation and were also friends and colleagues of the Franks.


    Louis Silverstein was a groundbreaking art director for the <i>New York
    Times</i>, who, over the course of his long career, would revolutionize the
    appearance and visual language of the newspaper (he became known as the
    godfather of modern newspaper design). Silverstein first encountered Frank's
    work in <i>Fortune</i> magazine, and invited the young photographer to his
    offices in New York. What followed was a sustained and incredibly fruitful
    working relationship between the two which would lead, among other things,
    to the publication <i>New York Is.</i>


    In 1954, Frank applied to the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation
    fellowship. For the following two years, Frank would travel across the
    nation to document American life through photography. The imagery produced
    by the artist during this time is seen as some of the most iconic of its
    time. In his application, Frank wrote that his goal was “to photograph
    freely throughout the United States, using the miniature camera exclusively.
    The making of a broad, voluminous picture record of things American, past
    and present.”


    Frank’s masterful understanding of visual irony is made clear in this 1956
    photograph of Los Angeles. The linear, angular structure of the cityscape,
    in addition to the contrasty arrow, both direct our attention in multiple
    ways. On one level, we are drawn vertically: the street, sidewalk and
    building each align into thirds. On the other, we are drawn horizontally,
    following the passerby. This image provokes a near dolly zoom effect on the
    viewer.

    This early print was originally acquired directly from Brett Weston by his
    longtime friend, photographer Robert Byers in the 1970s. At Byers' request,
    the print was placed on a modern mount and then signed and dated by Weston
    on its new mount. This print is accompanied by a sheet of paper with title
    and date in Byers' hand in pencil.


    The only other known print of this image is in the Whitney Museum collection
    and is not mounted.

    1974<br><br>This set is accompanied by a Polaroid portrait of Carrey by
    Walker Evans. Polaroid, the image measuring3⅛ inches (7.9 cm.) square, the
    sheet 4¼x3½ inches (10.7x8.8 cm.). 1974
  at-a-glance: ''
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    The set offered here is one of three existing examples, one of which is in
    the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The last set
    (the original Polaroids) remains in the collection of the artist. Walker
    Evans' portrait of Carrey is also in the collection of the Metropolitan
    Museum.


    In the summer of 1974, Evans was working to finish a book on Main Street,
    USA as seen through vintage postcards. Carrey, a photographer herself, had
    become known as someone who could wrangle artists and get results. Carrey's
    introductory text and the photographs document their time together,
    including trips to the beach, meals, everyday details of Evans' home and
    life (including his bills, matches, clothing, and more), and their
    encounters as they lived and worked side by side. 


    The images are an intimate portrait of one of the most influential
    photographers of the century and are delightful and revealing in their
    detail. Their articulate, descriptive qualities nod to Evans' own elegant
    and direct style, and the portraits of the photographer offer a rare glimpse
    of the charismatic and elusive man himself.
