  DESCRIPT: Hancock, John
  CROSSHEAD: Partly-printed Document Signed, as President of the Continental Congress
  TYPESET: Uncommon Privateer Commission (American Revolution). Partly-printed Document
    Signed, as President of the Continental Congress, granting to John Ord, commander
    of the schooner Security, "Licence and Authority . . . to attack, seize, and take
    the Ships and other Vessels belonging to the Inhabitants of Great-Britain . .
    . to some convenient Ports in the . . . Colonies . . . ." Philadelphia, 6 February
    1777
  FOOTNOTE: 'At the start of the Revolution, the military might of the British Navy
    was unmatched, numbering at over 200 vessels, while the Continental Navy began
    with fewer than 30. To win victory at sea, the fledgling government commissioned
    over 1,500 privateer vessels over the course of the War. A "letter of marque"
    issued by the Continental Congress, such as the one in this lot, offered a private
    ship owner the opportunity to simultaneously fulfill her duty to the new nation
    and exercise her enterprising spirit (since her crew often divided the spoils
    of seized enemy vessels). The life of a privateer, however, was dangerous: thousands
    were captured and neglected in prison ships anchored near the shores of New York
    City. Over 10,000 privateers and other American patriots who died of starvation
    or disease aboard these ships were hastily buried on the shore of the present
    day Brooklyn Navy Yard. Today, these remains are located in a vault below the
    Prison Ship Martyrs Monument in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn.'
  at-a-glance: 8x13 inches; encapsulated (but removable), few separations at folds
    repaired on verso, faint scattered soiling; matted and framed.

  CROSSHEAD: " Autograph Letter Signed, as Senator, to President James K. Polk"
  TYPESET: TO PRESIDENT POLK DIX, JOHN A. Autograph Letter Signed, as Senator, to
    President James K. Polk, recommending the son of Anthony James Bleecker [John
    V.B. Bleecker] for the position of Purser in the Navy. Washington, 21 November
    1845
  FOOTNOTE: '"I rec''d a letter last evening from Mr. A[nthony] J[ames] Bleecker relative
    to his son, whose name is before you as a candidate for the app''t of Purser in
    the Navy. He understands a vacancy has occurred through the removal of Mr. Todd
    Young. . . . I presume he would receive the support of most, if not all, the democratic
    members of Congress from the State of N.Y. . . . . ". . . [M]y regard for his
    father, who is one of the most estimable citizens, has induced me to make this
    statement . . . . [T]he appointment of his son would, I am confident, be quite
    satisfactory to him & at the same time w''d highly gratify his . . . friends in
    N.Y." John Van Benthuysen Bleecker (1825-1864) was commissioned Purser in the
    Navy on January 16, 1847; he served as paymaster of the Mississippi squadron on
    June 8, 1864, at which time he was suffering from typhoid fever. The illness worsened,
    and on November 8, at home in New York City, he died.'
