  at-a-glance: "Cast bronze, with a dark brown patina. \n\n558x235x130 mm; \n22x9

  TYPESET: 'Quo Vadis or "Where are you going?" in Latin was first a 1895 popular
    historical novel written by Henryk Sienkiewicz in Polish entitled Quo Vadis: A
    Narrative of the Time of Nero. Barthé was apparently inspired by actor Robert
    Taylor''s masculine presence and performance as Nero in the same-titled 1951 Hollywood
    movie adaptation. This muscular bronze displays a "Charles Atlas-like" physique.
    We have found no other examples of this scarce and fine cast.'

- DESCRIPT: Ronald Joseph (1910 - 1992)
  CROSSHEAD: Untitled (Family at the Table)
  at-a-glance: Oil and enamel on a thick wood panel, circa 1940. 565x406 mm; 22 1/4x16
    inches. Signed in oil, verso.
  TYPESET: |-
    This striking, modernist painting is one of the earliest works by Ronald Joseph that we have located. Ronald Joseph was a student at the Harlem Community Art Center in 1939, where he studied lithography under Reva Helfond, befriended Robert Blackburn and later taught. Displaying the apparent influence of Matisse and Picasso, Joseph's early oil paintings were more influenced by European sources than many of his contemporaries who instead focused on social realism.

    A native of St. Kitts in the British West Indies, Ronald Joseph moved to New York as a child. His student works were included in an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and he studied at the Ethical Culture School, Fieldston School and Pratt Institute. He worked in the mural section of the Federal Art Project of the WPA, and was a representative of the Harlem Artists' Guild to the New York World's Fair (1939-1940). After service in the Army Air Corps, Joseph was awarded a Rosenwald Fellowship in 1948. The funds allowed him to live and work abroad--first in Peru, then Paris, before settling in Brussels. Two of his works from this Rosenwald period are included in the 2009-10 traveling museum exhibition, A Force for Change: African American Art and the Julius Rosenwald Fund.

    Gouache, watercolor and ink on cream wove paper, 1942.

    533x737 mm; 21x29 inches (image). 587x737 mm; 23x31 inches (sheet)

    Signed and dated in gouache, lower right. Titled in pencil, lower left, in the margin
  TYPESET: |-
    This striking modernist painting by Jacob Lawrence is an extremely scarce example from a series that the artist never completed on African-American life in the rural South. It is one of only half a dozen recorded paintings from this early of paintings that are known today. Patricia Hills in her recent Jacob Lawrence biography writes how Lawrence intended to paint a series on the rural life of African-Americans over a six month period. After finishing the The Legend of John Brown series in December of 1941 in New Orleans, Lawrence and his wife Gwendolyn Knight left for Virginia in February of the following year. With plans to embark on a six month series of painting, they moved to Lenexa, a small rural community thirty miles from Richmond, where they stayed with relatives. That spring Lawrence sent other paintings including Firewood and Drawing Water to the Downtown Gallery in New York.

    Cutting Logs #51 is most closely related in subject matter and technique to Firewood #55, in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC. Both include various water-based media on paper, and the numbering with the title. The number is a recent inclusion by the Smithsonian American Art Museum - not included at the time of the publishing of the 2000 catalogue raisonné. Other known paintings from the 1942 series are Trees, 1942, now in the collection of Howard University Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, and The Plowman (Spring Plowing), gouache and tempera on board, 1942. Only two other gouache paintings from the series are recorded in Nesbett/DuBois - both are listed as "location unknown".

    This lot will be accompanied by a letter of opinion from Peter Nesbett, co-author with Michelle DuBois of Jacob Lawrence: Paintings, Drawings and Murals (1935 - 1999), A Catalogue Raisonné, published in 2000. Hills pp. 143-145; Nesbett/DuBois pp. 63-65.

  CROSSHEAD: Partly-printed Document Signed, as President of the Continental Congress
  TYPESET: Uncommon Privateer Commission (American Revolution). Partly-printed Document
    Signed, as President of the Continental Congress, granting to John Ord, commander
    of the schooner Security, "Licence and Authority . . . to attack, seize, and take
    the Ships and other Vessels belonging to the Inhabitants of Great-Britain . .
    . to some convenient Ports in the . . . Colonies . . . ." Philadelphia, 6 February
    1777
  FOOTNOTE: 'At the start of the Revolution, the military might of the British Navy
    was unmatched, numbering at over 200 vessels, while the Continental Navy began
    with fewer than 30. To win victory at sea, the fledgling government commissioned
    over 1,500 privateer vessels over the course of the War. A "letter of marque"
    issued by the Continental Congress, such as the one in this lot, offered a private
    ship owner the opportunity to simultaneously fulfill her duty to the new nation
    and exercise her enterprising spirit (since her crew often divided the spoils
    of seized enemy vessels). The life of a privateer, however, was dangerous: thousands
    were captured and neglected in prison ships anchored near the shores of New York
    City. Over 10,000 privateers and other American patriots who died of starvation
    or disease aboard these ships were hastily buried on the shore of the present
    day Brooklyn Navy Yard. Today, these remains are located in a vault below the
    Prison Ship Martyrs Monument in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn.'

    1845
  FOOTNOTE: '"I rec''d a letter last evening from Mr. A[nthony] J[ames] Bleecker relative
    to his son, whose name is before you as a candidate for the app''t of Purser in
    the Navy. He understands a vacancy has occurred through the removal of Mr. Todd

    statement . . . . [T]he appointment of his son would, I am confident, be quite
    satisfactory to him & at the same time w''d highly gratify his . . . friends in
    N.Y." John Van Benthuysen Bleecker (1825-1864) was commissioned Purser in the
    Navy on January 16, 1847; he served as paymaster of the Mississippi squadron on
    June 8, 1864, at which time he was suffering from typhoid fever. The illness worsened,
    and on November 8, at home in New York City, he died.'
