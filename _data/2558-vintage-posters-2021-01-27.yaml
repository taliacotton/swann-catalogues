    the entire right side available for the printer''s text. "The most striking thing
    about Beardsley''s work, and the source of its immediate fame, is the intense,
    erotic (or better, narcissistic) atmosphere it exudes. Once the shock of recognition
    passes, it can be seen that Beardsley was an incredibly assured draughtsman and
    a perversely inventive designer" (Word & Image p. 18). This elegant, reclining
    woman with a low-cut dress (made more modest with a brooch) is certainly an unexpected
    image to see promoting the sale of children''s books. In La Plume''s 1899 Album
    d''Affiches et d''Estampes, only the image was offered for sale. It is rare to
    find the complete poster with the text. DFP-I 5, Reims 1348, The Poster no. 11.'

    Smithers, a libertine, book dealer and publisher of erotica, founded the magazine
    Savoy in 1896. For his principle illustrator, he employed Beardsley, who had recently
    lost his position at the Yellow Book due to intense criticism of his mores. In
    Victorian England, such a publication did not last long - only 8 issues were published.
    Beardsley designed all the covers and numerous illustrations for the articles,
    as well as some stories himself. This image, referred to by Beardsley as a ''posterette,''
    was his design for the cover of the last issue, and after the magazine''s demise,
    it became the cover for the complete three-volume set of Savoy.'

    century in a sensuous shiver" (Rickards p. 36). "He so far despised the society
    that suffered him that he allowed his mockery to invade his work; more often than
    not his assignments in illustration and decoration carried him off in flights
    of irrelevant rudery; he was compulsive, abstruse, and rapturously sick" (ibid).

    in 1862 (in what is now the Czech Republic) on the principle that physical fitness
    was an important part of a person''s well-being. Sokol members would gather every
    four years at massive Slets (assemblies) to perform physical drills and gymnastics
    to which the public was always invited. Aside from exercise, the Sokol movement
    was also a hotbed for nationalist development; the movement spread across Moravia
    and Slovenia, where the first Sokol event was held in 1863, and eventually spread
    across the Austro-Hungarian empire to encompass events in the Croatian and Serbian
    territories as well. This poster promotes the third Slovenian Sokol Slet, in Ljubljana.
    As Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated barely two months before this exhibition
    was supposed to take place, and war declared in July 1914, it is unclear whether
    or not the event occurred. The wonderfully-colored and archly Art Nouveau image
    depicts a young athlete in his physical prime, standing in a field full of flowers,
    surrounded by falcons (which is the literal translation of Sokol), with the Ljubljana
    Castle in the distance. Note the impressive floral ornamentation and the two Sokol
    logos in the bottom corners of the design. Rare.'

    Sandreuter. A Swiss painter (who also designed several posters), Sandreuter''s
    work was inspired by Greek mythology and his images are filled with allegorical
    figures in classical poses. To announce this upcoming Song Festival, Mangold combines
    Secessionist design elements and mythology. Arion, the Greek poet who was saved
    by a dolphin, is depicted in Lake Constance swimming toward Zurich. Soon after
    this poster was designed, Mangold began working with the inimitable Swiss printing
    house of Wolfensberger. He quickly abandoned his symbolic approach and naturalist
    renderings, began using flat colors, and became one of the pioneers of the modern
    Swiss poster art. Mangold 42, Swiss Art Nouveau 80.'

    publishing company in 1889, designing sheet music covers for operas. Shortly thereafter,
    he became art director of the firm and began to design posters. Poster artists
    such as Dudovich, Mauzan and Metlicovitz worked under Hohenstein, and their posters
    reflect his influence as one of the masters of the Golden Age of Italian posters,
    "from obvious stylistic floral influences of French Art Nouveau and the German
    Jugendstil" (Manifesti Italiano, p. 114). Hohenstein was invited to work outside
    of Italy, in France as well as Belgium, where he designed at least two posters
    printed by the Belgian printing house J.L. Goffart. The Liberty Style at the turn
    of the century was triumphant in Italy, while the fascination for posters had
    begun to wane in France. Here, he advertises the innovations of Félix Marmonier,
    a famed inventor who created wine presses and equipment in the American style.'

    creases and abrasions in margins and image and along vertical and horizontal folds.
    Mounted on Japan.<br><br>Chéret is unanimously considered to be the father of
    the poster. His first recorded attempt at poster art was in 1858 for Offenbach''s
    Orfée aux Enfers. By present day standards, the result was a dark, messy poster
    with clumsy color usage, but in its day it was a revolution. Over the next thirty
    years Chéret perfected the technique of mixing colors, and simplifying his layouts.
    He also may be the first artist to ever use sexuality to sell products; in most
    of his posters he would depict beautiful, care-free, irresistible and jubilant
    women. They became so popular with the French public, that they were referred
    to as Chérettes. In 1889, with this poster for the opening of the Moulin Rouge,
    Chéret (at the age of 53) reached his stylistic maturity. With three decades of
    experience in the field, he had resolved and refined all color and composition
    issues and emerged as a truly outstanding talent who created masterpiece upon
    masterpiece. For the next decade, he produced some of the most vivid and colorful
    posters ever seen, and was an inspiration to a whole generation of artists, advertisers
    and consumers. This poster contains all of the life and spirit that were a hallmark
    of his work. In the foreground, a Chérette sits on a donkey; behind her is the
    landmark red windmill, after which the concert hall was named, as well as charming
    girls in gray and black, also on donkeys; the figures are positioned throughout
    the image as if whirling in the windmill''s blades. Maindron 253, Cheret 395,

    by the best poster artists. Grasset''s panels began in small format with two plates
    for L''Estampe Originale. By 1896, he was working on a series of ten full-size
    panels (Estampes Decoratives) for his printer, Malherbe. In these panels, Grasset
    used representations of women and nature to express states of mind and moods.
    The influence of Japanese prints is clear, including the use of flat colors and
    broad outlining. Unlike Mucha''s sensual approach, Grasset depicted his women
    in their static poses, resulting in a fascinating, hypnotizing effect. Meditation
    is arguably Grasset''s best panel, as the image of a woman lost in her thoughts
    in the silence of nature so perfectly reflects Grasset''s style. The series was
    acclaimed in 1897 at the Libre Esthetique in Brussels and then at the first Secession
    Exhibition in Vienna. Rare. This is the only copy on silk that we have seen. Arwas
    p. 71, Murray Robertson p. 126.'

    there. In 1897, an aggressive entrepreneur "attempted an outright takeover of
    the highly flourishing, but limited world of small cabaret owners. At great expense,
    he built a spacious theatre in the garden next to the Elysée Montmartre and hired
    away the best cabaret singers [from the area''s other smaller venues]" (Grün p.
    29). Grün was commissioned to design a poster for the Trianon''s opening that
    showed a gallery of all the big names and stars who would be performing there.
    Grün also inserted his own portrait, at the far right. The poster is a rare document,
    perhaps the only one on which all of the major stars of the Montmartre cabarets,
    at the height of their popularity, appear together. Grün p. 29, DFP-II 448, Meisterplakate

    production of Medee advertised here was a contemporary adaptation of a play originally
    written by Euripides. A classic, violent Greek tragedy about the warrior Jason,
    the play begins when he returns home from his quest for the Golden Fleece, bringing
    with him Medea. When he falls in love with another woman, Medea, "driven by a
    pagan code of honor and her own dark passions . . . conceives a terrible vengeance
    of gothic cruelty: she kills Jason''s father, her own two children, and his new
    mistress, so that he would have to go through life deprived of everything he loved"
    (Rennert / Weill p. 208). The somber and tragic image depicts a glimpse of the
    slaughter, with Medea, a mad look in her eyes, standing with a bloody dagger over
    one of her victims. "Mucha''s exquisite design uses Medea''s arm and the dagger
    as a giant exclamation point, emphasized by the look of stark horror on her face
    as she exacts her gothic revenge. It is one of [Mucha''s] most powerful posters"
    (Lendl p. 53). "It carries all the signs of Mucha''s masterpieces in composition
    and color as well as the decorative certainty with which he left the bottom two-thirds
    of the background white" (Spirit of Art Nouveau p. 151). The composition is organized
    vertically with Mucha''s trademark "halo" behind the actress'' head, and lettering
    designed in the style of mosaic to evoke the story''s origin in ancient Greece.
    Sarah Bernhardt was so enamored with the snake bracelet that Mucha depicted adorning
    her arm that she actually had one made by Fouquet for her to wear. Rennert / Weill

    whose incredible success was largely attributed to her charms and the shrewd way
    in which she applied them to her pursuits. Both Mucha and the author of the play
    promoted by this poster, Kassa, (a commercial disappointment, despite the wonderful
    poster) were both so taken with her that they completed their work without compensation.
    For this poster, one of the few that Mucha designed while living in America from
    1904-1912, the artist is clearly harkening back to his poster designs for Sarah
    Bernhardt from earlier in his career, as the tall format of the poster, the drape
    of the gown, the halo behind the actress'' head and the crown of flowers are all
    reminiscent of his work in the late 1890s. Mucha had clearly lost nothing of his
    ability to design a great theater poster (although one cannot help questioning
    the choice of blue-green for the actress'' skin tone). Curiously, the title of
    the production itself, appears nowhere on the image. The poster, printed by Strobridge,
    is signed "from a design by Mucha;" most likely had the artist been on the press,
    he would have corrected this detail. Rennert / Weill 94, Lendl p. 266, Brno 56,

    in Rome, received his artistic training at the famed Italian printing house of
    Ricordi, and then moved to Paris where he achieved instant success by participating
    in the second exhibition at Siegfried Bing''s gallery L''Art Nouveau, for which
    he designed Le Calendrier Fantastique. His work "explores and crosses the influences
    of Byzantium, Antiquity, symbolism and occultism" (Art Nouveau p. 121). Orazi
    went on to design this, one of his most famous posters for Bing''s competitor,
    Julius Meyer-Graefe, who opened up La Maison Moderne in 1898. Meyer-Graefe had
    spent time with the avant-garde artistic community in Berlin (he had helped establish
    the influential magazine Pan) before he came to Paris and opened up his store
    dedicated to Art Nouveau finery of the day, including pottery, glass, lamps and
    jewelry. He employed top notch designers like Van de Velde to help him with his
    merchandise and called on some top poster designers, like Orazi and Maurice Biais,
    to create devise his advertising. This image highlights not only the extreme elegance
    of the women who frequented the store, but specifically draws attention to many
    of the fine items that were for sale, including the furniture, jewelry and bibelots.
    Bertrand Mothes, in his paper, "La Maison Moderne de Julius Meyer-Graefe" helps
    us identify these objects: "an inkwell bearing a bronze figure of Alexander Carpenter
    on a base designed by [Maurice] Dufrêne and made of flamed sandstone by Adrien
    Dalpayrat, an armchair by Van de Velde, a bronze lamp by Gustave Gurschner, a
    vase by Dufrêne and Dalpayrat and a monkey figurine by Joseph Mendes da Costa."
    Perhaps more importantly, Mothes identifies the glamourous and impeccably coiffed
    and outfitted patron as "the famous dancer Cléo de Mérode, who, like a muse, lends
    her image to the gallery" (http://hicsa.univ-paris1.fr/documents/file/4-Mothes-Maison%20moderne.pdf,
    p. 17). Note that Orazi also incorporates the store''s stylized "MM" logo, designed
    by Georges Lemmen. In addition to this rare and important poster, Orazi himself
    designed some items to be sold in the store. DFP-II 676, Weill 51, Art Nouveau

    of the more important Belgian painters of the period. When Les XX dissolved in
    1893, it transformed into another group called La Libre Esthétique, with which
    van Rysselberghe was also very active. "Van Rysselberghe exerted a positive force
    for the revitalization of the decorative arts at the turn of the century, but
    his posters are not numerous; those he created for La Libre Esthétique are unquestionably
    the finest. The elegant female figures of his posters, very knowingly placed on

    red-orange against their greenish or bluish complementaries. The text is beautifully

    fin-de-siecle Music Hall scene. She and other glamorous and sexy stars such as
    Caroline Otero, Emilienne d''Alencon and Cléo de Mérode were the objects of desire
    of royalty, industrialists and millionaires. Men of rank would fight (often using
    diamonds as weapons) to have the privilege of being seen in the company of these
    women at Maxim''s or driving in the Bois de Boulogne. In order to keep themselves
    in the public eye, and keep the public''s lascivious interest high, these actresses
    regularly performed in the best music halls. Shows were custom-written to highlight
    their (often limited) talent, and Feminissima most certainly fell into that category.
    In the years after the turn-of-the-century, Redon became one of the most prolific
    poster artists working for the Paris music halls. He specialized in sexy, suggestive
    scenes. Here, in what is arguably his best image, he shows the star, in all of
    her sensuous glory, surrounded by roses. Presumably the management of the Casino
    de Paris had a special relationship with the censors, as breasts and nipples were
    otherwise strictly forbidden on posters. "The warm and sensuous atmosphere of
    the poster, and the very feminine forms unveiled for the first time in Paris attracted
    a big crowd (probably disappointed by the little freedom authorized on stage!)
    to the Casino" (Folies- Bergere p. 10). Folies-Bergere 51.'

    Some people have suggested that Lautrec had fallen in love with her, which would

    painting and design six lithographs (Adriani 110-115). This is by far the best
    image from that series and the only one in color. Lautrec depicts her bowing after
    an extravagant Spanish dance that fascinated him. To render her wild attire and
    hairdo, he uses eight colors with chalk, ink with brush and a spraying/splatter
    technique. As Adriani notes, "no other lithograph is printed with such wealth
    of subtle color combinations and none embodies, as this does, the opulent decoration
    of an age moving towards its close." This is the fourth state of four, from the

    earliest supporters. One year after Lautrec designed his first poster for the
    Moulin Rouge, Bruant recognized the potential that such potent artwork could have
    for his own career. He "appreciated the sensation it had caused and recognized
    it as a watershed in marketing a personality and the experience of Montmartre"
    (Montmartre p. 92). The success of their first work (which Bruant had to force
    on the manager of the Ambassadeurs as he considered it too vulgar) led to many
    more commissions. This is Lautrec''s third poster for the performer. It is "his
    sparest design for Bruant, with the performer turning his back to the viewer and
    glancing over his left shoulder, to reveal his face in profile. Now reduced to
    a few elemental shapes, this forceful hieroglyph served as Bruant''s logo in a
    variety of formats" (ibid p. 93). The broad strokes, flat colors, detailed representation
    of the singer''s face, and the implied arrogance of the performer who would turn
    his back on his public all served to make this an iconic image. The poster originally
    appeared without text; when the second edition with text was printed ("Aristide
    Bruant dans son Cabaret,") it was done so by a different printer, Edward Ancourt.

    machines became so ubiquitous that a court ordered them to give the name back
    to the public out of "common necessity." Roubille, a key member of the Salon des
    Humoristes, was an illustrator for many of Paris'' turn-of-the-century magazines
    for whom he contributed rather radical illustrations. His signature style, with

    the expansive fairgrounds in Roubaix, illuminated by a Farman biplane overhead.
    As a city whose textile manufacturing prowess had greatly prospered from the industrial
    revolution, Roubaix was eager to hold a World''s Fair in 1911 to help further
    establish its status and reputation in the eyes of the world. Held in the city''s
    Barbieux Park from April until November, the exposition contained: palaces of
    decorative art, industry, textiles and machines; pavilions from Argentina, Australia,
    Belgium, New Zealand, Chile and the Netherlands; a Colonial section, a Sengalese
    village, a casino, stadium and restaurants. Aviation, still in its infancy, also
    played a big role in the exposition. A small airfield was constructed near the
    fairgrounds and the first flying demonstration there took place on June 4th; on
    June 12th, assembled aviators flew over the city and the exposition grounds. Roubaix
    was also on the five-stage European flying circuit, encompassing a 15-day race
    through five cities - on June 26th the Roubaix-Brussels stage was held. Ironically,
    a few years after this successful event, the First World War broke out, after
    which Roubaix lost its foothold as the economic superpower of Northern France.

    In 1917, he went to work for Salabert, the music publishers, and during his seven-year
    tenure with the company, he designed over 2000 different sheet music covers. He
    also worked as an adviser for the printer Devambez in 1926, and from 1936, served
    as Associate Director of Advertising for the publisher Perceval. Throughout this
    busy career, he also found time to produce many posters, all of which were executed
    with an impressive Art Deco flair. This poster is one of the great pre-war Art
    Deco Air France images, in which a personification of the airlines rises out of
    a plane, the round Air France logo in her hands echoed by the circles of the propellers
    and the moon in the sky. Air France p. 12.'

    everyday situations that is repeated in Henningsen''s most famous poster of the
    sweaty and thirsty Tuborg man. The poster was made in connection with a competition
    for a "decorative advertising poster," which Tuborg printed in 1900. Although
    it was another painter who ran away with the 1st prize, it was Erik Henningsen''s

    of Halley''s Comet in 1910 caused quite an uproar around the world. The wine distributors
    Dondena & Sons, in Milan, took advantage of Italy''s general unease with the cosmic
    appearance and had Aldo Mazza to create an image of a comet in whose tail were
    the words "mineral water." According to that poster, the populace could "save
    themselves" by drinking wine. That same year, Dondena applied for a trademark
    for their company featuring a star enclosed in the letter "D." This poster is
    a glorious allegory of Italian wines, in the figure of a woman emerging from grape-ladened
    vines, wrapped in Italy''s tri-color flag and holding aloft the company''s logo.
    Mazza began his artistic career as a caricaturist and book illustrator. By 1900,
    he had begun to design posters and worked with a variety of different clients
    to advertise sporting events, the Mele department store, and numerous publications

    that "opens your appetite," Cassandre depicts it, quite literally, as a key. The
    spirit itself appears as a stream of stars infusing the body. Alain Weill explains
    that the background, "never seen before, almost kinetic, shows that Cassandre
    was certainly interested in the study of retinal sensations" (Cassandre / Weill
    p. 126). The poster and image were so popular that they were reused in 1935, virtually

    Paper. Framed.<br><br>"In the beginning was the Matterhorn" (Schweiz p. 50). The
    extraordinary contours of this legendary mountain have appeared in countless posters.
    Many Art Nouveau artists depicted the mountain, and their images reflect the realistic,
    academic representations that were popular at the time. Cardinaux''s image of
    the dawn-drenched Matterhorn, exceptional and revolutionary in its design, smashed
    the old mold. Pure, bold, simple and strong, this poster adapts the style of the
    German Sachsplakat (Object Poster) from before the First World War, and presages
    the Swiss Realism of the early 1920s. "For the first time a graphic approach was
    taken to the problem posed by a poster" (Weill p. 122). "The Swiss poster can
    be said to have been born with the creation of the Zermatt" (ibid). "The poster
    stands out above the common ruck [the typical Swiss poster of the time] just as
    the mountain soars above the landscape" (Schweiz p. 52). It is the first and perhaps
    the finest object poster within the travel poster genre. Cardinaux 14, Weill p.

    games were held in Chamonix. One year later, "these successful Games were retrospectively
    recognized at the [International Olympic Committee] Congress in Prague as the
    first Olympic Winter Games" (Olympics p. 35). The decision to hold these winter
    games came in 1921, and "triggered a period of frenzied construction as rail and
    road links and hotel development opened up the area to international tourism"
    (Ibid p. 33). This is one of five official posters for these winter games, all
    of which were published by the PLM Railway, rather than by the Olympic Committee.
    They were all issued with text variants, sometimes promoting the Olympic Games
    and sometimes just promoting winter activities in the area itself. A variation
    of this image exists with the additional text "Sports D''Hiver à l''Occasion de

    Ernst Keller at the Kunstgewerbeschule, Zurich. He served as Art Director for
    the famed Alpine resort of St. Moritz from 1932-38. "''My job,'' he states, ''was
    to bring people to St. Moritz. I knew that if I did abstract designs most people
    would not understand and so would not be motivated. I had to create an atmosphere
    that gives one the desire to breathe fresh air, soak up warm sun and ski. So I
    knew I must have color.'' His decision to apply bright colors with an airbrush
    to his inventive photomontages was concurrent with Herbert Matter''s now iconographic
    Swiss tourism posters" (Heller, AIGA, 1987). It was a "revolutionary, identity
    campaign. As Herdeg notes, ''I was heading up a corporate design program without
    knowing that such a thing existed.'' . . . this was certainly the first time a
    health resort ever tried to do ''corporate design.'' Herdeg created a memorable
    campaign based on a delightful trademark of a brightly shining sun which, to his
    credit, is still used today. And which he proudly had carved onto a ring that
    he always wears" (ibid.). Herdeg was also the founder of Graphis, the influential
    graphic design magazine.'

    was a teacher at Detroit''s School of Applied Art who is known to have designed
    one poster during the First World War and several posters for the North German
    Lloyd shipping company in 1914. Sesser beat out over 80 artists in a competition
    to design a Centennial poster for Illinois. His "design became familiar to the
    people of the State as the Centennial poster. The Centennial Commission reproduced
    it in color and in various sizes, from the full-size poster down to the "sticker"
    size to be used on letters and packages and widely distributed" (Blue Book of
    the State Of Illinois, 1919-1920, p. 320). The Official Report of the Centennial
    Commission explains the design, "A Pioneer with a flint-lock musket. Kneels in
    reverence to the United States Flag. The present State House of Illinois is in
    the background showing the progress of the century. Above the head of the pioneer
    appears the dates ''1818-1918'' and twenty stars, representing the twenty states
    admitted before Illinois. On a line below in the center, the new star, Illinois,
    appears" (Ibid. p. 416). The words at the bottom are from a song written by Civil
    War veteran Charles Chamberlin, composed as part of Chicago’s bid to the 1893
    World''s Columbian Exposition (where it was ultimately held). In 1925, seven years
    after the state''s Centennial, the song was made the official Illinois state song.

    by the time he was sixteen. However, it wasn''t until after he had spent five
    years studying at the Académie Julian in Paris that he matured into a full-fledged
    illustrator. "His first [Saturday Evening] Post cover was done in 1899, and he
    did well over 300 more during the next 40 years . . . His advertising illustrations
    made his clients famous. The Arrow Collar Man was a byword for the debonair, handsome
    male, and women wrote thousands of love letters to him" (The Illustrator in America,
    p. 150). Here, in a tableau that could be straight out of a modern-day fashion
    advertisement, one of his chiseled, dashing young men, with oars on his shoulder,
    stares out at the viewer with the confident assurance of youth. The young lady,
    fashionable herself behind the wheel of a sports car and beneath a stylish hat,
    seems to be looking out as well while slyly gazing at her companion in a smitten
