But the Gentlemen in the Delegation conform so generally in Sentiment with each other & with those Interests which I particularly respect that I have the less Concern on that Head.

    In May 1851, at a meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society, Douglass shocked his fellow abolitionists by declaring that he had come to recognize that the U.S. Constitution--properly understood--is incompatible with slavery, and consequently, that he would henceforth advocate to bring about that understanding in people and to support the political institutions that are founded on that document. This was shocking, because the Garrisonians believed that the Constitution and related institutions were irredeemably poisoned, and that participation in the political system could only serve to entrench slavery further. This marked not only a turning point in Douglass's career, but also a significant division in the American abolitionist movement generally. A few months prior to the writing of this letter, Douglass had merged his North Star paper with the Liberty Party Paper to form Frederick Douglass' Paper, permanently leaving behind his association with Garrisonian abolitionism.

    "I have known Miss Jones, the Lady superintendent of St John's House, for 7 years--and have been very intimate with her for the last 4--I consider that she has done the greatest work (in charity) which has ever been done in England, by bringing together a religious Society (St. John's Ho:) in joint management with a Secular Institution (King's Coll. Hosp.) the first time you will observe this has ever been done in this country. I consider her as far as possible therefore from those Religious Societies instituted for their own salvation. At Paris you continually see the large secular Hospitals nursed by Religious Orders. King's Coll. Hosp., as far as I am aware, is the only one in London. . . .
    "I consider Miss Jones the best Christian trainer of Nurses I have ever known in any country; and certainly one of the most 'upright' persons I know. . . .
    "As to 'vows,' Miss Jones' laxity is all the other way. I never would be bothered as she allows herself to be, with 'Sisters' coming in for 3 months and going away for 9. Two of her 'sisters' married--no great proof of 'vows.'
    "As for Miss Jones being a 'puseyite,' I cannot conceive where that notion originated. She is staunch Church of England. But the farthest possible from those religious Societies who have made the fatal mistake of thinking they could do good by separating themselves from 'the world.' . . .
    "Both she and I are earnestly desirous of some new arrangement by which her nurses can be raised to be 'Sisters,' if they wish it. But neither the funds nor the statutes of St John's Ho; (not made by her) allow of this at present.
    "You will say that all this rests upon my assertion. But, after all, if my life has not proved to the world that I prefer a system involving collision, however painful, with secular authorities, to ruling supreme over a 'Puseyite' Religious Society, and that I would not hastily form an alliance with any Supt. without knowing her as myself and knowing that she has proved herself of the same mind as this, I don't know what I can prove."

I am sorry, but the Secretary approved the list of new destroyers about ten days ago and one of them was down to be called the EVANS. I fear I am partly responsible, as I submitted a proposed list . . . and perhaps I should have written to you about it beforehand . . . ."

    Franck Taylor Evans (1875-1934) was a U.S. Navy Captain and son of Rear Admiral Robley D. "Fighting Bob" Evans. In November of 1908, Evans was sentenced to loose 150 "numbers" and be publicly reprimanded for a number of infractions, including drunkenness on duty and treating with contempt his superior officer. Loss of numbers had the consequence of increasing the amount of time before voluntary retirement became available; it was a form of punishment abolished by President Clinton in 1999.

Lord, how I would like to see this country's foreign policy properly managed and above all to see her take a proper view as to the naval and military needs! . . ."
    When Roosevelt founded the Progressive Party in 1912, he divided the Republican party of which he had been the leader. After the Progressives failed to win the presidency that year and had diminishing success in later elections, Roosevelt strived for a reconciliation with the Republicans as the 1915 presidential election approached, outraging both Republicans and Progressives. The "victory" Roosevelt refers to in this letter is likely not political: on May 22, Roosevelt had won a five-week libel suit brought against him which had consumed his attention at a time when historic events were taking place, most importantly, the sinking of the Lusitania on May 7 by a German U-Boat, pressuring President Wilson into joining the war that Roosevelt had supported for some time.

    Although the entire cycle of Der Ring des Nibelungen was not completed until 1869, Wagner began soliciting financing for performances of the work from Friedrich I, Grand Duke of Baden, beginning in 1857, when Wagner completed the second act of Siegfried. Wagner was also in contact with Karl Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, for the same purpose; thus, it is unclear which duke is being referred to in the present letter.
    On August 1, 1863, in Frankfurt am Main, the Congress of Princes was convened to reform the German Confederation.

  DESCRIPT: LAWRENCE, D.H.
  CROSSHEAD: Autograph Letter Signed, to his agent James Brand Pinker, in pencil,

  TYPESET: sending a manuscript of "The Miracle" [not present; published as "The Horse
    Dealer's Daughter" in the April 1922 issue of <i>English Review</i>], expressing
    gladness at not having to deal with publisher Methuen & Co., speculating about
    the prospects of his novel [<i>Women in Love</i>, (1920)] and some poems, complaining
    of his inadequate payment by publisher Mitchell Kennerly for his novel <i>Sons
    and Lovers</i> [1913] and other works, and anticipating better success in the
    American market. 1½ pages, 4to, onion skin paper, written on two sheets; small
    bust portrait mounted along its upper edge to second page just below signature,
    some brittling and chipping to edges with minor loss at upper corners, folds.
  year: 1917
  pullquote: 'STILL BITTER ABOUT "THE RAINBOW": "I AM GLAD THERE IS NO MORE METHUEN"'
  FOOTNOTE: |-
    "I send you the MS of another story--'The Miracle', which is beautiful and ends happily, so the swine of people ought to be very thankful for it.
    "I am glad there is no more Methuen. You will do as you think best about the novel. I don't suppose anybody will be dying to publish it, though it is a chef d'oeuvre. Perhaps the faithful Duckworth will rise up & be noble: though I very much doubt his paying. . . .
    "I shall be rather glad if nobody wants those little poems. Then I shall put them in the fire.
    "It would be a good thing if Mitchell Kennerley sold all the rights to my things. He has swindled me unscrupulously. For everything of mine he has ever done, he has paid me only £10 . . . . I am sure the American rights of Sons & Lovers are worth more than £10 . . . .
    "I am determined that I will have some money before long. I am sick of poking about in a corner, up to the neck in poverty. It is enough. I think America is my untilled field."
    Published in The Letters of D.H. Lawrence, eds. Boulton and Robertson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), 3, #1354.
    In 1915, soon after Methuen & Co. published Lawrence's The Rainbow, reviews criticized the novel's sexual content, and a court, finding the book obscene, ordered all copies destroyed. Methuen & Co. complied without offering any defense. Women in Love, Lawrence's sequel to The Rainbow, was published five years later--in America.
