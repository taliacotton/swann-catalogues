  TYPESET: >-
    London: Charles Knight, 1732.<br><br>First edition, octavo, regular paper
    issue; engraved title with profile portrait of Roger Bacon (dampstain to
    lower margin); bound in full original publisher's moiré-textured brown cloth
    boards, rebacked, 6 3/4 x 4 1/4 in.<br><br>Babbage, with his invention of
    the Difference Engine, a mechanical calculator designed to tabulate
    polynomial functions, is considered the father of modern computing.
    Babbage's Engine would be operated by turning a crank, which would turn a
    series of geared brass number wheels whose increments are dictated by the
    metric system, thus performing a series of calculations. One full turn of
    the handle accomplishes one sequence of operations. The principle at work is
    that of Newton's method of divided differences. Babbage did not create a
    working version during his lifetime, but it was successfully constructed
    with minor alterations by scientists in 1991. The science fiction steampunk
    genre also owes a debt to Babbage. Had his machine caught on in the early
    19th century, one may imagine the Victorians fitted out with a panoply of
    sophisticated high tech gear and inventions.

    in.<br><br>The economic turmoil of the Great Depression prompted many to
    question the wisdom of allowing an unregulated free market to self-correct.
    Keynes suggested that a cash-starved economy would continue to perpetuate
    the downward slide. His sustained criticism of existing economic theory
    carried great influence. "I believe myself to be writing a book on economic
    theory which will largely revolutionize-- not I suppose, at once but in the
    course of the next ten years --the way the world thinks about its economic
    problems. I can't expect [...] anyone to believe this at the present stage.
    But for myself I don't merely hope what I say, in my own mind, I'm quite
    sure. (see John Cassidy's "The Demand Doctor," The New Yorker, 3 October
    2011, quoting a letter Keynes wrote to George Bernard Shaw on 1 January
    1935, referring to the present work.)

    the adventures of Amadis's son Esplandián. He visits a mysterious island

    an extent that when explorers to the Americas asked the local population
    about the existence of such a place, rumors indicated that it might actually
    be real. The rocky barren peninsula that earned the name, first believed to
    be an island, had neither a race of women fighters who fed their victims to
    griffons, nor swords made of solid gold, but we do call it California. (cf.

    Muntaner was personally acquainted with the Kings of the Houses of Aragon,
    Mallorca, and Sicily.  Meeting Jaume I as a child inspired his own career as
    an Almogavar mercenary. As a writer, his style is that of a direct oral
    interlocutor with firsthand experience of his own tales. This work was an
    inspiration to Cervantes as well, who read the Valencian Tirant lo Blanch, a
    work drawn mainly from Muntaner, with great enthusiasm. These medieval
    chivalric works are based on and inspired by historic events, but
    simultaneously mark an essential phase in the development of the western
    novel by way of Cervantes.

    does happen, Heasyamma chief of the Breeas and his sub chiefs will be alone
    responsible and if your government ever has a chance, you can avenge the
    treachery with ten good men." Adding, "I could drive out the whole

    Cherry writes, "to hunt the elephant as I have hunted him for my existence
    depended on my success. And I have had in my possession seven tons of ivory
    in that length of time. [...] and I have lived with the natives like a
    native and with their means. Authorities have said it was not possible to
    live. I have made it practical and I believe even beneficial, and the
    natives I think I can furnish a treatise that will show up the African in a
    new light that will give homogeneity to the natives all over Africa, and a
    basis on which to work out the anthropological questions which are as yet
    unsolved.";<br><br>A large hand-drawn map; a photograph of two African men;

    parchment, consisting of forty-one gatherings, mostly in quires of ten
    leaves [approximately 400 leaves]; first and last two signatures with seven
    leaves each (lacking presumed blank conjugates), without obvious signs of
    missing text; quire 38 with five leaves; all other quires with an even
    numbers of leaves [4, 8, or 10] and seemingly complete, based on the
    positioning of catchwords, rule of Gregory, and evidence of sewing thread at
    the center of the gathering.<br><br>The first six leaves contain a calendar
    of Carmelite use; text in two columns throughout, in a neat gothic hand,
    written in dark brown ink with some passages in red; capital strokes and
    two-line initials throughout decorated with pen tracery; catchwords at the
    foot of the verso of the last leaf of each quire throughout, centered at the
    foot of the page; one six-line gilt initial on a blue and green ground with
    gilt-decorated marginal floral extensions on folio 28, with the main

    Neidrée; front board becoming detached, ffep detached; housed in a custom

    Turnbull Library Record, May 1971, vol. 4 no. 1, Christopher de Hamel
    describes a Carmelite Book of Hours held in New Zealand. (A copy of this
    publication is included in the sale of this lot.) Calendrical evidence
    gleaned from de Hamel's article aids in confirmation of the Carmelite
    attribution and date. At the opening of the text [folio 28 recto] the order
    is explicitly named.<br><br>"A Carmelite friar owned very few books. Soon
    after joining the Order he was given a book allowance which, at the end of
    his novitiate, he was to spend on his basic text, a Breviary. This book
    contained a fuller version of the Book of Hours. If there was any money left
    over from the purchase of his Breviary it might be spent on other books. A
    mendicant friar would not have been able to possess many books. The books he
    did own were his for life and could not be sold, given away, or pledged, and
    they were recoverable on his death by the convent where he said his first
    Mass. From here they could be redistributed again but only to those friars
    who would respect the gift and keep it within their Orders." (see de Hamel's
    article cited above.)

    edition in French, small folio, illustrated with three very large (nearly
    full-page) woodcut illustrations; text printed in gothic letter, attractive
    set of woodcut initials used throughout; bound in full 19th century calf by
    Koehler; the final leaf, blank but for printer's woodcut device, lacking and
    provided in facsimile, 9 1/2 x 6 3/4 in.<br><br>Caviceo's romance was first
    published in Italian in 1508 and was very popular. The tale of Peregrino and
    his love Genevera follows the now classic "star-crossed" motif, long before
    Shakespeare explored the theme. "Caviceo tells their tale with brio in a
    delightful array of narrative modes, including amatory epistles,
    philosophical digressions that anticipate later Renaissance dialogues in
    love treatises, autobiographical references, seemingly realistic courtroom
    dramas, and outlandish tales. After Peregrino endures many trials, including
    abduction by pirates, dangerous trips to the Orient and to Hell, almost
    insurmountable obstacles erected by Genevera's family, and wild intrigues of
    all kinds, the bumbling protagonist finally unites in marriage with his
    beloved." (Quoted from Sherry Roush's Speaking Spirits: Ventriloquizing the
    Dead in Renaissance Italy, University of Toronto Press, 2015, page 118

    generally agreed upon that the erudition of Jesuit scholars enhanced the
    prestige of the Order, it became increasingly difficult for members of the
    Order to publish secular works during the 17th century, not least because
    prohibited opinions were codified in 1651. Censorship and self-censorship
    led to an absence of specialized treatise and gave rise to a vast production
    of reference books such as textbooks and compendia written by Jesuits.
    Hence, Reinzer's Meterologica is apparently such a mixture of different
    genres because the author resorted to an emblem book as camouflage for a
    specialized treatise on meteorology. [...] Reinzer's publication was well
    informed with regard to astronomy and natural philosophy on the whole."

    Pierre-Paul) Sirven's daughter Elisabeth disappeared from her home in
    Castres, France in March of 1760. Her family was distressed to find that she
    had been taken without their consent to a Catholic convent in an attempt to
    turn her away from the Protestant faith. She suffered from a neurological
    disorder and was returned to her family, but subsequently disappeared again
    only to be found dead at the bottom of a well in 1762. Her father was
    charged with murder and sentenced to be burned alive. Her mother was
    sentenced to death by hanging. The family fled after the sentence,
    eventually garnering the interest and support of Voltaire, who helped get
    the entire family pardoned. These pamphlets were published after Sirven
    surrendered himself to the authorities in 1769, and before he was pardoned
    in Toulouse in 1771. Voltaire commented, "It only took two hours to sentence
    a virtuous family to death and it took us nine years to give them justice."
