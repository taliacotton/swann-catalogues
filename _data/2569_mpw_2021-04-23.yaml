    Inc.<br><br>The female figure depicted here  is most likely drawn from a
    live subject. Her likeness is repeated in many of Bauer's early figurative
    works, though the identity of this model is unknown. <br><br>Rudolph Bauer
    was one of the early pioneers in Non-Objective art, a form of abstraction
    void of recognizable imagery and reliant on line, color, and form to evoke
    an emotional and even spiritual reaction from the viewer. <br><br>In 1915
    Bauer became involved with Der Sturm, a gallery in Berlin run by Herwarth
    Walden. Walden promoted Bauer's works as well as artists active in der Blaue
    Reiter. Also involved with Der Sturm was Hilla Rebay.  Bauer and Rebay
    developed a relationship, at first romantic but eventually a business
    venture driven by their mutual passion for the promotion of Non-Objective
    art. <br><br>This gouache, and the following drawing are part of a body of
    illustrative work Bauer created before, and into his time affiliated with
    Der Sturm.

    Watercolor on paper, c.1920. 260x197 mm; 10¼x7¾ inches. <br><br>Provenance:
    The Artist; Hilla Rebay Foundation; Snyder Fine Art, NY; Private collection.
    <br><br> In 1927 Hilla Rebay left Germany for New York City. Her goals,
    shared by Rudolf Bauer, were to promote Non-Objective art in America, and to
    find a patron of means to collect and help promote this artistic concept. 
    Solomon R. Guggenheim would be that patron. Rebay at his side and Bauer as
    their agent in Germany, Guggenheim established a foundation, amassed a
    collection of Non-Objective art and would eventually house his collection in
    The Museum of Non-Objective Painting, with Hilla Rebay as his director.
    <br><br>Solomon R. Guggenheim's foundation, with Hilla Rebay at the helm,
    gave stipends to artists and encouraged their pursuit of pure abstraction. 
    Many artists benefited from this program, including Rudolf Bauer, Rolph
    Scarlett, Irene Rice Pereira, Alice Mattern, and Penrod Centurion.

    uniquely American modernist style, some artists objected to Hilla Rebay's
    purist ideals of abstraction, void of recognizable subject matter.  In 1936,
    at the studio of sculptor Ibram Lassaw, a group of artists began meetings
    and formed the American Abstract Artists group. As one voice, they overcame
    the exclusion faced by modernist American artists from museum and gallery
    exhibitions, and funded shows of their own.  Amongst the founding members
    were Ibram Lassaw, Carl Holty, Charles Green Shaw, Werner Drewes, John
    Opper, and Giorgio Cavallon. Later members also include John Little, Judith
    Rothschild, and Sidney Gordin.

    increased the likelihood of an American role in the conflict, government
    attention to the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project, and
    subsequent funding dried up. Many artists were left with little options for
    showing their work.  In New York City artists began formal gatherings,
    initiated by artist Philip Pavia, at 39 East 8th Street. These gatherings
    would become known as The Club, and the discussions would reach fruition
    when these artists collectively organized and held an exhibition in 1951
    called The 9th Street Show.  This show is seen by many as the beginning of
    Abstract Expressionism and The New York School. Followin the success of The
    9th Street Show, galleries began opening close by, notably, Hansa Gallery,
    and Tanager Gallery. Stable Gallery opened in 1953 on West 58th Street.

    Milton Avery, and artists often refered to as color field painters, he began

    Artists, angered by what they saw as a bias of juror selection for a pending
    exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, penned an open letter to the
    museum president, Roland L. Redmond, stating their grievances. The letter
    was penned by Adolph Gottlieb, and signed by many, including Jimmy Ernst,
    Theodoros Stamos, Ibram Lassaw, and Robert Motherwell. Barnett Newman
    delivered the letter to the New York Times, and it appeared on the front
    page Monday, May 22, 1950. This rebellious act by a handful of artists
    caused such a stir, Life magazine published a follow-up article complete

    organic forms.  Theodoros Stamos painted many works utilizing sea forms as a

    reminiscent of Wassily Kandinsky's biomorphic period, inspired by his
    introduction to microscopic images of  life forms.

    spent most of his life in the Washington DC area, and is often included in
    listings of the DC Color Field artists.  His exploration in color and
    striped formats was arrived at independently, yet he was exhibited at
    important DC galleries that emphasized DC Color Field, such as Henri
    Gallery, and the artist owned and operated Studio Gallery founded in 1956 by
    artist Jeannie Lea Knight. Hilleary lived a life of dual careers as both a
    painter and an architect.  This work was conceived, site specific, for an
    opening between rooms in the second home of the Bell family, and is meant to
    be viewed from both sides.
