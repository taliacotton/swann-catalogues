  TYPESET: >-
    An absolute masterpiece of modern graphic design, Hohlwein referred to this
    poster as "The man with the saddle." The use of a subdued background serves
    to delineate the overall image from the checkered riding pants and scarlet
    waistcoat that Hohlwein constructed in a cut-out fashion, inventing a
    revolutionary style of illustration in the process. This image was so
    striking that it became an emblem of the company, which used it on catalogue
    covers and even on their clothing labels. When the German design magazine
    <i>Gebrauchsgraphik</i> dedicated an entire issue to Hohlwein, the artist
    drew a modernized version of the image, which shows just how important it
    was to Hohlwein himself.  Hohlwein / Stuttgart 3 (var), Hohlwein / Munich p.

  TYPESET: >-
    When Hohlwein received the official commission to design the poster for
    Germany's participation in the 1910 Brussels World's Fair, he stuck with a
    very academic artistic inspiration. The straightforward image of a naked man
    astride a horse is executed in Hohlwein's singular style with the unexpected
    additional flourish of the Brussels skyline, laid out across the bottom of
    the poster. Hohlwein 120, DFP-III 1363, Wember 416.

  TYPESET: >-
    From 1908 to 1914, the Munich-Herrsching Ceramic Works was a prominent
    producer of Jugendstil pottery. Hohlwein's graphic still life with three
    vases is an exceptional design, in which the window is reflected in the
    vessels, an effect that Hohlwein achieves using the white of the paper. The
    bold image is further strengthened by the organization of the typography
    which is firmly aligned with the width of the image. Hohlwein / Stuttgart

    This image is so similar in style to the early work of Ludwig Hohlwein,

    coffee, produced by Heinrich Franck Sohne GmbH; the image of "the Kornfranck

  CROSSHEAD: W. HOFFMANN PIANOS. 1912.
  at-a-glance: '27x18¼ inches, 68½x46¼ cm. Adolf Simmel, Berlin.'
  TYPESET: >-
    A painter and a poster designer, Schulpig was very active in Berlin. In
    1905, when Lucian Bernhard invented the Object Poster, with his seminal
    image for <i>Priester</i> matches, he could not have foreseen how much his
    new style would influence an entire generation of poster artists. Bernhard's
    poster for Steinway & Sons, in 1910 (see Swann Sale 2099, Lot 103), was a
    pure manifestation of this new style; a flat representation of the object,
    huge lettering and a monochromatic background. Schulpig's cleanly-executed
    image can certainly be considered a "tribute" to Bernhard, neatly recreating
    the feeling of the poster, albeit with slightly more detail to the piano and
    more text. Schulpig was not the only artist to find "inspiration" in
    Bernhard's piano imagery, as Julius Gipkens borrowed liberally from the
    style for his poster for <i>Pianos Steck</i> (see DFP-III 1044). Not in DFP,

    Cardinaux studied painting with Franz von Stuck in Germany, and also worked

    colors and broad outlining was a revolution in the Swiss graphic art world.
    This fauvist image of a yellow horseman astride a green horse, promoting a
    Swiss Exhibition, proved to be scandalous; it took a patriotic subject and
    treated it with such unrealistic color that the normally passive Swiss
    surprised everyone by rallying against it. Cardinaux 37, Plakat Kunst p. 70,

    A key figure in Swiss graphic design and international typography, Ernst
    Keller taught at the Kunstgewerbe Schule in Zurich from 1918 until he
    retired in 1956, imparting his key tenets of simplicity and legibility to
    two generations of Swiss designers. Keller designed a version of this poster
    in 1926 (for an earlier exhibition), with the two primary colors inverted.
    Two years later, with the exhibition held in a different venue, he revamped
    the earlier design. Using bold, sans-serif typography, he organized the
    space to provide impeccable legibility. This poster served as a model for
    many designers who continued to use the same system for decades.

  TYPESET: >-
    Late in 1922, Schwitters and van Doesburg planned a small tour around the
    Netherlands with a traveling Dada show in order to introduce local artists
    to their work. The initial evening had been scheduled for December 27, but
    Schwitters had problems with his passport and the first show was delayed
    until January 10. In all, there were 17 separate performances in 8 different
    locations. The first event was held at the Haagsche Kunstkring in The Hague.
    The address of the venue is included in the poster's upper right corner
    ("Haagsche K.K. Binnenhof 8"). For subsequent performances in other
    locations, the poster was slightly changed; this address was removed and a
    small plug for van Doesburg's Dada magazine, <i>Mécano</i>, was added that
    read, "Abonnement Mécano F5 per Jaar." Otherwise, the two versions of the
    poster are identical. The poster has the event program and Dada slogans
    presented in sophisticated disorder, using different hand drawn typography
    and varying font sizes. "The poster's discordant appearance reflects the

    A painter, typographer, graphic designer and teacher, Dexel was appointed as

    Closely associated with the Bauhaus, he became one of the most prominent
    practitioners of Constructivism. Here, promoting the use of gas ["Always use
    gas for cooking, baking, heating, lighting / because it is practical, clean,
    inexpensive / Saves work, time, money,"] one sees the confluence of art and
    commerce, wherein the most mundane of advertisements can be presented in an
    elevated manner. Dexel's strict Constructivist style "used exclusively
    typography and abstract geometrical markers" (Avant Garde p. 64). He
    eschewed pictorial imagery for the "the use of ornament based entirely on
    the precise geometric forms of the rectangle and the circle, and the almost

  TYPESET: >-
    Dr. Fritz Kahn was an Orthodox Jewish gynecologist in Berlin, who published
    popular illustrated books including <i>The Cell</i> and <i>The Jews as a
    Race and Cultural People</i>. In his books and articles, he "visualized the
    structure and function of the human body in a very unique way."
    (http://www.fritz-kahn.com). This poster of <i>The Human as Industrial
    Palace</i> is exemplary of one of his conceptual designs, presenting a
    playful but instructive comparison between industrialism and anatomy, and
    elevating the traditional medical diagram into 20th century graphic design.
    When the Nazis took power, Kahn's books were banned and publicly burned, and
    Kahn left Germany for Palestine and then the U.S., with the help of his
    friend Albert Einstein. While some of his works were translated into
    English, without the resources to produce new books, Kahn fell into
    obscurity. His innovative designs were still influential to future artists,
    and the first exhibition of his works, <i>Fritz Kahn - Maschine Mensch</i>,
    opened in Berlin in 2010 and featured this mechanical image.Includes the

    Molzahn was a painter, printmaker, graphic designer, theorist and teacher.
    Although he was never officially a member of the Bauhaus, his work did
    appear in the group's third portfolio. In 1928, his seminal essay, "Stop
    Reading, Look!" hailed photography as the powerful new universal medium that
    would become a liberating means of communication. In 1929, he designed this
    and one other poster for an architectural and design exhibition in Breslau,
    <i>Dwelling and Workplace</i>. It is a tour-de-force of photomontage,
    typography and composition, in which all the elements of design and
    construction are represented. In 1938, Molzahn left Germany for America
    (seven of his artworks had been put on display in 1937 at the German
    Degenerate Art Exhibition). He taught at Moholy-Nagy's School of Design in
    Chicago from 1943-1947 and returned to live in Germany in 1959. Rademacher

  TYPESET: >-
    Dobrolet, the Russian Society of Volunteer Air Fleet, was founded in 1923 as
    part of Lenin's New Economic Policy, which allowed for a form of limited
    capitalism in certain large businesses. As a partially public company, it
    originally sold shares to Russian citizens. Rodchenko was employed to help
    market the company and went on to design posters and other advertising
    material for them. The text on this poster reads, <i>"To All . . . If one is
    not a shareholder of Dobrolet, one is not a citizen of the USSR / One golden
    ruble makes everyone a shareholder of Dobrolet."</i> During the mid to
    late-1920s Rodchenko worked with Vladimir Mayakovsky on advertising
    campaigns for Mosselprom and GUM as well as Dobrolet. In the 1930s, the
    company lost its shareholder status and became part of the Soviet collective
    economy - as "Aeroflot." Rodchenko, who was young and virtually unknown when
    he began his association with Dobrolet, used "simple geometric forms as the
    material for visual inventions and combinations . . . by means of pure
    geometric forms, all the shapes were transformed into symbolic patterns
    (signs), that could be visually simple and as clearly understandable as
    letters of the alphabet" (Rodchenko / Lufthansa p. 31). This poster was
    printed in four different color schemes, including red and black, red and
    green, green and black, and red and blue. Rodchenko 82, Modern Poster 133,

    A key figure of the Russian Avant Garde, Lithuanian Jewish artist Lissitzky
    was known for his typography, photography, architecture, and propaganda
    design, as well as his belief that artists could use their work to bring

    books. <i>About Two Squares</i> is Lissitzky’s children’s fable about a
    black square and a red square that fly to earth. Signifying the supremacy of
    the modern Soviet order (the red square) over the old and conventional (the
    black square), Lissitzky uses his signature abstract style, combining ideals
    of the Suprematists, like Malevich, with elements of the Constructivist

    "In 1925, [Walter] Gropius commissioned Bayer to design a typeface for all
    Bauhaus communications . . . He used his approach to modern typography to
    create an 'idealist typeface” (Designhistory.org). This hand-drawn and
    notated maquette appears to be the exact template used for the <i>Universal
    Type</i> image published in MoMA’s 1938 exhibition catalogue <i>Bauhaus
    1919-1928</i>. The typeface displayed is captioned as “Universal type,
    characters at base show bold, medium and light weights, 1925. Improved
    1928.”The rendering of this typeface (with the same spacing and formatting
    as this maquette) was also reprinted in <i>PM Magazine</i>, Vol. 6, No. 2,
    December 1939, an issue that was designed by and featuring Bayer. In the
    article about <i>Universal Type</i>, Bayer details his requirements for a
    new alphabet, including the “geometric foundation of each letter,” avoidance
    of hand-written elements, like up and down strokes, and varying thickness,
    and simplification of forms to the most basic. "Banishing diagonals wherever
    possible, he constructed characters such as "k" and "x" with circular
    segments in place of the expected angles" (Modernity p. 200). Perhaps most
    noticeable in this new alphabet, is the absence of capitalized letters. Two
    other ink and guache maquettes for Univeral lettering are in the collections
    of the Harvard Art Museum (Modernity p. 201).

    A fabulous and startling piece of Modernist design, this booklet was
    commissioned from Herbert Bayer by Leo Lionni, the art director of N.W.
    Ayers at the time. Filled with powerful photomontages, color illustrations,
    dynamic layout and diagrams, the imagery here combines with the text to form
    a sort of science fiction narrative applied to the real world. Within its
    pages, the electron is explained and FM radio is promoted, as well as the
    nascent technology for television. The use of electricity to aid in public
    safety, agriculture and medicine is also illustrated. MoMA 561.1999.

    A complete two-year run of this lifestyle magazine. Among the artists whose

    Alexander Hackenschmied, Karel Teige, Vladimir Krejcar, Le Corbusier, Man
    Ray, Max Ernst and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. Sutnar, as Artistic Director of
    <i>Druzstevni Prace</i>, was responsible for the artistic design of this
    magazine, the covers of which are all like mini posters. Following Karel
    Teige's belief that "the cover was an advertisement for the book . . . and
    to make this desirable poster-like balance as strong an impact as possible
    [the artist must choose] primary colors and geometric shapes," Sutnar added
    his own elements of photomontage and typography to Teige's concept of cover
    design (Oxford, p. 59). His aesthetic helped to further promote
    Functionalist design into mainstream society. These issues frequently appear
    bound together; it is <i>rare</i> to find them loose, as issued. Berman /

    Sironi was a painter and an early member of the Futurist movement in the
    years before World War I. After the war, he was one of the founders of the
    Novecento Italiano movement and began supporting Mussolini. He contributed
    hundreds of illustrations to and designed covers for the Fascist newspapers
    <i>Il Popolo d'Italia<i> and <i>La Rivista Illustrata del Popola
    d'Italia</i>. He also designed pavilions for exhibitions and numerous
    posters, both political and commercial (including Fiat). He eventually
    abandoned easel painting in favor of communicating via "a fusion of
    decoration and architecture exemplified by Gothic cathedrals. He felt that
    the mural was the proper basis of a popular national art" (Il Castello).

  TYPESET: >-
    An excellent piece of American anti-Nazi propaganda intended for use in
    Italy. Most likely, this image was released late in 1943, a time when the
    Italian Government was in convulsions. Late that July, Mussolini was ousted
    and Pietro Badoglio elevated to Prime Minister; on September 3rd a secret
    armistice between Italy and the Allied forces was signed and publicly
    announced on September 8th. Then, on October 13th, Italy declared war on
    Germany. Two months after he was arrested, German forces were able to free
    Mussolini and install him as head of a new Fascist state in Northern Italy.
    Italy was embroiled in a civil war. This poster, "Out with the Germans," one
    of at least two American propaganda images with the same title, was likely
    released as the Allied forces moved north towards Rome, and the Germans
    tried to solidify their positions in the north of the country. IWM PST 0035.

    Italian designer Munari was a true modern Renaissance Man - known as a
    visual artist, inventor, industrial and graphic designer, who also
    contributed to literature, poetry and theories of learning. His artwork was
    displayed in many Futurist exhibitions, and he associated with the Futurist
    movements until distancing himself after World War II. Munari also found
    himself working on children’s books, and like Depero, toy design. Later, in
    1959, he designed the layout of this folded invitation (printed in Italian
    and French) from the International Committee of Honor on the occasion of the
    founding of the Depero Museum in Rovereto; it displays text of concrete Poet
    & Futurist Carl Bellioli. It is the only Futurist museum in Italy and was

    Swiss Graphic Designer Monguzzi studied in Geneva and London before
    launching his career with Studio Boggeri in Milan in 1961. He later moved to
    Montreal to design nine pavilions for the 1967 International and Universal
    Exposition, then settled back in Switzerland to continue designing and
    curating. The Museo Cantonale d'Arte, founded in 1987, commissioned Monguzzi
    to devise the institution's logo as well as posters for each exhibition and
    program. This poster for an exhibition on Oskar Schlemmer's stage sets and
    costumes for Stravinsky's <i>Les Noces</i>, highlights his aptitude in
    creating dynamic typographic compositions. It also bears an uncanny

  TYPESET: >-
    Brodovitch was a key figure in the development of 20th century graphic
    design. Born in Russia, he immigrated to Paris where he first distinguished
    himself as a graphic designer, working for a host of prestigious clients
    such as <i>Aux Trois Quartiers, Arts et Métiers Graphiques, Cahiers
    d'Art</i> and the restaurant Prunier. His designs won him five awards at the
    1925 Art Deco exhibition. In the early 1930s, he moved to New York, where he
    eventually became the art director for <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>, during which
    time he hired A.M. Cassandre, as well as other top European designers like
    Man Ray and Herbert Bayer, to design covers for the magazine. He was also
    responsible for nurturing and developing young American talents such as
    Richard Avedon. This <i>rare</i> poster is Brodovitch's first published
    work, the result of winning a poster design competition to advertise a ball
    for Russian émigrés in Paris. The image is reflective of the Parisian art
    movements of the period, swinging between Cubism and the newborn Surrealism.
    Andy Grundberg cleverly analyzes it as "suggestive of both the influences on
    him and of his own future directions. The graphics, light to dark inversion
    of its mask shape, type and background not only suggest the positive
    negative process of photography but also symbolically represents the process
    of masking; one trades one's identity for another, contrary one" (Brodovitch
    p. 24). These posters were printed in black and white and hand-painted,
    making each one slightly different from the others.

    Kurozumi worked for the Osaka National Railways in the 1930s. The small

    simple, bold, stylized images reflect his ability to give the "illusion of
    modernization" through the use of ideographic forms (Fraser p. 63).
    Advertising new schedules with more trains travelling to Sakurai and
    Wakayama, the artist here presents information in a minimal way; employing a

    A prolific poster designer based in Basel, Bühler worked for many of the

    luxurious bath soaps and their innovative recipe for violet-scented perfume,
    Vera Violetta. As seen in this poster, as well as in a design by Brun, Roger
    & Gallet also produced lipstick in gold metallic cases during the 1940s. A
    smaller version of this Bühler image exists, with a fuschia glove, printed

    Clifford and Rosemary Ellis married in 1931 and worked together for the rest

    colorful and fanciful qualities of children's illustration, yet is also
    compelling, eye-catching and charmingly composed. Their aesthetic certainly
    appealed to a large swath of the general public, as the duo was commissioned
    to design posters for the London Underground, Shell, the General Post Office
    (GPO) and the Empire Marketing Board. This poster was commissioned by the
    GPO Film Unit to advertise "Cable Ship," a 12 minute documentary on the
    repair of an International Telephone Exchange submarine cable that had been
    damaged. The 1933 film was grouped with 4 other short films, all centering
    on Post Office activities and repair work, and released in 1935 to
    considerable cinematic success. After the war, the artists primarily focused
    on book cover design.

  TYPESET: >-
    American-born Kauffer rose to prominence as a graphic designer in Great
    Britain where his work for Shell and the London Transport System, among
    others, assured him a place on the list of great 20th century graphic
    artists. In 1940, Kauffer returned to America where he worked on accounts
    for Pan American, American Airlines and other advertisers. Thanks to a
    proliferation of posters, "Keep it Under Your Stetson" became as common a
    catchphrase during World War II as "loose lips sink ships," the only
    difference being the former was not only a patriotic command, but also a
    marketing ploy. Using a photograph of a hat (it is, after all, a hat poster
    first and foremost), Kauffer depicts a man in profile staring at a distant

    Although he was born in America, McKnight Kauffer spent his most creative
    years in Great Britain, acting as the "Chef de file" of the new generation
    of poster artists. After his groundbreaking poster design for the <i>Daily
    Herald</i> was published in 1919 (based on his seminal Vorticist work
    <i>Flight</i>), he received commissions from many major clients, the most
    important being London Transport, for which he designed 141 posters over a
    span of 20 years. This version of <i>Daily Herald</i> is a smaller,

    Perhaps the most famous image in Nitsche's General Dynamics series, this
    depicts the <i>USS Nautilus</i>, one of the country's first nuclear powered
    submarines. "It was an indelible logo in its day. Set against a gradated
    gray background, the shell was a virtual cornucopia of progress. The
    submarine was not seen as a killing machine, but rather the offspring of
    progress poised to help the world"
    (https://www.typotheque.com/articles/erik_nitsche_the_reluctant_modernist).
    It should be noted that the ongoing project to construct the <i>Nautilus</i>
    was so top secret that Nitsche was only provided a basic idea of what the
    submarine would ultimately look like. This is the French language poster

    Nitsche followed the success of his first series with <i>Exploring the

    poster, however, seems to stand alone as the one image Nitsche designed for
    General Atomic, which was founded as a subsidiary of General Dynamics in
    1955. "Triga [is] a nuclear reactor whose unique uranium zirconium hydride
    fuel elements provide a self-regulating power level and, as a result, a
    guarantee that the reactor will not run wild as the consequence of some

    meltdown-free reactor. It went into operation on May 3, 1958. Modern

    A prolific practitioner, teacher and writer, Tschichold was one of the

    Son of a calligrapher, and a student at the Academy for Graphic Arts in

    Constructivists like El Lissitzky. He moved to Munich in 1926 and continued
    teaching and designing until intense pressure from the Nazi party forced him
    to flee to Switzerland. He eventually moved to England, where he was
    responsible for a complete redesign of Penguin Books. This poster for The
    Professional Photographer exhibition in Basel uses an underlying geometric
    structure based on a neat grid of vertical and horizontal lines to convey
    information in a clean and organized manner. The use of a photographic
    negative arouses curiosity and creates an eye-catching image, while also
    alluding to the technical aspects of photography. "Many graphic designers
    mastered the camera alongside the tools of illustration, layout and
    lettering . . . Tschichold's letterpress poster features precisely
    articulated elements that punctuate the page: the mechanical bite of the
    press is felt in the design. Tiny letters pierce the surface like tight
    black stitches while the larger headline contains a rainbow of colors
    printed with a single pass of the press" (Mechanical Age p. 76). Modern

    Rand was first employed by IBM in 1956 to redesign the company's logo. He
    continued consulting for the company for more than 30 years, redesigning
    their logo at least twice more. In 1981, he came up with the now-famous
    rebus, which has become one of the most famous and recognizable corporate
    identity statements of the 20th century. It took a year for the company to
    actually use the design in promotion, at which point they printed it as a
    poster with small text at the bottom explaining the significance of each
    element of the rebus. This is the first printing. Modern Poster 211,

    kind. . It was also the most unusual, remarkable, uncompromised consumer
    magazine I had seen ever" (Aiga.org). Includes Issues 1-26. Images available

  TYPESET: >-
    Yokoo, who can be credited as the artist who introduced Pop Art to Japan,
    did much of his earliest work in silkscreen, resulting in brighter colors.
    He designed this poster for the Persona Exhibition at Tokyo's Matsuya
    department store in November 1965. The image, commenting as it was on the
    stifling nature of Japanese society on artists, was shocking, sensational
    and became an instant classic. Yokoo 280, Modern Poster 275, Word and Image

  TYPESET: >-
    The attitude of the Japanese toward marketing ingeniousness allowed Yokoo a
    kind of artistic freedom he would have been hard pressed to find in Western
    economies, where marketing often acts to censor creativity. Here, Yokoo
    announces the publication of a serialized essay by Yukio Mishima (the pen
    name of Kimitake Hiraoka, one of the major Japanese avant-garde authors of
    the 20th century). The image combines such classical Japanese graphic
    elements as the rising sun and a great wave, with a Western-style locomotive
    and pin-up girl. Yokoo additionally designed book covers and other posters
    for the author as well. Aside from his literary legacy, Mishima is also
    known for having committed traditional suicide after a failed military coup.

    One of Yokoo's earliest posters, this promotes a book by Isamu Kurita, for
    which Yokoo also did the illustrations. Kurita wrote, "in considering
    illustration now, in its newer broader sense we can think of it as having
    the position within the sphere of design which adds flesh to words, sounds
    and forms." This "sensitive" design approach was perfectly suited to Yokoo's
    style. <i>Rare</i>. Musee de l'Affiche / Yokoo p. 3, All About Yokoo p. 72,

    Lithuanian-born graphic designer George Maciunas was the founder of the
    Fluxus movement in 1961, a network of international inter-media artists who
    focused on the process of creating art, rather than the finished product.
    Influenced by avant-garde composer John Cage and Dada artists like Duchamp,
    Fluxus focused on "anti-art" and "anti-commercialism," with a spirit of
    humor and wit. Fluxus hosted public performances, festivals and street
    events in various cities, with contributing artists like Joseph Beuys, Nam
    June Paik, Ray Johnson and George Brecht. This reinvented image of the
    American Flag is attributed to Maciunas in collaboration with John Lennon
    and Yoko Ono. Maciunas did not sign works during his lifetime, in line with
    his manifesto on the dispensability of the artist's identity, but the poster
    is referenced in Fluxus publications. Another variant is printed only in red
    ink. Images of an Era 110, Graphic Design in America p. 58, MoMA
