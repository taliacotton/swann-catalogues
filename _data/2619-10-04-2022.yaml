  FOOTNOTE: >-
    When Robert Morris became the first and only U.S. Superintendent of Finance
    in 1781, the government was nearing bankruptcy and public credit was on the
    verge of collapse. The Bank of North America, which Morris had helped
    establish in part to finance the closing chapter of the Revolutionary War,
    depended upon Morris's own private fortune and loans from abroad. Haym
    Salomon (1740-1785), a Jewish Polish-American businessman who had joined the
    Sons of Liberty in NY and served as paymaster for the French forces in North
    America during the Revolution, was contracted by Morris to sell the bills of
    exchange he issued beginning in 1781. By July 12, 1782, Salomon was
    advertising his services on behalf of the U.S. as "Broker to the Office of
    Finance," designating the work he continued until 1784. Although the
    nation's economy would not recover for many years, the Bank of North America
    and other financial reforms Morris had set in motion enabled the fledgling
    country to endure.

    1789, he turned to two of the nation's largest banks--the Bank of New York
    and the Bank of North America--for short term loans to help pay the
    government's debts. Partly to service the loans, and partly to control the
    amount of gold and silver coin ("specie") available for use by the
    government, Hamilton occasionally ordered the collectors of duties at the
    nation's various ports to accept as payment the notes issued by these and
    other state banks. The Treasury then took the collectors' notes to the same
    banks and received specie in exchange. On April 15, 1793, when Hamilton's
    efforts to balance credit and specie had helped bring the financial crash of
    1792 under control, the collectors were instructed by Hamilton to cease
    accepting notes issued by the Bank of New York, thereby clearing the way for
    the Bank of the United States to play a larger role in the national economy
    and to provide an increasingly stable national currency.<br>Published in The

    Fall; I will try a part of it next Spring, if as I hope it is a Summer
    Grain, of which please to inform me; otherwise I shall keep it carefully
    till next autumn.<br>"I observe your Meteorological notices with much
    pleasure: Though we cannot govern the winds, we may ascertain the laws by
    which they are governed, and by this knowledge we may usefully regulate our
    conduct. I have thought it probable, that by the destruction of our Forests
    & the settlement of the Country, the different parts of the United States
    will be reduced much nearer an equality of temperature, than they . . . are
    at present. That the Southern States are becoming cooler in Winter is I
    think certain. The cultivated Tracts are now protected by Forests from
    eighty to one hundred feet in height; when they are destroyed the currents
    of Wind will sweep the surface of the Earth. These currents travel at the
    rate of from sixty to one hundred miles an hour. I observe that when our
    cold is at zero, with a wind from North to North West, the observations at
    Washington exhibit the same degree on the same day. This morning . . . the
    cold was 12° below zero, with the wind at North West. If the wind had been
    due North I should feel almost certain, that the same degree prevailed at
    Washington. The general cause of the state of our Climate depends as I
    apprehend on this. The tropical current from East to West is arrested by the
    Cordilleras & the great Western Chain, ending in the Rocky Mountains &
    directed Northward: the recoil of this Current is up the Mississippi &
    eastward, by our great Rivers to the Lakes & down the St. Lawrence. That
    part of this Current which flows up the Ohio and its Branches is warm & mild
    and is the cause of their mild Winters, but when the current is down, from
    the Lakes & especially when it is from Lower Canada, the Southern States
    soon feel the extremes of Cold, which will become more perceptible and
    affect their cultivation as their Forests are reduced. We perceive this
    effect in Connecticut, where vegetation is not so early as it was formerly &
    not more early than in Vermont. The difference between Connecticut &

    not always close, the two were together at one of the most formative moments
    in both their lives. In 1858, Brown shared Douglass's home in Rochester, NY,
    as he worked out the details for his raid on Harper's Ferry. Although Brown
    encouraged Douglass to join him at Harper's Ferry, Douglass declined. After
    the raid, and the Civil War that followed it, Douglass delivered a speech at
    Harper's Ferry that acknowledged the importance of Brown to history and to
    the cause of justice, a cause to which Brown and Douglass shared the same
    level of devotion: "If John Brown did not end the war that ended slavery, he
    did, at least, begin the war that ended slavery."

    a right to pursue sexual gratification and tender love, expressing concern
    about the letter Freud received from the husband of Mrs. B., expressing
    contempt for--especially American--public opinion, expecting Americans to
    conclude that psychoanalysis is responsible for ruining American morals,
    committing to stand against American public opinion in this matter but

    of his obligation as an analyst to live as a moral example and help improve
    the standards of society, apologizing for the errors due to having written

  pullquote: 'REACTING TO SCANDAL: "I CONFESS TO THE UTTER CONTEMPT OF PUBLIC OPINION"'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    ". . . I found your letter . . . and thinking it over for about a week I
    first of all have to thank you for your kind consideration in submitting the
    matter to me before it becomes public. I then see I have to give you account
    on two points, the first of which is my real part in the affair, the second
    my relation to the dangers you proclaim as imminent. . . . <br>". . . As you
    are an analyst yourself I may trust you will not have thought it likely that
    I had acted as an advise-giver to Frink or Mrs B. You know it is not the
    passion of analysts to give out advise and to direct people in the line of
    our own preference. It is one of the distinguishing traits from the Jungians
    that we avoid doing so either in favour of ethics or in opposition to it. I
    simply had to read my patients mind and so I found out that he loved Mrs B.,
    wanted her ardently and lacked the courage to confess it to himself. He
    struggled against a great many resistances, all of them . . . of an internal
    subjective psychological order. External difficulties did not come into
    consideration . . . .<br>"I had to explain to Frink what his internal
    difficulties were and did not deny that I thought it the good right of every
    human being to strive for sexual gratification and tender love if he saw a
    way to attain them, both of which he had not found with his wife. When he
    grew uncertain of his mind I had to take the side of his repressed desires
    and in this way became the advocate of his wish for divorce and marriage
    with Mrs B. In a conversation with the latter I felt entitled to guarantee
    the intensity and truthfulness of Frink's affection for her. I found her
    mind wavering too, but love for her husband played no part in the dilemma.
    She only doubted if Frink loved her really or deeply enough. So for me it
    was a case of honourable serious love versus convention, there my interest
    ended and the situation has not changed for me since then.<br>"Now I am
    quite aware that the public would not be able to grasp the difference
    between my real behaviour and my alleged advising both to divorce and to
    marry each other. But I hope you see it. From your letter I learn that the
    situation has changed indeed owing to a turn in Mr B's behaviour as his
    silly letter to me shows. I have no hold on this new practical side of the
    matter and have even less advise to offer than before . . . .<br>"The second
    point is my relation to the dangers threatening from Mr B's action against
    analysis. I confess to the utter contempt of public opinion and public
    opinion in America especially, where life seems to be more governed by
    hypocrisy and sham morality than even here. I have no doubt that the public
    will behave as if divorce was unknown in America before psychoanalysis
    ruined American morals and as if adultery never had occurred there except
    when people were analyzed. I for my part would take my stand against this
    tyranny of public lie and you may remember I did so in my former life on
    some important points paying [for] my obstinacy by 15 years complete
    isolation. Yet I suspect you in America might be more dependent on public
    opinion which with you is more unrelenting and kills a man more thoroughly
    than on the continent. So I see the expediency of any measures apt to avoid
    scandal . . . .<br>"I too live by my patients, yet it should be remembered
    that analysis is not only a way of earning his living but implies the
    obligation of fighting prejudice, leading up to a higher degree of personal
    freedom and modifying by teachings as well as by example the standards of
    present society. If Frink decides to have his way in regard to the woman he
    claims to be married with I think the analysis of New York ought to stand by
    his side and make it as easy for him as possible without being afraid of a
    passing tempest in a corrupted and vile press. . . ."<br>Horace Westlake
    Frink (1883-1936) was an American psychoanalyst and physician who co-founded
    the New York Psychoanalytic Society and who became Freud's professional
    representative in America until mental illness and scandal ended his career.
    Beginning in 1921, Frink struggled increasingly to maintain his mental
    health even as he practiced as an analyst, seeking treatment in sessions
    with Freud. Frink had fallen in love with one of his own patients, a married
    woman, Angelika Bijur, at a time when he himself was married. Frink's wife
    recognized that her husband's mental health was suffering and agreed to
    divorce him, expecting that marriage to Mrs. Bijur would help him. When Mr.
    Bijur learned of what had happened, he threatened Frink with a lawsuit for
    having violated the professionalism expected of an analyst. Because of
    Frink's connection to Freud, when the newspapers made the matter public, the
    scandal affected Freud's own reputation and his hopes for American
    psychoanalysis.

    Nagasaki three days later, the B-29 bomber Enola Gay flew on April 29, 1946
    to Kwajalein Island in order to take part in Operation Crossroads during
    which a Mark III nuclear bomb was dropped on Bikini Atoll to test its power
    on marine vessels. Although the Enola Gay was initially expected to make the
    drop after a competition was held to find the ideal crew, command announced
    that the drop would be made by Woodrow Swancutt's crew in another B-29,
    Dave's Dream. Feeling snubbed, commander Paul W. Tibbets, navigator Theodore
    J. Van Kirk, and the rest of the Enola Gay crew remained at Kwajalein as
    consultants. On the day of the drop, Tibbets and Van Kirk reviewed weather
    reports and noted that the calculations produced by the crew of Dave's Dream
    would result in the bomb missing its target by over 1,000 feet, which
    information they offered to the Dave's Dream crew. Tibbets's advice was
    ignored, and when the bomb was dropped on June 30 at 21:00 UTC, it missed
    the target, just as Tibbets and Van Kirk anticipated. One of the logs in the
    present lot dated July 1 records Enola Gay's flight from Kwajalein to
    Honolulu the following morning. On July 24, the Enola Gay was flown to
    Davis-Monthan Army Airfield in AZ, where it was put into
    storage.<br>Provenance: Theodore J. Van Kirk, thence by gift to present

    probably on Thursday next, as I shall be in Boston on that day, I might be
    enabled to pay him. I will call on you on Wednesday or Thursday, in relation
    to it."<br>Amos Bronson Alcott (1799-1888) was a teacher, philosopher, and
    father of Louisa May Alcott. In 1844, Ralph Waldo Emerson recognized that
    his friend Alcott had fallen upon especially hard times, so he
    arranged--together with Alcott's brother-in-law Samuel Joseph May, and
    Samuel Edmund Sewall, who was executor of the estate of Mrs. Alcott's
    father--to acquire a house for the Alcott family. In 1845, Emerson purchased
    Mr. Cogswell's pig farm in Concord, Emerson's partners reimbursed him for
    their portion of the payment, and the Alcott family took possession of the
    estate, turning it into "The Hillside," where several scenes in Louisa May
    Alcott's Little Women took place, and where Nathaniel Hawthorne later moved,
    renaming it "The Wayside."

    Small 4to, custom bound in contemporary blue buckram, gilt-lettered front

    marks to rear cover; offsetting to front and end matter. An ostensibly
    unique bound volume containing typed copies of 33 letters from Firbank to
    his publisher Grant Richards, sequentially dated from 26 December 1914 to 18
    August 1917, around the period that his first two novels, Vainglory and
    Inclinations, were published. Also with 5 of the original Autograph Letters
    Signed, of those included in the book, one mounted and the 4 others laid in
    within two envelopes (each bearing the typed legend "Spring List: Item
    105"). The reason for this typewritten volume's production is not entirely
    clear; it's appearance would seem to pre-date Richard's death in 1948 and it
    is not unlikely that it was produced for Richards himself. [Np, nd]. [With:]

    few small scratches and spots to back wrapper, publisher's printed
    announcement cellotaped to front wrapper. First edition, first state of the
    uncorrected proofs with all suppressed content extant. The front wrapper and
    title-page with the misspelling of the author's name ("Hamiton"). The
    publication was halted by Salinger who objected to Hamilton's use of many of
    his unpublished letters: "Salinger received a set of the galley proofs of
    this version (the 'May galleys') and learned from the galleys and the
    footnote citations to his letters that the letters had been donated to
    university libraries. In response, he took two actions. First, he registered
    79 of his unpublished letters for copyright protection. Second, he
    instructed his counsel to object to publication of the biography until all
    of Salinger's unpublished materials were deleted"
    (http://www.law.cornel.edu/copyright/cases/811_F2D_90.htm). The text was
    then revised by omitting or closely paraphrasing much of the quoted material
    and a second set of proofs was released later the same year (the "October
    galleys") but did nothing to placate Salinger, who instituted legal
    proceedings to halt publication. The suit ultimately reached the Supreme
    Court, who ruled in Salinger's favor. A scarce Salinger item, containing the
    only appearance in print of some of his significant correspondence, largely
    sourced from the Harvard, Princeton and University of Texas libraries.
