  DESCRIPT: HENRY OSSAWA TANNER (1859 - 1937)
  CROSSHEAD: Head of a Sheep.
  TYPESET: >-
    Oil on canvas, mounted on board, circa 1880-81. Approximately 267x254 mm;
    10½x10 inches. Signed in oil, lower left recto. With a cropped oil study of
    a nude on the verso of the board.<br><br>Provenance: the estate of the
    artist, with estate blue ink stamp and the ink signature of Jesse O. Tanner,
    on the frame back; Grand Central Art Galleries, New York, with the label on
    the frame back; the artist Harry Andrew Jackson; thence by descent, private
    collection, Wyoming.<br><br>Henry Ossawa Tanner painted Head of a Sheep
    early in his studies at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts when he
    cultivated the speciality of painting animals. With the support of his
    parents and inspiration from the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition, Tanner
    enrolled at the Academy in December of 1879. A year later, he began life
    drawing classes under the tutelage of Thomas Eakins. After an interest in
    maritime painting, Tanner settled on painting animal subjects, with his
    stated desire "to become an American Landseer." According to Anna O. Marley,
    "Tanner was so devoted to animal painting that he bought a sheep to serve as
    a model for his pastoral compositions." This small study has clear ties in
    subject to Tanner's 1881 Boy and Sheep Under a Tree, but its bold passages
    of painterly brushwork are closer to his naturalist study of lions, Pomp at
    the Zoo, circa 1880, and Lion Licking its Paw, 1886. Marley p. 19; Mosby pp.
    74-75.

  TYPESET: >-
    Oil on canvas, mounted on board, circa 1907-08. 330x406 mm; 13x16 inches.
    Signed in oil, lower right.<br><br>Provenance: private collection,
    Chicago.<br><br>William A. Harper painted this beautiful, pastoral landscape
    on the outskirts of Paris during his second French trip. Like fellow
    landscape painters Edward M. Bannister and James Bolivar Needham, Harper was
    born in Canada; his family moved from Ontario to Illinois in 1885. Harper
    attended the Art Institute of Chicago from 1895 - 1901, working as a
    nightwatch man and janitor to pay for his tuition. Graduating with honors,
    he then studied in Paris from 1903 - 1905 at the Académie Julian following
    in Henry Ossawa Tanner's footsteps, and was greatly influenced by the
    Barbizon School. In 1905, Harper earned the Municipal Art League's blue
    ribbon at the Art Institute of Chicago for nine of his paintings. On a
    return trip to France from 1907-08, Harper studied informally with Tanner
    and his paintings became more Impressionist. Harper's career was cut short
    when he died of tuberculosis only a few years later at the age of 36. The
    Art Institute held a memorial exhibition in Harper's honor, showcasing 60 of
    his works. Today, his paintings are in the collections of the Metropolitan
    Museum of Art, the National Gallery (The Evans-Tibbs Collection), the
    National Museum of African American History and Culture, Smithsonian
    Institution, the Columbus Museum of Art, the DuSable Black History Museum

    N. 43rd St., Philadelphia, PA" in ink, verso.<br><br>Provenance: private
    collection, Philadelphia.<br><br>This modernist still life is a scarce
    example of Laura Wheeler Waring's painting from the early 1930s. It displays
    Waring's painterly exploration within the bounds of traditional genre
    painting, and the influence of post-Impressionism on her development. One of
    her larger and best known works from the period is the exuberant floral
    painting Still Life, 1928, which was once in the Evan-Tibbs Collection of
    Washington, DC.<br><br>Waring began painting watercolors in her early teens
    and won several awards before graduating from the Hartford Public High
    School in 1906 and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, in 1914. Her
    distinguished career included two periods of study in Paris. The first
    sojourn was interrupted by the beginning of World War I, and she eventually
    returned to Paris in June 1924. This second period is widely regarded as a
    turning point in her style as well as her career. Waring painted portraits
    until October when she enrolled for a year of painting study at the Académie
    de la Grande Chaumière. There she studied with Boutet de Monvel and met
    Henry Ossawa Tanner and Gwendolyn Bennett - enjoying her "only period of
    uninterrupted life as an artist with an environment and associates that were
    a constant stimulus and inspiration. My savings, however, would not allow me
    to continue this life indefinitely." In addition to the Harmon Foundation in
    New York, Waring exhibited at the Pyramid Club in Philadelphia and Howard
    University through the 1940s. Her paintings today are in the collections of
    the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and
    Howard University. Sharpley-Whiting pp. 86-87.

    painting at the Los Angeles County Museum in 1935, the first solo exhibition
    there for an African American. According to Lizzetta LeFalle-Collins,
    African Woman is likely a portrait of Maudelle Bass Weston, the dancer and
    model who also posed for the ceramic bust entitled Maudelle. Thousands
    visited the exhibition, and Los Angeles newspapers and the Associated Press
    covered the story. Her portraits of African people are noted for their
    realism and attention to detail; this is one of only a few known paintings.

    having been officially admitted to the Florida Bar in 1914. After practicing
    law in Knoxville, Tennessee and Tampa, Florida, he settled in Jacksonville
    in 1919, where he practiced until his death in 1972. Mr. Perkins was a
    strong proponent of civil rights and a community leader; in 1968, the former
    Colored Lawyers Association of Jacksonville changed its name to the D.W.
    Perkins Bar Association in honor of Perkins, who had been a founding member.
    During a family vacation to the 1939 World’s Fair, Perkins purchased
    Savage's souvenir replica.<br><br>Exhibited: Through Our Eyes 2000; Lift
    Every Voice and Sing, the Ritz Theatre LaVilla Museum, Jacksonville,
    Florida, February 8, 2000. <br><br>Augusta (Christine Fells) Savage was born
    in Green Cove Springs, just south of Jacksonville. After first exhibiting
    her sculpture in Palm Beach and Jacksonville, Savage moved to New York to
    study sculpture. She was admitted to the Cooper Union School of Art in 1921,
    and completed the four year course in three years. In 1929 and 1931, Savage
    was the recipient of two successive Rosenwald Grants, which enabled her to
    travel to France and study at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris.
    When she returned to New York in 1932, she opened the Savage School of Arts
    and Crafts in Harlem, where her students included William Artis, Jacob
    Lawrence and Norman Lewis. In 1935, she was a founding member of the Harlem
    Artists Guild, and from 1936 - 1937 she worked for the WPA Federal Arts
    Project as the Director of the Harlem Community Art Center. <br><br>A
    life-size version of Lift Every Voice and Sing was commissioned by the 1939
    New York World's Fair committee in 1937. Savage left the WPA to work on this
    monumental project, inspired by Jacksonville brothers James Weldon and
    Rosamund Johnson's anthem Lift Every Voice. Her iconic sculpture stood
    almost 16-foot high, in painted, cast plaster on the grounds of the fair.
    Sadly, the original work was destroyed when the fair was over - it is known
    today only from photographs and these smaller versions which were cast by
    the artist to be sold as souvenirs.

    the Art Students League with Thomas Hart Benton. In 1932, he exhibited in
    the first Washington Square Outdoor Art Show and continued to work as a
    sketch artist there. From 1934 to 1940, Delaney worked for the WPA on
    projects in New York City including the Index of Design for the Metropolitan
    Museum of Art, the Pier 72 mural, and the Story of the Recorded Word mural
    at the New York Public Library.

    example of the earliest abstraction by Norman Lewis, from his first full
    year painting completely abstract. By fall 1946, Lewis joined the Marian
    Willard Gallery in New York, and began a new series of linear abstract
    paintings in the spring of 1947. Untitled is closely related to his Magenta
    Haze and Twilight Sounds, collection of the St. Louis Museum of Art, each
    dated March 1947. Their ground's distinct color adds atmosphere to each
    composition. At this time,  Norman Lewis was also clearly inspired by jazz
    and improvisation--Duke Ellington wrote his blues-inflected composition
    Magenta Haze in 1946. His first solo exhibition at the Willard Gallery in
    1949 included six paintings from 1947: Magenta Haze, Spring, Street Scene,
    Subway, Reflection and Twilight Sounds. Other notable 1947 paintings in are
    Autumn, collection of the Worcester Art Museum, <Changing Moods, the

    hero, revolutionary leader and general François-Dominique Toussaint
    L'Ouverture is a significant 1940s drawing by Richmond Barthé - a very
    scarce study for an important Haitian commission.<br><br>In the fall of
    1948, Barthé was awarded commissions by Haiti's president Dumarais Estimé -
    a new coin with Estimé's profile and two large public monuments to honor
    both L'Ouverture and his successor Jean-Jacques Dessalines. The monuments
    were by far the largest commissions Barthé had taken on - envisioned as part
    of a grand two hundredth anniversary commemorating Port-au-Prince's founding
    as the nation's capital. For L'Ouverture's portrait, in 1949, Barthé hired
    Ural Wilson from Katherine Dunham's dance company as a model. The artist
    translated his model dressed in period costume and holding a sword into a
    larger than life heroic figure. The bronze was cast in New York and shipped
    to Haiti in 1950, but it was not publicly unveiled until 1954, after Barthé
    had completed the second monument of Dessalines for the new president Paul
    Magloire. Vendryes pp. 143, 150-154.

  CROSSHEAD: Untitled (Head of a King).
  TYPESET: >-
    Carved marble, mounted on a granite base, circa 1950 -1955. Approximately
    330x241x51 mm; 11 3/4x9½x2 inches (not including the base). Incised
    signature on the backside.<br><br>Provenance: private collection, Chicago;
    private collection, South Carolina; private collection (2012).<br><br>This
    marble carving is an exceptional and extremely scarce work of the great
    Chicago sculptor Marion Perkins. Born in Marche, Arkansas, at the age of
    eight, Perkins was sent to live with relatives on the South Side of Chicago
    in 1916. Marion Perkins attended Wendell Phillips High School, the first
    Chicago high school where the majority of the students were African
    American. He soon married Eva Gillon, who became his model and muse; they
    had three sons and settled in Bronzeville. While interested in theatre and
    literature, Perkins worked a series of menial jobs to support his family
    until he acquired a newstand in the late 1930s. Perkins then had the
    resources and time to create an outdoor studio in his backyard. Not only a
    talented stone carver, the self-taught artist also carved in wood, and
    modelled in clay, plaster and steel wire.<br><br>Perkins first gained
    attention in 1940 with two stone works included in the American Negro
    Exposition. With the opening of the Southside Community Art Center that
    year, Perkins had an artistic venue where he could both exhibit and teach;
    he soon became an important figure of the Chicago Renaissance. His first
    triumph was being invited to exhibit at the Art Institute of Chicago's
    prestigious Annual Exhibition of American Art in 1942 where he showed his
    powerful limestone carving John Henry. After participating in several
    invitational exhibitions, in 1947 the IBM Corporation acquired his Figure at
    Rest. Then in 1948, his beautiful marble Ethiopia Awakening won the prize in
    sculpture at the Art Institute's Annual Exhibition of Artists of Chicago and
    Vicinity, and Perkins was awarded an esteemed Julius Rosenwald Fund
    fellowship grant.<br><br>Perkins's direct approach to stone sculpture is
    epitomized by his iconic 1950 Man of Sorrows. This powerful African American
    head of Christ with a crown of thorns was the sensation of the 1951 annual
    Chicago artists invitational at the Art Institute; it was featured in an
    Ebony magazine profile, and acquired by the museum. Perkins often found such
    fine materials in vacant lots and abandoned houses on the South Side. With
    Untitled (Head of a King), Perkins was not deterred by the narrowness of the
    marble slab - he rendered this regal head in three dimensions by carving the
    profile in the thin outer edges. This distintictively modern approach,
    influenced by Brancusi and Modigliani, is also seen in his pair of limestone
    heads, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, circa 1955. Despite these successes and
    widespread acclaim in Chicago, Perkins never received national
    recognition.<br><br> His sculptures are found in the collections of the Art
    Institute of Chicago, the DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center,
    and the National Gallery. Marion Perkins continues to exert his influence on
    contemporary art today. Kerry James Marshall's monumental picture, Souvenir
    III, 1998 includes a homage to the artist in his painting, along with Bob
    Thompson, Zora Neale Hurston, Dorthy Dandridge, and Augusta Savage.

    Signed in ink, lower right.<br><br>Provenance: gift from the artist, Rev.
    Dr. Alger L. and Jesse M. Adams, Hasting-on-Hudson, NY; thence by descent,
    private collection, New York. <br><br>In June 1951, Westchester African
    American community leaders, Rev. Alger L. Adams and his wife, Jessie, of
    Hastings-on-Hudson, sponsored a cotillion-styled ball at Sarah Lawrence
    College for 1,951 of Westchester's Black high school graduates. Inspired by
    the notion of a cotillion, they formed a committee of community peers and
    executed the fête. A long-time family friend of the Adams', Lawrence was
    asked to design the cover for the invitation. After the invitations were
    printed, the original painting was returned to the Adams. Then Lawrence
    waved away their offer to return the original and instead gifted it to them.
    <br><br>This wonderful, elegant drawing is both a significant example of
    Jacob Lawrence's mid-career work on paper, and a notable modern
    representation of Black social history. In 1951, Lawrence began a series of
    paintings that explored similar themes of performance - including
    Vaudeville, collection of the Hirshorn Museum, Smithsonian Institution,
    Chess on Broadway, exhibited at Twenty Eighth Venice Biennale and Magic on

    pencil, lower margin.<br><br>In this wonderfully expressive linoleum cut,
    Charles White reinterprets his iconic 1957 ink drawing Folk Singer (Voice of
    Jericho: Portait of Harry Belafonte).<br><br>Harry Belafonte was a important
    figure to Charles White - a friend, patron, collaborator and inspiration. In
    the late 1950s, White made musicians, singers and actors the subjects of his
    work--from the famous to the anonymous. While they had met in the early
    1950s through their membership in the Committee for the Negro Arts, White
    and Belafonte became close friends and collaborated often once White moved
    to California. Andrea Barnwell describes how "with a generous gift from
    their dear friend Harry Belafonte," Frances and White rented a house from
    friends on Summit Avenue in Pasadena in 1956, before they moved to nearby
    Altadena. Belafonte also wrote the introduction to White's 1958 ACA Gallery
    exhibition catalogue when he first exhibited Folk Singer, and the foreword
    to the 1967 book Images of Dignity: The Drawings of Charles White. In the
    latter, Belafonte describes the profound connection he made to the work of
    Charles White: "You are enriched by the experience of having known Charles
    White's people, who are like characters from a great novel that remain with
    you long after the pages of the book have been closed." Through White's
    hand, we become familiar with this great singer.<br><br>This is a very

    (2006).<br><br>Exhibited: on loan and view at the Birmingham Museum of Art,
    Birmingham, Alabama, 2013-2022.<br><br>This significant steel sculpture by
    Harold Cousins comes from an important early body of modernist work, made
    during his first decade in Paris. Born and raised in Washington DC, Cousins
    attended Howard University and served in the Coast Guard during World War
    II. Cousins then moved to New York, enrolled at the Art Students League and
    focused on creating sculpture. While there, Cousins studied under William
    Zorach, Will Barnet and Reginald Marsh, and also met his wife Peggy Thomas.
    They moved to Paris in October of 1949. Cousins first studied with Ossip
    Zadkine, and became close friends with artists Karel Appel and Shinkichi
    Tajiri, a fellow student of Zadkine's. Cousins also joined a community of
    expatriate African American artists in Paris including Ed Clark, Beauford
    Delaney, Herbert Gentry and Larry Potter. With funding from the GI Bill,
    many American artists moved to Paris to be at the forefront of the post-war
    art world. <br><br>Viking is an iconic example of Cousins's mature postwar
    practice in Paris. Inspired by the Spanish modernist Julio Gonzalez, the
    first artist of the era to explore a new technique of welding steel, Cousins
    created delicate, expressive sculptures, which brought him great acclaim in
    Europe. Viking is similar to Cousins's La Reine, 1952, in the collection of
    the Eskenazi Museum of Art, Indiana University - its dynamic form takes on
    strikingly different shapes from different view points. The first major
    exhibition of these steel sculptures was at Galerie Raymond Creuse in Paris
    in 1954.<br><br>A group of these early works were reunited in 1996, and
    included in the Studio Museum in Harlem traveling exhibition Explorations in
    the City of Light: African-American Artists in Paris, 1945-1965. Early 1950s
    steel sculptures by Cousins are in several museum collections today,
    including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Yale University Art
    Gallery. Holman-Conwill pp. 62-63.

    painting by Felrath Hines - a scarce large canvas from his first abstract
    period. Born in Indianapolis, Hines studied painting and design at the Art
    Institute of Chicago, where he befriended artist Charles Sebree. Inspired by
    Sebree, Hines moved from Chicago to New York in 1946. In the 1950s, he
    quietly developed an organic abstraction idiom while working in the shop of
    master framer Robert M. Kulicke. Through this close contact with the art
    world, Hines was both introduced to many other artists and his future career
    in art conservation.<br><br>Hines achieved critical recognition for these
    beautiful, painterly abstractions of nature with two solo exhibitions at
    Parma Gallery in 1957 and 1959, and his inclusion in group exhibitions at
    the John Heller Gallery and Parma Gallery in New York and the Barnett Aden
    Gallery in Washington, DC in the 1950s. In the late 1950s, Hines also met
    Romare Bearden, with whom he would later become a founding member of the
    Spiral Group in 1963. Several paintings from this breakthrough period of
    abstraction are now in institutional collections; including Transition,
    1953, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Hanging Garden, 1954, SFMOMA, Untitled
    (Abstraction), circa 1960, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, and

    exhibited in this solo exhibiton.<br><br>Illustrated: Roberta Smith, "Romare
    Bearden's Seen Abstract Side", The New York Times, March 19,
    2020.<br><br>Wine Star is an excellent and significant example from Romare
    Bearden's period of abstract color field painting of the late 1950s.
    Bearden's development of abstraction was influenced by non-Western intuitive
    approaches to imagery. In the mid-1950s, Bearden had an interest in Zen
    Buddhism and studied calligraphy and Chinese landscape painting with a
    Chinese calligrapher. His late 1950s works display less of an interest in
    the activity of action painting of expressionism, as described by his friend
    the writer Harry Henderson in a 1989 interview - "He found a rationale by
    studying Zen philosophy. His works were always serene and lacked the
    tremendous physical involvement employed by the Abstract Expressionists."
    Sharon Patton also described a "mystical elegance" in these abstract works,
    and the influence of Chinese painting is found in their asymmetry and an
    entry point into the painting. Patton illustrates this phase with Bearden's
    Blue is the Smoke of War, White the Bones of Men, circa 1960, from the Harry
    B. Henderson collection and sold at Swann Galleries on September 15, 2005.
    <br><br>Bearden's abstract painting impresses with its vital fluidity and
    technical virtuosity. Roberta Smith's rave review of the 2020 DC Moore
    exhibition of Abstract Romare Bearden posits his abstract painting's
    significance; "they effortlessly claim a place in the history of American
    postwar abstraction, stain painting division." These beautiful paintings
    embrace accident, staining and the canvas through a technique of pouring,
    staining, dispersion and dripping. While Bearden's period of experimental
    painting is later than the mid-1950s celebrated color field painting of
    Morris Louis and Helen Frankenthaler, his experimentation was independent;
    as Smith put it simply, "Bearden developed it on his own". This notable
    chapter in his development has been largely overlooked until recently. The
    abstraction of Bearden is now the subject of a national traveling museum
    exhibition organized at the Neuberger Museum of Art by its director Tracy
    Fitzpatrick. Fine p. 222; Gelburd/Rosenberg p. 40; Patton p. 173.

    Galleries, Boston, MA, March 24 - April 26, 1962; Charles Alston, The
    Gallery of Modern Art, New York, NY, December 3, 1968 - January 5, 1969.
    This retrospective, sponsored by Farleigh Dickinson University, included 53
    paintings and 3 sculptures by Alston, including all eight of the Black and
    White paintings. They were exhibited alongside his other important series
    African Theme,Blues Singer and Family from the 1950s and 60s in the new New
    York museum designed by Edward Durell Stone at 2 Columbus Circle. In their
    chapter on Charles Alston, Romare Bearden and Harry Henderson wrote that
    Alston "considered the black and white abstractions in the retrospective of
    1968 to be amongst his most important he had done."<br><br>Black and White
    #3 is a striking and beautiful abstraction by Alston, a significant work
    from his important series of eight abstract paintings between 1959 and 1961.
    By 1960, Alston achieved wide recognition for his post war painting,
    including the Emily Lowe Memorial award for An Ancient Place, and a solo
    exhibition at Feingarten Galleries, New York that year. Like his friend
    Norman Lewis, Alston found the limited palette of black and white provided
    both aesthetic and narrative themes that enabled his abstraction to reflect
    a social and political consciousness. Alston and Lewis both effectively gave
    the color black new meaning at the height of the Civil Rights era struggles.
    In Black and White #3, Alston masterfully creates a dynamic composition
    through a great variety of applications of black paint on the white ground -
    from impastoed strokes to thin wash. His experimental approach includes
    dispersal, blotting and monotype.<br><br>Another painting from this series,
    Black and White II, circa 1960 is in the collection of the Studio Museum in
    Harlem. Two other known paintings from this series are illustrated in Alvia
    J. Wardlaw's Charles Alston monograph, Black and White #1, 1959 and Black
    and White #7, 1961, which was also included in the Brooklyn Museum 2015
    traveling exhibition Witness: Art and Civil Rights in the Sixties. Black and
    White #8 was sold at Swann Galleries on December 12, 2020.<br><br>The Black
    and White series also laid the foundation for Alston's work in Spiral. As a
    founding member of the artist's group in the summer of 1963, Alston,
    alongside the other abstract painters Lewis, Merton Simpson and Hale
    Woodruff, advocated for an art that could address Black identity and the
    social and political issues confronting African Americans during the Civil
    Rights struggle. The Spiral group's first and only exhibition First Group
    Showing: Works in Black and White, May 14 - June 5, 1965, continued his
    monochromatic theme. Bearden/Henderson, Jr., p. 269; Wardlaw p. 91 and 93.

    Texas.<br><br>This haunting nocturne, depicting the silhouette of a burned
    out church under moonlight, is a fascinating, early painting by Kermit
    Oliver. The powerful subject matter is an unusual direct response by the
    Texan artist to the unrest of the mid-1960s, and a condemnation of the
    violent campaigns of terror, including the bombing of Black churches, during
    the Civil Rights period. Oliver continued to paint nocturnal subjects in the
    1970s. This painting is also one of the earliest works of Oliver to come to
    auction.<br><br>From a young age, growing up in Refugio, Texas, Kermit
    Oliver had a passion for depicting his rural surroundings through painting
    and drawing. Oliver's father was an African American cowboy who worked on
    cattle ranches. He attended Texas Southern University in 1960, where his
    professor John Biggers inspired him to stay "true to your own message, your
    own language." After graduating from TSU, Oliver rose to prominence as an
    artist in Houston in the 1970s. When the DuBose Gallery began to represent
    him in 1971, he became the first African American artist in Houston to be
    represented by a commercial gallery. Oliver and his family moved to Waco in
    1984 where, despite the fame from his many Hermès scarf commissions, he
    retreated from the art world. Oliver was honored with a retrospective
    exhibition of his work at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, in 2005, and at
    the Art Center of Waco in 2021. His paintings are in many museum collections
    including the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Southern University, Houston,
    the Laguna Gloria Art Museum, Austin, and the National Museum of African
    American History and Culture, Washington, DC.

    to the collection of Jim and Jeannette Cantrell; private collection. The
    artist traded this vessel for a painting by his friend, Jim Cantrell.
    William Artis was teaching at Chadron State College in Nebraska, and
    Cantrell was teaching at Sidney public school, Nebraska, 1964 -
    1966.<br><br>Born in Washington, NC, William E. Artis moved to New York
    during the Harlem Renaissance like fellow North Carolina native artists
    Charles Alston and Romare Bearden. Artis took private sculpture lessons with
    Augusta Savage and studied with Robert Laurent at the Art Students League
    with a Harmon Foundation scholarship. After service in the air force during
    World War II, Artis studied at the New York State College of Ceramics. He
    exhibited at the Syracuse Ceramic Nationals in 1940, and 1947 through 1951.
    He was awarded the Rosenwald Fund fellowship in 1946 and collaborated with
    the Croatian sculptor Ivan Mestrovic (1883- 1962).<br><br>William Artis
    moved to the Midwest in the early 1950s to teach art and to study the Sioux
    Indian culture - he taught at the Holy Rosary (now Red Cloud) School on the
    Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. Then he joined the Chadron State
    College faculty as an assistant instructor in 1954 - then named Nebraska
    State Teachers College. Artis was professor of sculpture and ceramics at
    Chadron State College until 1965. He then was an associate professor at
    Mankato State College in Mankato, Minnesota until 1975. Artis received a
    retrospective at Fisk University in 1971. William Artis's artwork today is

  TYPESET: >-
    Oil on linen canvas, 1967. 1460x965 mm; 57½x38 inches. Signed and dated in
    oil, lower left.<br><br>Provenance: private collection, New York; thence by
    descent, private collection, New York. <br><br>This bright and energetic
    abstraction is an excellent example of Norman Lewis's late 1960s period.
    Between 1966 and 1969, Norman Lewis painted a series of paintings, each with
    brightly colored grounds and underlying figuration typically in black and
    primary colors. This untitled painting is closely related in color and
    composition to his Masquerade, private collection, from the same year, which
    was included in his 2016-17 retrospective Procession: the Art of Norman
    Lewis. Other known examples from the series are Players, Players Four and
    Playtime; each are from 1966 and reference jazz musicians, a familiar
    subject of Lewis'. This fascinating group of work shows the artist making a
    decided turn, back to more abstract figuration in his painting. These
    paintings represent an important period, coming between his black and white
    Civil Rights and Klan paintings of the early to mid-1960s, and the larger
    scale paintings and Sea Change series to come in the 1970s.

    postwar painting in which he described landscape and natural phenomena
    within the idiom of Abstract Expressionism. This significant and striking
    canvas shows Woodruff's continued evolution as an abstract painter through
    the 1960s. In addition to continuing his Celestial Gate series, Woodruff
    created some of his most abstract painting as landscapes. Landscape is
    typical of Woodruff's late 1960s compositions with bold, horizontal strokes
    over layers of both earthy and jewel-like colors. Other significant 1967
    paintings are in institutional collections, including Ancestral Memory, the
    Detroit Institute of the Arts and Figure, the Metropolitan Museum of Art,

    estate of the artist; private collection.<br><br>Rise People Rise. is an
    important mid-career painting by artist, activist and art therapist Cliff
    Joseph. It is a powerful political and artistic statement created at the
    height of the Black Arts movement. As a founding member of the Black
    Emergency Cultural Coalition in New York, Joseph was working at the vanguard
    of a transformative moment in African American art and history.<br><br>Born
    in 1922 in Panama City where his father was employed in the construction of
    the Panama Canal, Joseph's family emigrated to the United States the
    following year, settling in Harlem. Following military service in the Army
    artillery and WWII, he studied at the Pratt Institute in New York, receiving
    a degree in illustration in 1952.<br><br>Cliff Joseph best described his
    practice of painting: "the power of the art belongs to the people." By 1968,
    both his painting and activism were reaching new heights. That year, Joseph
    painted one of his best known works, My Country Right or Wrong, a powerful
    anti-war statement. In 1968, Joseph also co-founded the Black Emergency
    Cultural Coalition (BECC) with Benny Andrews, Henri Ghent, Reggie Gammon,
    Mahler Ryde and Edward Taylor. Faith Ringgold also became a member of BECC.
    Its founding was a direct response to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's
    controversial exhibition Harlem on My Mind which did not include any Black
    painters or scultpure. Its goal was to increase the representation of Black
    artists in New York galleries and museums. Joseph and the BECC went on to
    also protest the Whitney Museum of American Art exhibition Contemporary
    Black Artists in America, and organized the exhibition Rebuttal to Whitney
    Museum Exhibition at the Acts of Art Gallery in Manhattan.<br><br>Joseph was
    also one of the first African Americans to join the professional practice of
    art therapy, and the first African American to join the American Art Therapy
    Association. He practiced art therapy at Lincoln Hospital and was on staff
    at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.<br><br>Joseph's
    iconic Blackboard, 1969, with its vision of an Afro-centric education, was
    recently included in the important traveling exhibition Soul of a Nation:
    Art in the Age of Black Power organized by curators Mark Godfrey and Zoe
    Whitely at the Tate Modern, London. Rise People Rise is the most significant
    and largest painting of Cliff Joseph to come to auction to date.

    is a monumental landscape by Louis B. Sloan that is inspired by the crossing
    of the Red Sea, an episode in the biblical narrative of The Exodus. Here,
    Sloan uses a variety of brushwork, drips, and splatter in a plethora of
    greys, white and blue to compose mountain-like waves and a shadow of figures
    crossing the Red Sea. The power and drama of the painting are akin to 19th
    Century depictions of the biblical event. Sloan is best known for his plein
    air landscape painting with similar dramatic depictions of natural
    phenomena, including his well known Gathering Storm Over Philadelphia, circa
    1961, in the collection of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts,

    fifty years, Crossley engaged her creative side by writing poetry and
    practicing drawing. Bound to her pragmatic parents, Crossley wanted to major
    in art and study at the Cincinnati Art Academy but was persuaded to pursue
    home economics at the University of Cincinnati, continuing to draw and
    paint. Crossley later enrolled in courses at the Art Institute of Chicago
    while living in Chicago with her husband, Frank Crossley, from 1952 to 1966.
    He was a metallurgical engineer who minored in fine art himself and
    encouraged his partner's artistic interests. After moving to California, she
    studied ceramics and jewelry making.<br><br>Crossley's expressions explore
    composition, color, space, and balance. Her designs consist of geometric and
    architectural forms, or landscapes with sensuous, undulating shapes. Most
    are outlined in black, emulating the range of human emotions. Inspired by
    artists of previous generations, Crossley identified the core of her
    artwork:<br><br>"[It comes from an] ancient art form, originating in Sudan,
    and used in much of ceremonial and ritual design in African artifacts.
    Although I am often identified as a cubist, I consider my style very
    personal and unique—an expression of myself. As an abstract painter, I am
    strongly influenced by African geometric designs. Here I must explain that I
    did not ‘lift' a style from Africa but extended the expression of an
    established form. Abstract art is prevalent in Oceanic art, the islands of
    the Pacific, where Black people remain today producing the same designs for
    wall coverings, clothing, fabrics, and crafts…We, as Black people, owe it to
    our posterity to salvage our culture. We can do this only by becoming
    informed about those things that depict us as a people. We must not limit
    our scope and eclipse our diverse and abundant contributions. I do not paint
    the Black experience. I am a Black woman who paints what she feels, thus
    expressing and sharing her Black experience."<br><br>After living in
    Illinois, the Crossleys relocated to Palo Alto, California, then to Granite
    Bay (near Sacramento) in 1986. She exhibited extensively in Californian
    venues including the Triton Museum, Santa Clara, Fine Arts Gallery, Mountain
    View, Arts Associates West, San Francisco, Berkeley Museum, the Center for
    the Visual Arts in Oakland, and the University of Indiana. Crossley was
    artist-in-residence at the Berkeley Plaza Gallery and the Ebony Museum of
    Art, both in Oakland, where her works were often on display over several
    decades. She lectured on art and exhibited at the University of
    California-Berkeley and in Sacramento. Butler p. 30.

    work in abstraction with paint and collage. Wimberley studied art with James
    A. Porter, Loïs Mailou Jones, and James Lesesne Wells at Howard University.
    While a student, he also played jazz and later developed friendships with
    musicians such as Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, and Ron Carter in New York,
    who also informed his creative sensibility. The artist expressed that his
    use of found papers, objects and torn paper was influenced by the physical
    qualities of collage by Pablo Picasso and Antoni Tàpies utilized in their
    works of the late 1960s and 70s. The artist has infused the formal qualities
    of abstraction with tension from the torn edges of the paper and cardboard.

    and clay modeler George Rogers fabricated a printmaking process he called
    "sculpturegraphs." Inspired by his sculptural and clay molding practices,
    they take shape as biomorphic figures in different colored inks. As a
    variation of relief printmaking, Rogers used found materials, hand-cut
    sinuous shapes, then printed in a single color. In many of them, overlays
    were applied to produce gradations of colors and enhanced images.
    <br><br>George Rogers was born in Alabama and was active in the Detroit
    area. Rogers attended the Columbus School of Art, 1952-53, the Cleveland
    Institute of Art 1955-59, and the Cranbrook Academy of Art, 1959-61. He was
    the first Black clay modeler for the Ford Motor Company and designed the
    Mustang 2. His sculptures are installed around the Detroit area and included
    in the collection of the Renaissance Center. He was also a co-founder of
    Gallery Seven in Detroit which represented, Black abstract artists and
    developed a summer program for children.

    jazz musicians. During the 1980s, he focused much of his work on creating
    portraits of jazz and blues musicians, including popular artists such as
    Ornette Coleman, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday and Lionel Hampton in
    addition to less well-known jazz and blues artists.<br><br>In 1988, Brown
    became the first artist to have a solo exhibition at the Museum of the
    Chinese Revolution at Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China. A touring
    retrospective of his work, Brown: Portraits in Jazz, Blues, and Other Icons,
    originated at the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Kansas City in 2002.
    Today, his paintings are found in the permanent collections of the
    Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Portrait Gallery, the Smithsonian
    American Art Museum and the Studio Museum in Harlem.

    Four digital C-prints from Kodachrome 35mm slides, 1982. Each 406x508 mm;
    16x20 inches. Each signed, dated and numbered 5/8 in pencil, verso. Printed
    in 2015.<br><br>Their flirtation begins * The Debauchees dance to New Wave
    music with the Woman in Red following * The Woman in White eats coconut and
    looks away from the action * The Debauchees dance down the hill, the Woman
    in Red falls further behind.<br><br>Rivers, First Draft was a single, unique
    performance created by Lorraine O’Grady for “Art Across the Park,” curated
    by Gilbert Coker and Horace Brockington. It was performed in the Loch, a
    northern section of Central Park, on August 18, 1982, and was a
    “collage-in-space,” with different actions taking place simultaneously on
    two sides of the stream and further up the hill. The narratives being told
    were competing for attention, simultaneously uniting two different
    heritages, the Caribbean and New England, and three different ages and
    aspects of the self, a young girl, a teenager, and an adult woman. It was a
    three-ring circus of movement and sound that, unlike the randomness of
    Futurists attempting to shout each other down, played more like a unitary
    dream.<br><br>The pivotal moment of Rivers, First Draft occurs after the
    Woman in Red has been ejected by the Black Male Artists from their closed
    studio: she descends to the stream bank where she sees a white stove and
    claims it by painting it red. The figures are actively guided by the male
    New England figure, the Nantucket Memorial statue, while the female
    Caribbean figure, the Woman in White, continues to endlessly grate coconut,
    calmly indifferent to the scene unfolding below. The performance was seen by
    a small invited audience, mostly friends from Just Above Midtown, and
    occasional pedestrians walking through the seldom visited
    Loch.<br><br>Summary courtsey of the artist's website.

    in an interview with C. Ian White the primacy of the found object in his
    practice, and the influence of Duchamp. According to Purifoy, Duchamp left
    us "with the idea that the found object was OK like it was. We didn't have
    to do much to it to make it a part of the creative process, so because of
    Duchamp, I maintained the intergrity of the piece, the object I work with,
    and enable the piece to maintain its originality. You can tell that this is
    a broom handle, this is a skillet, or this is a coffepot." Sirmans/Lipschutz

    international exchange through creative work" and as an even exchange of
    ideas between local and international artists. Thompson conceived Advancing

  TYPESET: >-
    Oil on linen canvas, 1998. 1016x1270 mm; 40x50 inches. Signed in oil, lower
    right.<br><br>Provenance: the estate of the artist; thence by descent to a
    private collection.<br><br>The End is a bold and dramatic painting from
    Hughie Lee-Smith's late series of works inspired by the theatre. His
    depictions of figures in imaginary, staged environments recall Lee-Smith's
    early experiences of dance and theatre while working at the Playhouse
    Settlement (named Karamu House in 1941) during the WPA period in Cleveland.
    Lee-Smith taught art at Karamu House in the late 1930s in return for the
    full scholarship to the Cleveland School of Art (now the Art Institute of
    Cleveland) that the Gilpin Players awarded him in 1935.<br><br>The End is a
    striking painting from this ultimate period of Lee-Smith's oeuvre. With both
    the figures hidden or turned from the viewer, the only faces on view are the
    images of a Greek tragedy mask and an African mask painted on the set. The
    compressed space and floating elements further create a metaphysical,
    dream-like space that reflects the lasting influence of Giorgio De Chirico.
    The End is also a very personal reflection on mortality. Painted after his
    move to Albuquerque in 1997, Lee-Smith was fighting his final battle with
    cancer at the time - he passed away on February 23, 1999 at the age of 83.

    central to Winfred Rembert's young life in Georgia. It is revisited in this
    work, as well as in Jeff's Pool Room, 2003 and Inside Jeff's Cafe, circa
    1997. Jeff was an entrepreneur who owned a pool room in Cuthbert, Georgia,
    who gave Rembert his first job outside of the cotton field. Eventually,
    Rembert ran the business after Jeff fell ill and was unable to work.
    <br><br>Born and raised in Cuthbert, Georgia, Winfred Rembert lived and
    worked as an artist in New Haven, CT. His artwork, painted on carved and
    tooled leather, displays memories of his youth—Black life in the Jim Crow
    South. His artistic vision calls forth vivid scenes from Georgia cotton
    fields and colorful characters from the juke joints and pool halls of
    Cuthbert. They also reveal his encounters with racial and police violence in
    the aftermath of a civil rights protest, and the subsequent seven years he
    spent on a Georgia chain gang.<br><br>His paintings have been exhibited at
    museums and galleries around the country, including the Yale University Art
    Gallery, the Hudson River Museum, and The Adelson Galleries in New York. In
    2011, Rembert was the subject of an award-winning documentary film, All Me:
    The Life and Times of Winfred Rembert, by Vivian Ducat, and in 2015, he was
    honored by Bryan Stevenson’s Equal Justice Initiative. In November 2019, NPR
    aired a segment produced by StoryCorps on the artist. Winfred Rembert's 2021
    memoir Chasing Me to My Grave: An Artist’s Memoir of the Jim Crow South

    leather binding as issued. Edition of 4000.<br><br>Each year, the Peter
    Norton family commissions an art edition to celebrate the holidays. The book
    was privately published and gifted to friends. Another copy of this book is
    in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington,
    DC.<br><br>Through the use of a pop-up book, Kara Walker takes a medium
    typically relegated to young children's entertainment, and writes of a,
    "soon-to-be emancipated 19th century Negress." What begins as a seemingly
    hopeful story of a free life written in the mode of a fairy tale quickly
    mimics her dark and provocative imagery. Freedom, A Fable, details the
    racial and sexual horrors experienced by African American women in the 19th
    century.

    and layered, Bouffant Pride is a mixed-media print composed in a grid-like
    structure that references a photography contact sheet. Inspired by
    advertisements in popular African American beauty magazines Ebony, Sepia,
    and Our World, Ellen Gallagher recast images that comment on mid-century
    Black beauty and cultural standards. The miniature portraits address the
    complex role hair plays in African American culture as means of personal
    expression and as a signifier of cultural identity and difference. Using
    Plasticine, toy eyeballs, paint, and ink, Gallagher exaggerated and
    transformed the images that once promoted aesthetic change to the magazine's
    reader and suggests means for personal revamping.

    University with a BFA degree. During her education at Howard, she refined
    her natural talents under the tutelage of lecturers such as Loïs Mailou

    on to earn an MFA from Montclair State University in 2005. Butler was a high
    school art teacher for ten years in the Newark Public Schools and three
    years at Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey. While obtaining her
    MFA, Butler took a Fiber Arts class where she had an artistic epiphany
    relating to how she expresses her art. "As a child, I was always watching my
    mother and grandmother sew, and they taught me. After that class, I made a
    portrait quilt for my grandmother on her deathbed, and I have been making
    art quilts ever since."<br><br>Butler's work was recently the focus of a

    not be in this program. All you're going to do is get married, get pregnant,
    have a baby and a good man could have been in your seat.' I'll never forget
    that moment. I was so humiliated and embarrassed because this was a public
    event. And of course what happened? When I graduated, I got pregnant.
    [Laughs] I was embarrassed. I couldn't celebrate the fact that I was having
    a kid. Recently, my son found a contact sheet with photographs of my
    pregnant belly and he said, 'mom, you never printed these.' I remembered
    this story. What I realized in terms of flipping the script, was that I made
    space for a good man, by having my son, who is a photographer. Flipping that
    into positive energy and still creating work." Martha St. Jean, "A Portrait

  TYPESET: >-
    Lithograph, screenprint and rubber stamp on Somerset paper, 2013. 600x800
    mm; 23⅝x31½ inches. Edition of 100. Signed, titled, dated and numbered in
    ink on the certificate of authenticity. Published by Whitechapel Gallery,
    London.<br><br>For the group show Spirit of Utopia at the Whitechapel
    Gallery, July - September 2013, Theaster Gates created a studio for making
    pottery, training apprentices, and investigating skill, teaching, and craft.
    Bitch, I Made this Pot is a wryly emblematic commentary by Gates on the
    subject of artistic authorship. This work obliquely references the longtime
    use by American collectors and scholars of the name, "Dave the Slave" for
    the 19th-century African American potter David Drake.
