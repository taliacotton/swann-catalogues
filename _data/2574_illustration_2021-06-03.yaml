    Illustration published in <i>Micawber</i> by John Lithgow (New York: Simon &

    <br><br>Provenance: Acquired by current owner from Storyopolis, April 2006.
    <br><br>In his third children's book, award-winning actor and best-selling
    author John Lithgow tells the tale of Micawber, a creative squirrel who
    lives in the Central Park Carousel and is a frequent visitor to the
    neighboring Metropolitan Museum of Art. One day as he peers through the
    window, he observes an artist in the gallery copying the old masters.
    Inspired and eager to try it himself, Micawber leaps into the artist's paint
    box as she leaves the Museum and hides in the apartment until she falls
    asleep. Borrowing the paints and using the tip of his bushy tail as a brush,
    Micawber surreptitiously discovers the joy of painting his own masterpieces.
    Night after night, he returns to the artist's apartment to paint. At dawn,
    he rolls up his canvas, ties it with a shoelace, and heads home to the park.
    Eventually, he has enough of his own paintings to open "Micawber's Museum of
    Art" in his living room at the top of the carousel, where he invites his
    fellow creatures of Central Park to admire his creations. In this
    illustration, Micawber imitates Norman Rockwell's iconic <i>Triple
    self-portrait</i>.<br><br>C. F. Payne illustrated Lithgow's <i>The
    Remarkable Farkle McBride</i> in addition to other books for children. His
    illustrations have regularly appeared in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> and
    <i>Time</i>.

    the signature image used in all the publicity for <i>Der Spiegel's</i>
    traveling exhibition titled “Die Kunst des Spiegel” (The Art of Der

    <br><br>Bralds, a mostly self-taught artist from the Netherlands, has been a
    prolific and sought-after illustrator for several decades. He was launched
    into fame beginning in 1978 when he received his first commission with a
    cover for <i>TIME</i> magazine soon followed by his indelible image of the
    proud Morgaine on horseback gracing the cover of <i>The Mists of Avalon,</i>
    Marion Zimmer Bradley's 1983 women-focused historical fiction bestseller
    about Arthurian legends. Bralds' impressive client list includes such
    notable publications as <i>Newsweek, Omni Magazine, The Washington Post,
    Rolling Stone, Atlantic Monthly, Esquire, Playboy, Penthouse, National
    Geographic,</i> and more. His work has been featured in ad campaigns for
    Alfa Romeo, Atlantic Records, Grand Marnier, Gucci, IBM International,
    Kahlua, Levi-Strauss, Pirelli Brazil, among others. <br>He has designed
    three stamp issues for the United Nations Postal Service and the United
    States Postal Service. In the late 1990s, Bralds transitioned to a fine art
    career, displaying his work in exhibits and galleries throughout the world.
    <br> A long list of awards includes a Hall of Fame recognition from the
    Dutch Society of Illustrators, an Andy Award, and a Clio Award. From The
    Society of Illustrators, he has won several medals, the coveted Hamilton
    King Award in 1984 and, just this spring of 2021, was inducted into their
    prestigious Hall of Fame.

    emotionally charged cover story concerning the demise of the biological
    family that is closer to Homo sapiens than any other form of life and whose

    decades ago, often accompanying her husband, Dale DeGroff, the James Beard
    award-winning mixologist and author of <i>The Craft of the Cocktail</i> (and
    its recent update <i>The New Craft of the Cocktail</i>) and with whom she
    co-founded the Museum of the American Cocktail in New Orleans in 2004.  Her
    book, <i>Lush Life Portraits from the Bar,</i> (New York, 2009) is an
    anthology of the colorful characters she met in bars around the world and
    the tales they told. <br><br>This painting captures the spirit of the
    legendary speakeasy-turned-landmark restaurant that opened its doors at 21
    West 52nd Street in 1929 and was famous for its 35 colorful jockey
    sculptures that lined its entrance.  One of the city's most celebrated hot
    spots of the pre- and post-Prohibition eras, its regulars included Ernest
    Hemingway, Mae West,  Mayor Jimmy Walker, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Crawford,
    and was a must-visit stop for every presidential candidate beginning with
    FDR. <br> During Prohibition, it was equipped with an elaborate system of
    levers that were used to tip the shelves of the bar, sweeping the liquor
    bottles through a chute leading into the city's sewers and reserved a
    private bar in the basement for Mayor Walker that included a secret wine
    cellar accessible only through a hidden door disguised as a brick wall that
    opened into the basement of the adjacent building. Though closed
    indefinitely during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, its current owners, the
    French luxury firm conglomerate LVMH, announced they are planning to reopen
    "21" at some point in a new, reimagined form with a nod to its distinctive

    this portrait caricature based on a photograph by Mitchell's wife, Therese,
    DeGroff remembers the famous literary chronicler of New York City's

    Seaport fish restaurant was located in the former Fulton Ferry Hotel.
    Mitchell immortilized Sloppy Louie's and its owner, his friend Louis Morini,
    in his famous work <i>Up in the Old Hotel</i> (1952). In the artist's
    words:  "To better understand the world, Joe followed the working hands; the
    folks who were an integral part of the sea's after-life, be it working the
    Fulton Fish Market, preparing food from it, or just being in it day after
    day, year after year . . . he needed to stay connected to this rapidly
    disappearing world. His glory was to get up close to humanity, to `Get in

    in fashion and performing arts began in the 1950s where, after serving in
    the Italian Campaign in World War II, and completing studies at The Art
    Students League on the GI Bill, he was launched into the fashion world as
    the head illustrator for <i>The New York Herald Tribune</i> under Eugenia
    Sheppard. Soon to follow were positions at <i>The London Sunday Times,
    American Vogue, The New York Times,</i> and Italian <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>
    where he famously covered Yves Saint Laurent's first and last collections
    (1958 and 2002). However, it is as Halston's Creative Director throughout
    the 1970s that he is best remembered. That time was recently chronicled in
    the popular Netflix series "Halston" in which Eula is skilfully portrayed by
    actor David Pittu who was nominated for a Tony Award for the role.

  year: '1976'
  TYPESET: >-
    Group of 16 illustrations plus the printed prospectus for Samuel Beckett's
    <i>All Strange Away</i> (New York: Gotham Book Mart, 1976).  Pen and ink on
    paper. 35x35 mm; 1¼x1¼ inches. All but two of the drawings loose from
    Gorey's paper mounts, measuring 6½x7¾ inches (where he has written "Top" in
    pencil along top margins). <br><br>Provenance: Archives of the printer,
    Oliphant Press. <br><br><i>All Strange Away</i> was printed in a signed,
    limited edition of 200 numbered and 26 lettered (A to Z) copies and was the
    first of two collaborations between Beckett and Gorey. It was followed by
    <i>Beginning to End</i> in 1988 which suffered numerous setbacks, mainly due
    to the author's failing health and was produced less than a year before
    Beckett's death. <br>Gorey was attracted to Beckett's absurdist prose and
    minimalist style, making his own aesthetic a perfect fit for the story which
    centers around an atmosphere of minimal space and light, beautifully
    mirrored in the book's layout which floats his eerie, microscopic views in
    the wide margins. These miniature postage-sized drawings are breathtaking in
    their detail and composition, once again proving Gorey's skill as an adept
    and versatile master of penwork.  <br><br>Note: for the purposes of the
    photographs in this sale, we have reconstructed the original placement as
    best we could, using the patterns of the dried adhesive as ghosted onto the
    mounts.

  DESCRIPT: THEODOOR VAN HOYTEMA (1863-1917)

  TYPESET: >-
    Illustration intended for the first English edition of <i>The Ugly
    Duckling</i> by Hans Christian Andersen with illustrations by Hoytema
    (Amsterdam: C. M. Van Gogh, 1896). Ink and watercolor on paper. 245x180 mm;
    9½x7 inches, on 11x7½-inch sheet. Signed "T. van Hoytema" in lower left
    margin. Circa 1894. Cornered to board with matte; framed.<br><br>The full
    caption reads "But winter past [sic] away at last and spring came back, and
    with spring the beautiful white birds." Hoytema first created this drawing
    for his first Dutch edition of Andersen's <i>The Ugly Duckling,</i>
    (published as <i>Het leelijke jonge Eendje</i> in 1893) and his breakthrough
    picture book. It shows the ugly duckling discovering that it is a handsome
    swan and joining the other birds in flight. The image reflects Hoytema's
    love of natural history, especially birds, and displays his skill of
    integrating his ornamental, stylized Art Nouveau imagery with text. This
    format and style allowed him to achieve a mastery of color lithography for
    both his picture books and a series of calendars produced between 1900 and
    1917, for which he is generally best known.

    As titled on opening page of a personal sketchbook created by Marshall
    during his time at The New England Conservatory of Music and gifted to his
    high school friend.  Single unbound Quaker Artist Tablet containing 22
    numbered full-page watercolor and ink drawings, some mounted, others drawn
    directly onto the page, a final sheet ("the end / Love, J"). Notebook
    measures 253x350 mm; 10x14 inches, drawings vary in size; spine perished,
    but contents seem to be complete, cover signed "Marshall / 78 Gainsboro 3A

    titled, inscribed, and signed by Marshall: "Aesop / Kenneth, this is the one
    about the blackbird who disguises himself to enter the beauty contest. The
    old fool. Jim." 5¼x4½ inches, image, on 9x8¼-inch paper, laid into notebook.
    <br><br>Provenance: Kenneth Marshall; gift of the artist to friend Kenneth
    Maples; private collection, San Antonio, Texas. <br><br>A thoroughly
    charming sketchbook by beloved children's book author and creator of the
    famous "George and Martha" series of books about the friendship and
    adventures of a witty hippopotamus couple. <br><br>Created for a close
    friend from his early years in San Antonio, presumably before Marshall
    planned a trip to Europe, the humorous drawings feature scenes in classic
    Boston area locations including the MFA, New England Conservatory,
    Locke-Ober, Gainsboro Street,  The Bar of the Other Side on Charles Street,
    Hayes-Bickford's, The English Tea Room, Newbury Street, and Aladdin's Cave.
    Some drawings include his bulldog Irene (whom he often featured in his
    books), two self-portraits, and other curious animals and characters whose
    physical details nod to the style and types he would develop in his later
    work. <br>Marshall attended The New England Conservatory of Music where he
    studied viola until a nerve damage in his hand caused him to leave. Not long
    after switching studies and graduating from Southern Connecticut State
    College in 1967, he began working as a freelance author and illustrator, and
    his first book for children, "Plink, Plink, Plink" by Byrd Baylor was
    published in 1970.  Although he had no formal art training, Marshall
    illustrated more than 70 books before he died at the early age of 50 from
    AIDS-related causes. In 2007 the American Library Association posthumously
    awarded him the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal for a "substantial and lasting
    contribution" to American children's literature.

    Mayor Jimmy Walker, Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, Herbert Bayard Swope, Jesse
    Jones, Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson, Christopher Morley, Jean Hersholt, and
    many others. <br><br>A wonderful group of illustrated posters from the early
    meetings of the charitable association founded in 1926 and still active
    today. The group’s name serves as a metaphor, with the members, due to their
    human imperfections, representing “sinners,” who strive to be “saints” of
    mercy by helping those in need. The club’s origins date back to 1926 when a
    small group of circus enthusiasts in New York City founded the Circus Fans
    Association of America, providing aid to retired circus performers in need
    of financial assistance. In 1929, several members resigned and formed the
    Circus Saints and Sinners Club of America. Over the decades, they have
    evolved into a modern, nonprofit philanthropic organization. <br><br>Steinke
    was an accomplished American painter, portraitist, illustrator, graphic
    designer and muralist. Early in her career, she worked for the National
    Broadcasting Company where she painted portraits of the NBC Orchestra
    including Arturo Toscanini and Ignace Paderewski, now both in the permanent
    collection of the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.. During
    World War II, she worked for the U.S. War Department, painting the portraits
    of major American figures such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D.
    Eisenhower, and Generals Henry "Hap" Arnold and Douglas MacArthur. She was
    given the John Singer Sargent Award for Lifetime Achievement by the Society
    of Portrait Artists and honored by the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and
    National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum for her work featuring American
    Indians and the West to which she devoted the later decades of her life.

  TYPESET: >-
    Includes costume designs for New York City Ballet productions "Dances at a
    Gathering" and "The Goldberg Variations" 1969-1971. The group comprises over
    60 illustrations, from rough to finished, many with his manuscript notes, in
    a number of media including graphite, ink, watercolor, chalk, and color
    pencil. Some contain fabric swatches pinned to production notes and
    sketches. Sizes vary, but many most on 8x10-inch or 9x12-inch sheets or
    larger, many are cut from those or larger sheets; the majority (roughly 40)
    are laid into the sleeves of a ring binder; 13 are mounted to display boards
    and shrink-wrapped with display mounting hooks on verso.<br><br>Eula's long
    and prolific career in fashion and performing arts began in the 1950s where,
    after serving in the Italian Campaign in World War II and completing studies
    at The Art Students League on the GI Bill, he was launched into the fashion
    world as the head illustrator for <i>The New York Herald Tribune</i> under
    Eugenia Sheppard. Soon to follow were positions at <i>The London Sunday
    Times, American Vogue, The New York Times,</i> and Italian <i>Harper's
    Bazaar</i> where he famously covered Yves Saint Laurent's first and last
    collections (1958 and 2002). However, it is as Halston's Creative Director
    throughout the 1970s that he is best remembered. That time was recently
    chronicled in the popular Netflix series "Halston" in which Eula is
    skilfully portrayed by actor David Pittu who was nominated for a Tony Award
    for the role.<br><br>Eula made considerable contributions to the world of
    dance and theater; these detailed, thoughtful designs for Robbins'
    masterworks, for which he designed both sets and costumes, exemplify his
    genius for line, color, and form.

    26 original scenic concept designs for the Tony Award-winning Broadway
    musical that premiered at The St. James Theatre May 1, 1983.  Collage,
    colorade paper, and photographic reproduction. 216x254 mm; 8½x10 inches,
    mounted to 14x17-inch sheets. Laid into artist's signed board portfolio
    case. <br><br><i>My One and Only</i> was the breakthrough production for
    Lobel, the award-winning American scenic designer and producer for theatre,
    opera, and dance, and a fine artist. <br>Her bright, graphic sets based upon
    Russian Constructivist art perfectly set the stage for the hit musical
    starring Tommy Tune and Twiggy, based on the book by Peter Stone and Timothy
    S. Mayer and featuring music and lyrics by the Gershwin brothers. <br>The
    show's road to success was fraught with controversy, having suffered
    difficult out-of-town tryouts in Boston which resulted in most of the
    original creative team being fired, including its original director, Peter
    Sellars, along with Tim Mayer, the musical director and arranger, and Lobel.
    While Tommy Tune nominally took over the direction with his co-director /
    -choreographer Thommie Walsh, Lobel's contribution was deemed too integral
    to the production and her work was kept largely unaltered. The show became
    one of the most celebrated musicals of the decade and ran for 767
    performances through March 3, 1985. <br><br>Lobel has designed sets for
    Broadway, off-Broadway, and metropolitan and regional theater productions
    worldwide, including the Metropolitan Opera, Le Chatelet, The Royal National
    Theater, BAM, the Yale Repertory Theatre, Théatre Royal de la Monnai, New
    York City Opera, SUNY Purchase, and Central Park's Delacorte Theater.  Her
    prolific work for the Mark Morris Dance Group is widely acclaimed. Many of
    her stage maquettes and designs are housed in the permanent collection of
    the McNay Art Museum, San Antonio, Texas, including those for the Houston
    Grand Opera productions of "Nixon in China" and "Street Scene." In 2002 she
    produced and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical for "A Year
    With Frog and Toad" based upon the famous children's books by her late
    father, Arnold Lobel, whom she credits for instilling much of her work ethic
    and love of art.

    33 original scenic concept designs for the award-winning 1988 modern dance

    masterpiece of modern dance set to Handel's 1740 Baroque oratorio
    "L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato" which draws from Milton's 1645
    poems. <br><br>A major element of L'Allegro's magic was Lobel's set designs
    which brilliantly captured its mood and movement. Rather than illustrate the
    verses literally - which would have been impossible - she opted for a more
    abstract approach inspired by the paintings of Josef Albers and Mark Rothko
    to properly express its non-linear narrative.<br><br>Inspired by their color
    field works, she created solid and geometric panels that were transferred
    onto movable translucent and opaque scrims. These could be changed in a
    matter of moments to suit the shallow and deep spaces that the scenes
    required, move precisely with the music, and draw the mood and emotional
    responses those changes were intended to evoke. These designs showcase her
    masterly command of color, texture, composition, and stage mechanics.
    Ultimately, they reveal the creative process of this skilled female artist
    who produced one of the most visually stunning and enduring works of modern
    stage design.<br><br>Lobel has designed sets for Broadway, off-Broadway, and

  TYPESET: >-
    Group of 19 original scenic concept designs for the 2005 Metropolitan Opera
    adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's play composed by Tobias Picker, libretto by
    Gene Scheer, and directed by Francesca Zambello.  Graphite, ink, and
    collaged reproductions of photographs on paper, numbered in lower right. 
    356x432 mm; 14x17 inches, sheets. Unsigned, but with Lobel's notations in
    the margins.<br><br>Dreiser's novel was inspired by the true events of a
    sensational murder trial that took place in the Adirondacks in 1906 where a
    reckless young man was accused and sent to the electric chair for the murder
    of his pregnant girlfriend. <br>To reflect the various locations and
    emotional intensity of the scenes, Lobel researched on location. She took a
    trip to region and photographed the locations where the murder unfolded and
    read the letters that the real-life woman, Grace Brown (upon whom the play's
    character, Roberta, was based) wrote to her lover, Clyde, begging him to
    marry her while he was running around with a high society girl he planned to
    leave her for. The result was a series of rough collages with the photos she
    took, creating a multi-level set that could allow split-screen scenes to
    happen simultaneously. Its success prompted accolades by critic Martin
    Bernheimer who wrote in the February 2006 issue of Opera (UK): "Adrianne
    Lobel's ingenious set, sensitively lit by James F. Ingalls, accommodated the
    fluid action on three tiers, austere vignettes appearing and disappearing
    behind sliding panels." <br><br>Lobel has designed sets for Broadway,

    Signed "Hirschfeld/Boston/ 5" in ink, lower right.  Nested into recessed
    foam support; raw silk-covered matte and plain mahogany wood frame, Feiden
    Galleries label retained on original brown paper backing (now removed and
    folded, but included with lot).<br><br>Provenance: Margo Feiden Gallery;
    Kyle Renick, Artistic Director of the WPA Theatre, New York; private
    collection, New York.<br><br><i>Private Lives,</i> short-lived but popular,
    due to its star appeal, opened on May 8th, 1983 and ran for 63 performances
    through July 17th. Hirschfeld perfectly captures the actors' grand
    personalities and dramatic style, still in full force in their mature
    careers. His graphite under-sketching, evident throughout, but mostly where
    he aims to render Ms. Taylor's bold head tilt, is faint but still visible
    and offers a glimpse into his artistic desire to craft the perfect
    composition.<br><br>Taylor was a great fan of Hirschfeld. She owned the cast
    drawing of her 1981 performance in "Little Foxes." The admiration was
    mutual: the artist drew her twenty times over the course of 56 years and
    inscribed many books to her.<br><br>David Leopold, Creative Director of the
    Al Hirschfeld Foundation, remarked that this work is notable because it was
    likely the last time Hirschfeld drew the same stage production for different
    papers. That practice was quite common up until 1943 when he was appearing
    regularly in at least three different New York City newspapers, but ended
    soon after. "Private Lives" appeared to be a later one-time exception when
    he drew the play for the <i>The New York Times</i> and a different but
    similarly composed version for the <i>London Daily Mail.</i>
