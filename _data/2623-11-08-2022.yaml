    created two and three dimentional works. Her earliest use of parchent is
    documented in a 1974 publication, Van Wagner, Judith K., GEOMETRIC
    ABSTRACTION. Sheldon Museum of Art Catalogues and Publications. Here van
    Wagner states, She used parchement in 1941. In Pereira's own words, she
    describes her use of various materials as follows: I employ the abstract
    idiom in painting rather than more traditional forms of expression because
    it offers me a wider range for experimentation. In these pictures I have
    endeavored to explore the formal possibilities of painting, with special
    emphasis on constructional ways of expressing space and experimenting with
    new use of materials, such as glass and parchment and new pigments.

    painted many colorful landscapes around the sunny hills of this picturesque
    medieval town. This large watercolor typifies her postwar approach to
    landscape. Cabris is a picturesque village in the Alpes-Maritimes department
    of southeastern France, and was the hometown of her close friend Céline
    Tabary. Jones first visited the town in 1937 during her first year of
    studies in Paris, and returned numerous times over a period of some 50
    years. Jones and her husband Pierre-Noël also were married there in 1953.

    Bill Hodges Gallery, New York, with the label on the frame back; private

    example of the mid-career work of Richard Dempsey. In 1951, Dempsey became
    associated with the Washington, DC color field school with his inclusion in
    the first Annual Exhibition of the Loïs Mailou Jones & Céline Tabary Studio
    Group. Alongside Delilah Pierce and Alma Thomas, Dempsey showed at the
    Barnett-Aden Gallery in Washington, DC through the 1950s. These watercolors
    are organic abstractions of the local color and scenery that Dempsey
    encountered on his travels to Haiti, Jamaica, and North Carolina in the late
    1950s. His work today is found in the Atlanta University Collection of
    Afro-American Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Harriet and
    Harmon Kelly Collection of African American Art, San Antonio.

    W. Thomas: Everything is Beautiful, 2021, p. 202.<br><br>Reflections is a
    beautiful and important early abstraction by Alma Thomas, painted at the
    cusp of her brilliant painting career. In 1960, Thomas had just resigned
    from her position at Shaw Junior High School, ending a thirty five year art
    teaching career, beginning a full-time dedication to painting at the age of
    69. Thomas had been painting for decades prior - developing a body of work
    from modernist portraits and still lifes towards abstraction in the late
    1950s. This painting shows Thomas's embrace of abstraction by 1963, and the
    rich inspiration she found in nature - interests that would continue over
    the next nineteen years. Reflections's inclusion in both her first and most
    recent retrospectives, the 1966 Howard University exhibition and the 2021-22
    traveling exhibition at Alma W. Thomas: Everything is Beautiful, organized
    by curators Seth Feman and Jonathan Frederick Walz, signifies this work's
    significance and how it defines this important formative period of Thomas's
    practice.<br><br>Reflections's modernist composition is an excellent
    representative of Thomas's abstract painting from the early 1960s. Her
    abstractions from nature at this moment are characterized by saturated blue
    or red colors and punctuated by rapid brushstrokes and "scraffito" or
    palette knife markings. This elegant composition is centered on a
    representation of color and light reflected in a river or pond, but is also
    punctuated with passages of early fall colors and suggestions of branches at
    the edges. Thomas had an affinity with the deep hue of ultramarine blue.
    Several paintings of the period, from The Stormy Sea, 1958, collection of
    the Smithsonian American Art Museum to Blue Abstraction, 1961, Howard
    University Gallery of Art are centered on this expressive
    color.<br><br>Reflections is also an important precursor to Thomas's later
    body of work centered on reflections found in nature. In 1964, this period
    of painting was interrupted by a severe attack of arthritis--an interval
    that led to her "mature" style and first retrospective at Howard University
    in 1966. Alma Thomas achieved unparalleled critical success and national
    public recognition in 1972 with her solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of
    American Art, a first for an African American woman. Her interest in natural
    reflections of color continues in such later works as Late Night
    Reflections, 1972, the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, Pond -
    Spring Awakening, 1972, the Akron Art Museum and Snow Reflections on Pond,
    1973, Smithsonian American Art Museum.<br><br>.
