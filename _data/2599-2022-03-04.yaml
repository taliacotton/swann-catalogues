    mm; 16x13x8 inches, not including the base. Cast in the 1980s. Incised with
    the maker's cypher, "5" and "©" at the rear lower

    the Museum of African American Art, Tampa, FL and the Florida Education
    Fund, another cast, p. 26.<br><br>This handsome bust is a posthumous work
    made when director Adolphus Ealey had bronze casts fabricated after works in
    the Barnett Aden collection - it was not cast from an original mold. Other
    similar casts of   Slave Boy  are in the collections of the Pennsylvania
    Academy of the Fine Arts, the Kinsey African American Art Collection and the
    William C. Robinson Family Collection.<br><br>May Howard Jackson is one of
    the earliest African American female artists, alongside Edmonia Lewis (c.
    1843 - 1912) and Meta Warrick Vaux Fuller (1877 - 1968). Born in the same
    year, Jackson and Fuller both came from privileged families that embraced
    fine art and studied at the Pennsylvania Museum School as well as the
    Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Jackson won a scholarship to attend
    in 1895, the year before Fuller - becoming the first African American woman
    to attend. She married in 1902, and moved to Washington, DC, establishing a
    studio there and exhibiting at the Corcoran Gallery. In 1912, she exhibited
    busts of F. J. Reverend Grimke and W. E. B. Du Bois at the Verhoof Galleries
    in Washington, DC, which received critical acclaim. Nevertheless, she was
    rejected by the Washington Society of Fine Arts and the National Academy of
    Design. She later joined the faculty at Howard University, where she taught
    with James A. Porter, and continued to exhibit her artwork at the Harmon
    Foundation and the Barnett-Aden Gallery. Farrington pp. 72-74; St. James p.

    Community Art Center in 1940. While cleaning out their building's basement,
    she found this sculpture abandoned at 3831 S Michigan Avenue. Previously,
    the home was built in 1892 for George A. Seaverns, Jr. and his family. In
    the early 20th century, as wealthy white families moved away, the grand
    house was eventually converted into apartments in the now African American
    neighborhood.<br><br>Illustrated: Samella Lewis,   Barthé: His Life in Art

    1931.<br><br>Exhibited:   An Exhibition of Portraits and Sculpture by
    Richmond Barthé , The Woman’s City Club, Chicago, June 7 - 21, 1930. This

    Crab Man ,   Blackberry Woman ,   Black Narcissus ,   West Indian Venus 
    and   Breakaway . Exhibition of the   Work of Negro Artists , the Harmon
    Foundation, New York, February 16 - 28, 1931.   Boy with a Broom  was one of
    five artworks by Barthé in his second showing at the Harmon Foundation; The
    Wisconsin Union, University of Wisconsin, April 7 - May 1, 1931. It included
    17 artworks; one sold for $50; Women’s City Club, 22 Park Ave, New York,
    June 7 - 21, 1931. It included   Boy With a Broom  along with several others
    from the earlier Harmon Foundation exhibition.<br><br>  Boy with a Broom  is
    an exciting discovery - an extremely scarce example of a large plaster
    sculpture surviving from Richmond Barthé's early career. Most of the early
    plaster works from Barthé's first two Harmon Foundation exhibitions, like  
    West Indian Girl , 1929 are only known today from reproductions. In 1928,
    Barthé also made a series of historical African American figures in busts
    including Henry Ossawa Tanner and Touissant L'Ouverture; from this series,  
    Paul Laurence Dunbar  and   Booker T. Washington  are now in the collection
    of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. This charming, life-size portrait was
    likely made in New York as Barthé arrived in Harlem in February of 1929 and
    did not return to Chicago until the summer of 1930. While Barthé was the
    toast of the town in Harlem, he was also preparing for his first solo
    exhibition sponsored by the Woman's City Club of Chicago planned for June of
    1930. He brought back to Chicago 24 sculptures, six oil paintings and eight
    drawings, including   Boy with a Broom . It was such a success that soon
    after Barthé successfully applied for a Rosenwald Foundation scholarship to
    return to New York.<br><br>We would like to thank art historian and Barthé
    expert Margaret Rose Vendryes for sharing her notes detailing the
    sculpture's exhibition history. Vendryes pp 39-46; Schulman p. 84.

  TYPESET: '  Untitled (Man with Child Holding Basket) .'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Oil on linen canvas, circa 1931. 768x508 mm; 30¼x20 inches. Signed and dated
    in oil, lower left.<br><br>Provenance: the estate of Claude A. Barnett and
    Etta Moten Barnett, Chicago. Etta Moten Barnett (1901 – 2004) was a popular
    African American actress and vocalist, who was best known for her signature
    role of Bess in   Porgy and Bess . She married Claude Albert Barnett (1889 –
    1967) in 1934. Barnett was an influential and trailblazing national figure -
    an important media entrepreneur, journalist and one of the principal
    organizers of the Chicago Negro Expositon in 1940. Barnett is also known as
    the founder of the Associated Negro Press in 1919, the first Black news
    service in the country, connecting Black newspapers across the country.
    <br><br>This depiction of a Haitian man and a boy crossing a street is a
    beautiful and scarce example from William Edouard Scott's early Haitian
    period. Scott, born in Indianapolis, trained at the Art Institute of Chicago
    from 1904-09. After winning several painting scholarships and awards at the
    Institute, he travelled to Paris, where he studied with Henry Ossawa Tanner
    and enrolled at the Académie Julian. When he returned in 1912, he received
    many mural commissions, including for the Chicago World's Fair of 1933 and
    for the Federal Art Project of the WPA in Chicago. While Scott's time in
    Paris had a profound effect on his early work, the year Scott spent in Haiti
    shaped the rest of his career.<br><br>Scott was awarded a Julius Rosenwald
    Foundation scholarship in 1931 to study and paint the African beliefs and
    customs that had survived in the culture of this independent island nation.
    Scott left for Haiti that year, and did many   plein air  sketches around
    the docks and streets of the capitol city Port-au-Prince. These studies were
    later translated into larger canvases in the artist's rooftop studio of the
    Excelsior Hotel in Port-au-Prince. With his extensive experience painting
    murals, Scott specialized in large multi-figure scenes, but painted moving
    portraits as well. Others include   Blind Sister Mary  and   Kenskoff, Haiti
    , both circa 1931, collection of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black
    Culture, the New York Public Library. Schulman p. 86; Taylor/Warkel figs.

    margin.<br><br>Born in Atlanta, Georgia, printmaker and designer Wilmer
    Jennings attended Morehouse College and studied under Hale Woodruff, who
    introduced him to the principles of modernism. Under the Graphic Arts
    Division of the WPA in 1934, they worked together on two notable murals that
    represented the African American experience:   The Negro in Modern American
    Life: Agriculture and Rural Life, Literature, Music, and Art  and   The
    Dream . Unfortunately, both murals were destroyed.<br><br>After graduating
    from Morehouse College, Jennings moved to New England to attend the Rhode
    Island School of Design (1933). Hired by the Rhode Island WPA in 1935, he
    created works that portrayed the economic hardships of African Americans
    during the Depression. The subjects of his later work included landscape and
    social realist scenes of his community. After injuring his right hand in
    1957, Jennings began to train himself to draw and paint left-handed, which
    he continued to do up until the time of his death. Wilmer Jennings's artwork
    is in the permanent collections of the Rhode Island School of Design Art
    Museum and The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

    first photo job was as an assistant to photographer Maceo Sheffield. She was
    hired as a staff photographer for the   California Eagle in 1945, where she
    was a pioneer among both female and African American photographers,
    capturing both the glamour of Black celebrities and the stirrings of the
    civil rights movement after World War II. She later worked with publisher
    Charlotta Bass, a leader in the Los Angeles civil rights movement,

    work, and she left the newspaper to pursue higher education. Jackson
    received her BA in education in 1952 at the University of California at Los
    Angeles and her MA in 1954 from the University of Southern California. For
    more than twenty years, she was an educator with the Los Angeles School

    and Leonard Hicks, New York (1960s); thence by descent, private collection,
    Vermont.<br><br>This beautiful, modernist composition is an important early
    abstraction by Norman Lewis. This large canvas displays the artist's deep
    investigation of the dark tonalities and form found in the curled leaves of
    rhododendrons. The painting represents a significant moment, the confluence
    of Lewis's interest in modernism, black paint and natural forms that
    characterize his earliest abstract period and on a grand
    scale.<br><br>Reflecting his great love of plants, of which he kept many in
    his studio, Lewis drew and painted several images of the leaves of
    rhododendron plants hanging down in the cold of winter. In 1948, Lewis
    painted the vertical and tonal composition   Rhododendrons in Winter , in
    the Mott/Warsh Collection, which he later included in his first solo
    exhibition at the Willard Gallery in 1949. Another almost identical but
    smaller (18x24 inches) painting   Three in Spades 1948, is recorded with a
    photograph in the estate of the artist. Illustrated in the catalogue  
    Norman Lewis: Black Paintings, 1946-1977 , Ann Gibson used this image in her
    essay   Black is a Color: Norman Lewis and Modernism in New York  to
    illustrate how Lewis's interest in the color black began. It goes back to
    his painting of rhododenrons; according to Lewis, it "started with some
    rhodendrons...which I painted. I used just black - to convey the form - and
    I liked that and I went on to try to do other things". Lewis continued to
    use black and a dark palette through the 1940s to define his abstract forms.
    In   Untitled  and   City Night , two 1949 paintings in the collection of
    the Musuem of Modern Art, Lewis creates a similar dark silhouette around the
    central image;   Untitled  shares this earthy palette of greens and greys.

    Tempera on cream wove paper, mounted to board, 1954. 724x559 mm; 28½x22
    inches. Signed and dated in pencil, lower left.<br><br>Provenance: acquired
    directly from the artist; George W. Crockett, Jr. and Ethelene J. Crockett,
    MD (1954), Detroit, Michigan; thence by descent, private collection,
    Virginia. The Crocketts were close friends of Elizabeth Catlett and
    Francisco Mora, and acquired this portrait during a visit to Mexico City.
    Catlett also drew a large portrait of Ethelene Crockett in pencil in
    1958.<br><br>George William Crockett, Jr. (1909 - 1997) was an African
    American attorney, jurist, and congressman from Michigan. He also served as
    a national vice-president of the National Lawyers Guild and co-founded what
    is believed to be the first racially integrated law firm in the United
    States.<br><br>Dr. Ethelene Jones Crockett (1914 - 1978) was a physician and
    community activist. She was Michigan's first African American female board
    certified OB/GYN, the first woman to be president of the American Lung
    Association, and inducted posthumously into the Michigan Women's Hall of
    Fame.<br><br>This significant, modern portrait of a young woman is a scarce
    example of mid-century painting by Elizabeth Catlett. Most of Catlett's
    paintings, of which only about a dozen are recorded today, are portraits in
    oil or tempera from her 1940s New York period. This work is part of the
    artist's important body of work exploring the representation of African
    American women. This large image shows Catlett's transition in her
    figuration from the modernist stylization of the late 1940s to realism in
    the early 1950s.<br><br>The painting was made at an important juncture in
    her career, during a period of great production as a member of the Taller de
    Gráfica Popular. Catlett produced a large body of graphic work - taking a
    break from her sculpture while raising her young family of three sons. She
    first exhibited her linoleum cut   Sharecropper  in 1951 in Atlanta. Between
    1953-54, Catlett created a series of a dozen linoleum cuts of African
    American heroes and heroines from Crispus Attucks to Paul Robeson. She then
    returned to making sculpture in 1955.

    this early portrayal of a Black man in service of his nation is poised with
    confidence and cool. Depicted in rich hues of green, yellow, and red during
    a period when there were few African American soldiers in military service,
    Cromartie paints this figure to illuminate society's selective memory and to
    remember the often missing narratives.<br><br>Robert Cromartie was born in
    Cumberland, South Carolina, in 1929, with his family later moving to West
    Philadelphia for improved living conditions. Cromartie completed his formal
    education in the Philadelphia Public School System, graduating from West
    Philadelphia High School. He pursued his love of art by studying the subject
    at the college level for two years. In 1951, Cromartie enlisted in the
    United States Army and was honorably discharged after two years of service.
    Following his military service, he worked for the U.S. Postal Service for
    many years. His true passion was art, and he opened Cromartie's Awards in
    West Philadelphia, at 60th and Chestnut Streets, where he would work on his
    art and teach the trade to his many apprentices. He married Myrtle Jones in
    1956 and painted in his spare time. While he mentored younger artists and
    traveled throughout Africa.

    York.<br><br>  The Chase  is an extraordinary and fascinating painting by
    Bob Thompson - an early oil from his breakout period in Provincetown. In the
    summer of 1958, Thompson spent time painting in Provincetown and taking
    classes at the Seong Moy School of Painting and Graphic Arts. There he began
    incorporating figurative elements to his abstract painting, and befriended
    fellow resident artists Emilio Cruz and Gandy Brodie. This brief period
    begins with the painting   The Funeral of Jan Müller , Thompson's homage to
    the influential German emigré artist whose work he encountered in
    Provincetown but who passed away shortly before Thompson arrived on the
    Cape. That summer, Thompson produced an expressive figurative body of work
    painted in oil in a dark sombre palette on masonite board. Many of his
    paintings were exhibited in the 1958 Provincetown Arts Festival sponsored by
    the Chrysler Museum, 13 of which were purchased by art benefactor Walter
    Chrylser.   The Funeral of Jan Müller , Myron Kunin Collection of American
    Art, Minneapolis Institute of Art, is featured in the current traveling

    technique of paint, gouache and collage.<br><br> By 1959, Middleton left the
    United States permanently, moving to Spain, Sweden, and then Denmark. While
    living in Copenhagen, Middleton joined many other American expat artists

    oil, lower right corner.<br><br>Provenance: estate of the artist; private
    collection, MA.<br><br>Born October 3, 1925, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Elaine
    Crossley was creative and intellectually curious. She began writing poetry
    before later taking up drawing and finally painting. Bound to her pragmatic
    parents, Crossley wanted to major in art and study at the Cincinnati Art
    Academy but was persuaded to pursue home economics at the University of
    Cincinnati, which she did, all the while continuing to draw and paint.
    Crossley took art courses at the Art Institute of Chicago while living in
    Chicago with her husband, Frank Crossley, from 1952 to 1966. He was a
    metallurgical engineer who minored in fine art himself and encouraged his
    partner's artistic interests. After moving to California, she studied
    ceramics and jewelry making.<br><br>Crossley's expressions explore
    composition, color, space, and balance. Her designs consist of geometric and
    architectural forms, or landscapes with sensuous, undulating shapes. Most
    are outlined in black; some are angry, playful, and humorous. Inspired by
    artists of previous generations, Crossley identified the core of her
    artwork:<br><br>“[It comes from an] ancient art form, originating in Sudan,
    and used in much of ceremonial and ritual design in African artifacts.
    Although I am often identified as a cubist, I consider my style very
    personal and unique—an expression of myself. As an abstract painter, I am
    strongly influenced by African geometric designs. Here I must explain that I
    did not ‘lift’ a style from Africa but extended the expression of an
    established form. Abstract art is prevalent in Oceanic art, the islands of
    the Pacific, where Black people remain today producing the same designs for
    wall coverings, clothing, fabrics, and crafts…We, as Black people, owe it to
    our posterity to salvage our culture. We can do this only by becoming
    informed about those things that depict us as a people. We must not limit
    our scope and eclipse our diverse and abundant contributions. I do not paint
    the Black experience. I am a Black woman who paints what she feels, thus
    expressing and sharing her Black experience."<br><br>After living in
    Illinois, the Crossleys relocated to Palo Alto, California, then to Granite
    Bay (near Sacramento) in 1986. She exhibited extensively in Californian
    venues including the Triton Museum, Santa Clara, Fine Arts Gallery, Mountain
    View, Arts Associates West, San Francisco, Berkeley Museum, the Center for
    the Visual Arts in Oakland, and the University of Indiana. Crossley was
    artist-in-residence at the Berkeley Plaza Gallery and the Ebony Museum of
    Art, both in Oakland, where her works were often on display over several
    decades. She lectured on art and exhibited at the University of
    California-Berkeley and in Sacramento. Butler, p. 30.

    is an excellent example of Hughie Lee-Smith's mid-career painting.  
    Aftermath  is a significant painting, and was part of one of the nation's
    most celebrated corporate collections of African American Art.<br><br> 
    Aftermath  epitomizes Lee-Smith's unique view of urban decay, a vision of a
    modern, existential landscape with Surrealist undertones. It appears closely
    related to his   Slum Lad , circa 1960, in the collection of the Flint
    Institute of Arts.   Aftermath  depicts the same background of a crumbling
    facade. The three bright pink and yellow balloons in the foreground suggest
    the recent presence of young people, alienation and a fleeting, fragile
    moment. Lee-Smith's fluttering flags and a distant city on the horizon
    further denote an empty space. Another similar untitled painting with a
    figure walking away from the viewer was sold at Swann Galleries on April 7,
    2016.<br><br>Lee-Smith returned often to show his work and teach in Detroit

    Maryland.<br><br>Sam Gilliam painted   First Season  in his first year
    living in Washington, DC. This figurative painting shows his transition
    towards abstraction, and is one of his earliest paintings to come to
    auction. Gilliam completed his MA in painting at the University of
    Louisville in 1961 where he befriended painter Kenneth Victor Young. At the
    time, Gilliam was drawn to Bay Area figurative paintings - in particular,
    Nathan Oliveira and David Park. Jonathan Binstock writes, "Bay Area
    figuration was important to him because it was abstract, or at least because
    it represented a way for him to further the abstract quotient in his own
    work". Oliveira's influence can be seen in this painting. In 1962, Gilliam
    moved to Washington, DC to marry   Washington Post  reporter Dorothy Butler.
    Upon the recommendation of James A. Porter, whom Gilliam had sought out for
    advice, he took a job teaching art at McKinley High School. The following
    year, Gilliam had his first one person exhibition at the Adams Morgan
    Gallery. Binstock pp. 8-12.

    Spirit of Resistance: African-American Modernists & the Mexican Muralist
    School , pl. 30, p. 119.<br><br>This modernist oil painting of an African
    American family in front of a city skyline is a large study for an
    unrealized mural project. As a result of his many mural commissions, Alston
    excelled at compositions that included multiple figures - from his
    celebrated 1936 WPA Harlem Hospital and 1949 Golden State Mutual Life
    Insurance Company murals to the lesser known 1957   Our Constitution  at
    City College of New York. This painting is similar in its composition to the
    Alston's 1964 mosaic mural   Man on the Threshold of Space  for the Harriet
    Tubman Junior High School, PS 154 in Harlem. By 1976, Alston completed two
    more mosaic murals,   Equal Justice Under the Law  and   The Family of Man ,
    for the Bronx County Family and Criminal Court buildings with more abstract
    figures.<br><br>The subject of this painting was also a familiar one to
    Alston at the time. It is part of a significant body of work, his series
    of   Family paintings, made in the late 1960s. Alston's important modern
    portrait   Family (Family #1)  in the collection of the Whitney Museum of
    American Art was painted in 1955. The next seven paintings in the series
    were painted between 1965-1968; Alston's   Family #3 , 1966 is also in this
    30x60 inch horizontal format.

    modern oil painting typifies the mid-career work of artist, illustrator and
    educator Earl Hill. Hill’s paintings from the 1960s emphasize the humanity
    of ordinary individuals, depicting their work and daily experiences. Born in
    New York in 1927, Hill spent much of his youth in Bells Mill, a small town
    in rural Virginia. He returned to New York to attend New York University,
    where he studied art with Hale Woodruff. He graduated in 1951 with a degree
    in education and went on to obtain his master’s degree from the City College
    of New York in 1960. Hill taught art appreciation in public schools in New
    York, Baltimore, and the Virgin Islands while continuing to study painting
    at a variety of institutions. Hill retired from teaching in 1984, a year
    before his death. His paintings are found in The Hewitt Collection of

    edge.<br><br>Provenance: private collection, New York.<br><br>This
    expressive figure of   Sojourner Truth  is a significant work by sculptor
    Inge Hardison. Despite a lengthy career as a sculptor and living to the age
    of 102, Hardison's work is not widely known today beyond her popular series
    of small cast busts of historical figures   Negro Giants in History  in 1963
    and   Ingenious Americans  in the late 1960s.<br><br>Born in Portsmouth, VA,
    Hardison's family moved to Brooklyn in the 1930s where she pursued many
    creative interests including acting and dance. Journalist Alice Bernstein in
    her article, "Inge Hardison at 100" in the   International Review of African
    American Art  wrote how after graduating from high school, Hardison landed a
    role in the 1936 Broadway production of   Sweet River , George Abbott’s
    adaptation of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, which won her rave reviews. Hardison also
    appeared in   The Country Wife  with Ruth Gordon, and in the 1946 production
    of   Anna Lucasta,  co-starring with Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee. She later
    attended Vassar College, majoring in music and creative writing, and later
    took art classes at the Arts Students League in New York. She also taught
    with Victor Lowenfeld at Hampton University from 1955-46.<br><br>Hardison
    made a wide range of figurative sculptures including several large public
    works such as the life-size 1957 bronze   Mother and Child  at Mt. Sinai
    Hospital in Manhattan and the 7-foot abstract figure   Jubilee  at Medgar
    Evers College in Brooklyn. Hardison was the only woman founding member of
    the Black Academy of Arts and Letters (BAAL), an African American cultural
    organization created in 1969 for the preservation and promotion of Black
    culture.<br><br>The original sculpture of   Sojourner Truth was presented to
    Nelson Mandela by New York Governor Mario Cuomo in 1990. Other casts of this
    work are in the collection of the New York State Harlem Art Collection and
    the Belmont-Paul Women’s Equality National Monument of the National Woman's
    Party, Washington, DC. Her artwork is also found today in the collections of
    the Princeton University Art Museum, the Detroit Historical Museum, and the
    Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York.

    Million Dollar Idea  is a significant artwork by Sam Middleton, a  
    tour-de-force  of his improvisitional technique, combining Abstract
    Expressionist painting with densely collaged surfaces of various found
    papers from billboards, magazines and newspapers. It is a summation of a
    modernist approach that reflected not only in his artistic practice, but his
    expatriate life and great interest in jazz music. Middleton once described,
    "the artist is, like a human mirror, reflecting ideas, images, feelings and

    Titled   Putting Down  and dated 1971 on the label <br><br>With its dark,
    floating orbs and vivid colors,   Night Push  epitomizes the unique and
    striking abstract painting of Kenneth Victor Young. Painting wet into wet,
    Young achieved these compositions of floating orbs and haloes suggesting
    forms in a floating or fluid space. With his distinctive style, Young became
    associated in the early 1970s with the rise of the Washington Color School;
    in 1968, he had his solo exhibition at the Franz Bader Gallery in
    Washington, DC, which represented him until 1977.<br><br>Born in Kentucky,
    Young's career began in the sciences - he studied and taught physics at
    Indiana University and chemical engineering at the University of Louisville.
    In the early 1960s, Young switched his studies to pursue visual art, joining
    a circle of artists at the University of Louisville including G. Caliman
    Coxe, Sam Gilliam and Bob Thompson. After moving to Washington, DC in 1964,
    he worked at the Smithsonian Institution for over 35 years as an exhibition
    installation designer. He was also an art instructor at the Corcoran Gallery
    of Art and the Duke Ellington School of the Arts in Washington, DC. Young
    also had solo exhibitions at the Carl Van Vechten Gallery at Fisk University
    in 1973, and at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, DC in 1974. His

    Georgia, Pinkney moved to Southern California after serving in the U.S. Air
    Force. After his term of service and time in Alaska and California, he

    Inspired by reading comic books as a child, his creativity led him to
    produce graphically inclined prints and murals. As a muralist, printmaker,
    and poet, he became a fixture in the community of Compton. In the early
    1970s, he was active in the Compton Communicative Arts Academy, where he met
    director and artist John Outterbridge. While known as a muralist, Pinkney’s
    printmaking has been shown widely in galleries and museums across the

    Museum of African American Art, and the San Bernardino County Museum.

    oil, lower right.<br><br>Provenance: private collection, New
    Jersey.<br><br>This poignant scene is from Rex Goreleigh's important  
    Migrant Series , a series of paintings depicting the rural life in New
    Jersey of migrant workers, incorporating a political and social awareness
    with a painterly approach.<br><br>Born in Penllyn, Pennsylvania, Goreleigh's
    family moved to Washington, DC, where he graduated from Dunbar High School.
    Throughout the 1930s, he was associated with many WPA programs and taught
    art across the United States. Goreleigh first worked with WPA muralist Ben
    Shahn in 1934. After a two-year hiatus studying art in Paris, he returned to
    New York and taught art at the Utopia House under the Federal Arts Project,
    and later at the Harlem branch of the YMCA. Goreleigh and Norman Lewis also
    taught under the Federal Art Project in Greensboro, NC, where he remained
    and married a local librarian. The couple moved to Chicago in 1940, and he
    worked as an art coordinator for the Schreiner-Bennet advertising agency.
    From 1944 to 1947, Goreleigh directed the Chicago South Side Community Art
    Center, succeeding its first director Margaret Burroughs.<br><br>In the late
    1940s, Goreleigh moved to Princeton, NJ and directed the Princeton Group
    Arts from 1947 to 1953, a community arts center that provided lessons and
    organized concerts, lectures, and exhibits. In 1955, he opened his
    "Studio-on-the-Canal" on Canal Road where he worked for 23 years - and where
    his friend the artist Hughie Lee-Smith also taught painting classes.
    Goreleigh's paintings and prints are included in the collections of the New
    Jersey State Museum, the Paul R. Jones Collection, University of Delaware,
    and the Harriet and Harmon Kelley Collection of African-American Art, San
    Antonio.

    Galleries, Ltd., New York, front cover.<br><br>Ed Clark's pigment on paper
    artworks lies between intention and accident.   Spatial Image III  is an
    excellent example of his works on paper, and a significant work in his
    development of the dry pigment technique, inspired by Pueblo sand paintings
    of the American Southwest. After working in Taos, New Mexico, Clark created
    a new group of large-scale painting in acrylic and works on paper composed
    of brown, blue, red, and orange pigment during a three month stay in Paris.
    He reinterpreted the oval forms that preoccupied him in the 1960s,
    reinterpreting the curved shapes as glowing clouds of atmospheric
    color.<br><br>In June Kelly's Randall Galleries catalogue essay, Clark
    describes this experimental approach: "With my hands forcing the colors, it
    is no longer the classic pastel technique. It is more akin to the sand
    painting of the Navajo and Pueblo Indians. The possiblity of changing the
    image is immediate and the opportunity for spontaneity is greatly enhanced.
    For me it has been a personal breakthrough in the abstract
    experience."<br><br>Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, he studied at the Art
    Institute of Chicago from 1946 to 1951, and in 1952 at the Academy de la
    Grande Chaumière in Paris, where he lived until 1958. George Sugarman then
    persuaded him to return to New York to help found the Brata Gallery with
    Ronald Bladen, Al Held and others. Clark exhibited there until 1966, when he
    returned to France for three more years. He has acknowledged the influence
    of the paintings of Nicolas de Stael and the music of Miles Davis and
    Charlie Parker, and later the gestural abstractions of Hans Hartung and
    Pierre Soulages. He exhibited internationally and his paintings are in
    numerous institutional collections including the Art Institute of Chicago,
    Brooklyn Museum, Detroit Institute of the Arts, Museum of Modern Art, Pérez
    Art Museum, Saint Louis Art Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

    Initialed, titled and dated in ink, verso. From the   Noah's Ark 
    series.<br><br>Provenance: acquired from G. R. N'Namdi Gallery, Detroit, MI;
    private collection, Michigan.<br><br>  Noah's Ark  is a series of painted
    collages that express nature, joy and optimism. The androgynous flat black
    figures and disembodied abstract shapes, suspended in a flat plane, vibrate
    with rhytmic energy. They form repetitious biomorphic patterns that fill
    many of the spaces, emphasizing the flatness while invigorating the
    composition. A hybrid of painting, collaged fabric, and still-life objects,
    these works express McGee’s belief in the, "interconnectedness of all
    things".<br><br>Beginning in 1947, Charles McGee was attending art classes
    part-time at the Society of Arts and Crafts in Detroit (now the College for
    Creative Studies). In 1951, he studied oil painting with the director Sarkis
    Sarkisian and was a classmate of Hughie Lee-Smith. He exhibited in the
    landmark exhibit   The Negro in American Art , UCLA Art Galleries, Los
    Angeles in 1966. He then curated Seven Black Artists at the Detroit Artists
    Market in 1969, which included himself, Lester Johnson, Henri Umbaji King,
    Robert Murray, James Lee, Allie McGhee, Harold Neal, and Robert J. Stull.
    This immediately led him to open the artists' collective Gallery 7 and the
    Charles McGee School of Art, which became a fixture in the Detroit art
    world. From this early academic beginning, McGee's work evolved into the
    large, vibrant and multi-media constructions that he is known for today. His
    works are now in many museum collections, including the Detroit Institute of
    Arts, Howard University and Clark Atlanta University. In 2009, Dr. Julia R.
    Myers curated the first major retrospective of his work with the exhibition
    and catalogue   Energy, Charles McGee at Eighty-Five  at Eastern Michigan
    University. Myers pp. 6-7.

    Depicted as an indomitable matriarch, Maryann Armstrong is the mother of
    trumpet virtuoso Louis Armstrong. She gave birth to him in 1901 in
    Battlefield, New Orleans. After the birth of her daughter, Beatrice, and the
    absence of her husband, she suffered poor health. Needing to work, she had
    Louis and his sister move in with their grandmother for the next five years.
    After fifth grade, Louis began picking up odd jobs to help support his
    mother and younger sister. Throughout his young life, Maryann was an ardent
    supporter of his musical talent.<br><br>Educator, sculptor and printmaker
    John T. Scott was born in Gentilly, Louisiana in 1940, and raised in New
    Orleans' Ninth Ward. His father worked as a restaurant cook and chauffeur
    while his mother stayed home. He learned embroidery from her that served as
    his first foray into the visual arts. Having a Catholic New Orleans
    upbringing, Scott attended the Xavier University in New Orleans receiving a
    BA degree. He received his MFA degree from Michigan State University in East
    Lansing in 1965, where he studied under painter Charles Pollock. Afterward,
    Scott returned to Xavier where he taught for 40 years. In 1983, Scott
    received a grant to study under sculptor George Rickey, and in 1992, he was
    awarded the MacArthur Grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
    Foundation. Scott received an honorary Doctor of Humanities from Michigan
    State University in 1995 and a Doctor of Humanities from Tulane University
    in New Orleans in 1997. His works are in the permanent collections of the

    Allan Ford, Washington, DC.<br><br>  Middle Passage  reflects the influence
    of African textile design in Akili Ron Anderson's practice. His artwork pays
    tribute to the African American community by using patterns, symbols, and
    culturally specific references. Inspired by the writings of Alain Locke and
    like the artists of the Harlem Renaissance, Anderson believes that the art
    of African Americans should document their heritage and contemporary life in
    uplifting ways. It is meant to be a celebration of African culture and a
    source of inspiration for African Americans. Also, Anderson is a member of
    AfriCOBRA which is reflected in his practice. He has continuously strived to
    make the dissemination of art accessible to this community by designing
    reliefs, stained glass, murals, and installations for religious, cultural,
    and public institutions.<br><br>Anderson studied at the Corcoran School of
    Art, 1964-65, and earned both a BFA and MFA from Howard University in 1969
    and 2008, respectively. Recent solo exhibitions include Hampton University
    Museum, July 9 - November 18, 2016. His work has been exhibited in   It
    Takes a Nation: Art for Social Justice American University Museum,
    Washington, DC with Emory Douglas, and the Black Panther Party, AFRICOBRA,
    and Contemporary Washington Artists , curated by Sandy Bellamy, September 6

    verso.<br><br>Provenance: acquired from Bill Hodges Gallery, NY, private

    produced a significant body of work in abstraction with paint and collage.
    Wimberley studied art with James A. Porter, Loïs Mailou Jones, and James
    Lesesne Wells at Howard University. While a student, he also played jazz and
    later developed friendships with musicians such as Miles Davis, Wayne
    Shorter, and Ron Carter in New York, who also informed his creative
    sensibility. The artist expressed that his use of found papers, objects and
    torn paper was influenced by the physical qualities of collage Pablo Picasso
    and Antoni Tàpies utilized in their works of the late 1960s and 70s. The
    artist has infused the formal qualities of abstraction with tension from the
    torn edges of the paper and cardboard.

    lower margin. Printed by the artist at the Lower East Side Print Shop, New
    York.<br><br>Jazz is an important motif for contemporary painter and
    printmaker Melvin Clark. This impressive woodcut is inspired by saxophone
    giant Sonny Rollins and bears the same name as his famous 1956   Prestige 
    album. In 1986, Clark received a fellowship to do his first woodcuts at
    Robert Blackburn's Printmaking Workshop in New York, and soon moved to New
    York from Detroit. Clark describes the impact of jazz in New York City upon
    his art: "I was able to see live, all the living legends of Jazz... I often
    use musical themes in my art. The energy of live musical performances is
    what I strive to capture in my compositions." Clark executed two large-scale
    public murals in the New York area, including the 1996 mosaic tile mural  
    Enchanted Dreams and Sunbird  at P.S. 152 in Brooklyn, and   New Spirit
    Ensemble,  a major mosaic mural at an entrance to Newark Penn Station,
    completed in 1998. His work is found today in the collections of the Museum
    of Modern Art, New York, the Modern African Arts Gallery, Amsterdam, the
    Printmaking Workshop, New York, the Lower East Side Printshop, New York, the
    Detroit Board of Education, and the Pehl Collection, Eldersburg, MD.

    Virginia.<br><br>Exhibited: Artist Pension Trust, 28 Liberty Street, New
    York, 2018.<br><br>  Bramble  is an excellent example of Mequitta Ahuja's
    innovative approach to self-portraiture, investigating ideas of feminism,
    historical forms of painting, myth and representation.   Bramble  was part
    of Ahuja's submission when she was awarded a 2009 Painters and Sculptors
    Grant from the Joan Mitchell Foundation. In 2009-10, she was also an
    artist-in-resident at the Studio Museum in Harlem.<br><br>Of South Asian and
    African American descent, Ahuja confronts the viewer and the artworld in her
    daring   Bramble . She portrays herself as a defiant, heroic figure,
    wielding a sword and rising above a bramble of abstraction. While boldly
    taking on the world of painting and the historical representation of women,
    Ahuja makes the narrative her own. The artist's statement solidifies this
    mission, "I show a woman-of-color articulating her own story and the story
    of painting. As a female artist of color, I have internalized the
    expectation that I should mine my personal experiences as case studies in
    the social conditions of race, class and gender. I both accept and step
    beyond that expectation. I aim to hold and embody in my worth the politics
    of identity as well as the function of self-portaiture exemplified by
    Poussin's 1650 self-portrait: displaying authoirty within the history and
    discipline of painting." Ahuja's cross cultural paintings combine diverse
    art historical sources such as Egyptian forms, Giotto frescoes, Hindu
    figurations and Mughal miniatures. Turning the narrative of portrait
    painting on its head, Ahuja's practice also challenges the traditions of
    Western art. She develops her self-portraits through a process of discovery,
    developing her character through performance, including costumes, props, and
    photography before painting.<br><br>The artist is the recipient of the 2018
    Guggenheim fellowship award. Her paintings have been exhibited
    internationally, most recently in   Riffs and Relations: African American
    Artists and the European Modern Tradition  at the Phillips Collection,
    Washington, DC. Her work is in many institutional collections including the
    Blanton Museum of Art, Austin, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the Museum
    of Fine Arts, Houston, Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Studio Museum in
    Harlem. She earned a BA degree from Hampshire College in 1998, and an MFA
    from the University of Illinois. She lives and works in Weston, CT, and

    taking up a good man's space, you should not be in this program. All you're
    going to do is get married, get pregnant, have a baby and a good man could
    have been in your seat.' I'll never forget that moment. I was so humiliated
    and embarrassed because this was a public event. And of course what
    happened? When I graduated, I got pregnant. [Laughs] I was embarrassed. I
    couldn't celebrate the fact that I was having a kid. Recently, my son found
    a contact sheet with photographs of my pregnant belly and he said, 'mom, you
    never printed these.' I remembered this story. What I realized in terms of
    flipping the script, was that I made space for a good man, by having my son,
    who is a photographer. Flipping that into positive energy and still creating
    work.” Martha St. Jean, “A Portrait of Deborah Willis,”   The Huffington

    All Falls Down , a series of paintings commissioned by the Museum of

    Japanese Ukiyo-e prints from the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin
    College, in addition to her experiences in a residency with Cleveland area
    high school students. She created a narrative that explored how young women
    get thrown "off course" by the cultural chaos of contemporary society. The
    narrative that she wove formed an elaborate story filled with fantastical
    lands, dynamic characters, and engaging plots.<br><br>iROZEALb (Iona Rozeal
    Brown) is best known for her clever merging of the imagery of Japanese
    Ukiyo-e prints, American hip-hop culture, and science fiction. She first
    became interested in Japanese visual culture after learning about ganguro, a
    phenomenon popular in Japan during the 1990s in which girls darkened their
    skin and dyed their hair blond as a challenge to ideals of beauty. Brown
    earned a BFA from the San Francisco Art Institute and an MFA from Yale
    University in 2002. Both a visual artist and DJ, who has lived in Tokyo and
    Yokohama, Brown currently lives and works in Washington, DC.

  TYPESET: '  Boy Holding Grapes .'
  FOOTNOTE: >-
    Digital C-print, 2012. 1003x749 mm; 40x30 inches. Edition of 10 plus two AP.
    Signed on verso.<br><br>  Boy Holding Grapes  is Awol Erizku's clever twist
    on Caravaggio’s   Young Sick Bacchus (Bacchino Malato) . Dated between 1593
    to 1594,   Young Sick Bacchus (Bacchino Malato)  indicates Caravaggio’s
    physical ailment involving malaria during his first years in Rome but
    depicts an alluring god of drink and vice. Erizku twists art history to draw
    attention to the lack of racial diversity represented in the canon and the
    depiction of the beauty of African Americans.<br><br>A photographer with a
    sharp eye and keen wit, Erizku observed that there weren’t many museum
    masterpieces featuring people of color and set to recreate the classics.
    “The models I choose to work with are not professional models but possess an
    undeniable, striking beauty,” declares Erizku. His practice bridges the gap
    between African and African American visual culture, referencing art
    history, hip hop, and universal human culture.<br><br>Erizku received a BFA
    from The Cooper Union in 2010 and a MFA from the Yale School of Art in 2014.
    He exhibited at institutions across the country including the Museum of
    Modern Art, New York, and the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York. Recent solo
    exhibitions include   New Visions for Iris , Public Art Fund, New York, NY
    and Chicago, IL, 2021;   Mystic Parallax,  The FLAG Art Foundation, New
    York, NY, 2020;   Desire: A Revision from the 20th Century to the Digital
    Age,  Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, 2019. Erizku lives and works in
    Los Angeles.

    Oil on linen canvas, 1997. 1270x1168 mm; 50x46 inches. Signed in oil, lower
    right.<br><br>Provenance: the estate of the artist; thence by descent to the
    current owner, private collection.<br><br>Exhibited: Stella Jones Gallery,
    New Orleans, LA.<br><br>According to the estate, the artist's original title
    for the painting was   Quandary ; it was changed posthumously to   View From
    The Window  as indicated on the label.<br><br>This colorful canvas explores
    representation, and epitomizes the Surrealism found in Hughie Lee-Smith's
    late-career painting. The compressed space, architectural elements and
    faceless mannequin inhabit a metaphysical, dream-like space and reflect the
    influence of Giorgio De Chirico. In the Hughie Lee-Smith papers, Archives of
    American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Lee-Smith wrote in a 1988 letter to
    Lowery Stokes Sims, "those who exterted an extraordinary influence of the
    direction of my painting were: Steumpfig, Evergood, the Berman Brothers,
    Peter Blume, Hopper, Balthus, and particularly Giorgio De Chirico." The
    sun-drenched light and floating balloon reinforce the frozen moment, whilst
    the arrows illustrate the choices an artist has to make in defining a
    subject. Full of intrigue and beauty,   Quandary  is an excellent example of
    the final period of Lee-Smith's oeuvre.

    artist's   Plaques  series <br><br>Provenance: private collection, New
    York.<br><br>This intriguing drawing is from Sprout's later career
    exploration of the forms of plaques, doorways, books and masks. Sprout
    considered them as both spiritual and physical vehicles as well as gateways
    between African and Western culture. Sprout is best known for his 1970s  
    Muslim Tile Pattern  series of paintings and prints, and his painting   Azo 
    had pride of place at the Johnson Publishing Company - hanging in the

    studio art and art education in the School of Art at the University of
    Arizona in the 1960s. He enrolled in the MFA program of the University of
    California, San Diego, in fall 1970, where he progressed from figuration
    into abstraction, and learned of Islamic ornamentation and imagery in his
    art history studies of North African culture. Sprout had a long career as a
    painter, printmaker and art educator. He taught visual art through the 1980s
    in Denver; first at the University of Denver before becoming a tenured
    professor at Metropolitan State College. He took a sabattical, returning to
    Los Angeles in 1984, and earned an MA in African Studies with a
    concentration on African art history from UCLA in 1990. Sprout moved to
    Purchase, New York with his wife, museum director and curator Lucinda

    Science and Industry, Chicago, and the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, CT.
    Hicks's quilts were the subject of a PhD dissertation by Yolanda Woods,  
    New World African Conjurers Who Edify and Heal the Community , and the
    artist is included in   The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American

    , the children’s book   Martha Ann’s Quilt for Queen Victoria  and the quilt
    history   This I Accomplish: Harriet Powers’ Bible Quilt and Other Pieces .

    Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. stitched on its surface. Stitched on
    the quilt are also the names of people that marched and died during the
    Civil Rights movement,  including Medgar Evers, Denise McNair and Addie Mae
    Collins. The surface is embellished with text, a blazer, plastic letters,
    and a metal sign. <br><br> Cummings is widely regarded as one of the
    nation's leading African American quilters. A Los Angeles native, he moved
    to New York City in 1970 and became friends with Romare Bearden. He
    experimented with collage in various media, and by 1975, moved strictly to
    fabric. Today, he lives and works in Harlem. Other quilts by Cummings are in
    the permanent collections of the American Craft Museum, New York, the Studio
    Museum in Harlem, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the
    California African American Museum, Atlanta Life Insurance, Renwick Gallery,
    the Smithsonian Institution, and the Museum of Art and Design, New York.
    Cummings was previously commissioned by the Art in Embassies, Absolut Vodka,
    the City of Knoxville, the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, the
    PerCent for Art, NYC Department of Cultural Affairs, and HBO.

    Gelatin silver emulsion on tobacco leaf on handmade Japan paper, 2004.
    647x622 mm; 25½x24½ inches, (sheet). From the series   The Tobacco Project 
    2003 - 2007.<br><br>  Morgan  is from Accra Shepp's study that explores
    photoreactive materials and a socio-economic investigation of the history of
    tobacco farming. The leaves he uses in replacement of photopaper are dried
    then flatened. Next, they are chemically treated. Ultimately, a
    light-sensitive coating is applied to record and fix the image. From 2003 -
    2007, Shepp traveled to three farms in Georgia, Kentucky, and North Carolina
    to explore the relationship of tobacco farmers with their crop and the land
    on which it grows. He uses photoreactive materials to transform dried leaves
    into canvases that explore tobacco's fraught history and cultivation through
    the use of 18th and 19th-century enslavement to 21st-century migrant
    labor.<br><br>Born 1962 in New York City, Shepp is a writer and
    photographer. He graduated from Princeton University in 1984, where he
    studied with Emmet Gowin, then attained an MFA from NYU where he studied at
    the Institute of Fine Arts and the Conservation Center. His work is in the
    permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of
    Chicago, and The Victoria and Albert Museum.

    the urban partitions they both created. Before earning an MFA degree in
    painting from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1993, Sparrow was the
    recipient of honors with a Skowhegan residency, a fellowship for a National
    Gallery of Art internship and a grant from the National Endowment for the
