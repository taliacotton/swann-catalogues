    English medical book with a suite of full-paged engravings, and only the
    second book printed in England to contain engravings of any kind, set it
    apart on several levels. One may surmise that the missing plates seemed too
    explicit for some set of tastes between 1545 and 2021. As a summary of
    Vesalius, an abridged version with full illustrations, it brought valuable

    He consulted a manuscript of Cleomedes' work from the Cardinal François de
    Joyeuse's (1562-1615) library. Cleomedes was an ancient Greek astronomer and
    author of <i>On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies</i>, a blend of
    philosophy and science from a Stoic perspective. Through his extensive
    verbatim references to Posidonius of Rhodes (135-51 BCE), he has effectively
    preserved the work, which has not come down to us through any extant
    manuscripts. Cleomedes' work is valuable for its accurate obersvations on
    lunar eclipses, and the earliest clear explantion of the Sun and Moon
    Illusion, i.e., why the rising and setting bodies look larger at the horizon
    than they do when fully risen, even though their sizes do not change. Even
    this he attributes to Posidonius.

    dialogue between Aristotle, Ptolemy, and Copernicus; large engraved vignette

    blind-embossed on engraved title (20th century); bookplate of Otto Orren
    Fisher inside front board, 9 x 6 1/2 in.<br><br>It was the publication of
    the present work that landed Galileo in hot water with the Holy See and into
    permanent house arrest until his death in 1642. The astronomer explores the
    relative merits of the heliocentric model in the form of a dialogue, as
    indicated by the title. Three characters present different viewpoints.
    Salviati is a heliocentric Copernican, Sagredo is neutral, and Simplicio is
    an adherent of the Aristotelian/Ptolemaeic system that places the earth at
    the center of the universe. The arguments are mathematical, complicated, and
    at times speculative. Galileo sketches out his important theory of inertial
    frame of reference, a concept that has held up over the centuries, and much
    of the work is prescient and accurate. As an early work, it also contains
    unresolved loose ends, keeping subsequent scientists and observers on the
    job.<br><br>Carli-Favaro 38, 180; Cinti 215, 109; Riccardi I 513.

    proportional or reduction compass is a device that facilitates the

    has two legs, like a normal compass, but the pivot point can be adjusted by
    moving it along a channel cut in each leg. Once set, the change in size of a
    set figure can be made by consulting the needle points on the other end of
    the compass. A practical instrument for sculptors, craftsmen, and
    astronomers alike, its invention has been credited to Galileo, Hulsius, Jost
    Bürgi, and Fabrizio Mordente, although it was certainly used in antiquity,

    gastric complaints. "Le bicorne rude avait été évacué en grande abondance
    par une jeune fille [...] à la suite d'un purgatif." (Bottentuit) Under the
    microscope, the doctor observed these strange horned structures, the
    "bicorne rude" of the title, and concluded that he had discovered a new
    species of parasitic intestinal worm. Although Sultzer's work was accepted
    by some contemporary colleagues, subsequent research revealed the mysterious
    horned parasite to be nothing more than seed of the black mulberry (Morus
    nigra), presumably eaten (in abundance) by his patient.  German-Austrian
    hygienist and parasitologist Johann Gottfried Bremser (1767-1827) reviewed
    Sulter's work and suggested that these worms looked very much like seeds,
    although he wasn't sure of the variety. And thus the bicorne rude passed
    from parasite to pseudo-parasite.<br><br>Cahiers de Formation Parasitologie,
