    folding sheet; stitch holes along inner margin, tightly trimmed with slight
    loss along fore-edge of #2 and #21, a few contemporary inked notations,
    moderate wear and toning.
  FOOTNOTE: ' The Alaskan was one of the first newspapers published in Alaska, preceded only by the short-lived Sitka Times (1868-1871) and Sitka Post (1876-1877). The Alaskan survived much longer than its predecessors, through at least 1908. <BR><BR>The first issue dated 7 November 1885 includes some colorful details on the obstacles faced by the new publication. The man contracted to serve as printer never arrived, but the Deputy Collector of Customs proved to have the needed skills. In other news, a tomcat stole a haunch of venison off the territorial governor''s plate during dinner, so the governor grabbed a gun and shot the cat as it fled. Although the Yukon Gold Rush was still many years away, the mining industry is discussed frequently in all three issues. Issue Number 2, dated 14 November 1885, reports that "the native boys, most of them barefooted, are engaged in a game of base-ball on the parade ground." Number 21, dated 27 March 1886, featured a long report on the black-tailed deer.  '

The next year he and a small group of his people accompanied Oglethorpe on a trip to England, where they had an audience with George II, and were present for the signing of the treaty establishing the settlement. During this visit, Tomochichi, his nephew Toonahowi, and a captive bald eagle sat for a formal portrait. <BR><BR>This engraving was originally published as an illustration to a scarce Georgia emigration tract by Samuel Urlsperger, "Der ausführlichen Nachrichten von der Königlich-Gross-Britannischen Colonie Saltzburgischer Emigranten in America."

  FOOTNOTE: ' Efforts to displace the Chippewa and Ottawa inhabitants of Michigan began with the Indian Removal Act of 1830, but were widely resisted. Prospective destinations on the Great Plains would have been too great a shift from the northern woodlands, while more familiar terrain in Wisconsin or Minnesota would have put them in conflict with the Sioux. See Elizabeth Neumeyer, "Michigan Indians Battle Against Removal," in Michigan History 55 (1971), pages 275-288. Rather than submit to removal, some exchanged land rights for American citizenship, as seen in this document from southwestern Michigan:<BR><BR>"We the undersigned descendants of the Chippewa and Ottawa tribes of Indians, having been born in the State of Michigan, and always resided therein--being attached to the soil, where the bones of our Fathers are laid" promised to adopt "the laws, habits of life, and Government of the white people of the United States . . . that we may enjoy the benefits of civilization and Christianity, and the privileges and civil rights of citizens and voters." <BR><BR>No other examples of this handbill have been traced in OCLC or at auction.

It draws heavily on his personal experiences, and also devotes several pages to the recent Battle of the Little Bighorn. He emphasizes the savage cruelty of the American Indian and predicts that "in a few years the only reminiscence of the Red Men will be the preservation of the names of some of the extinct tribes and dead chiefs in the nomenclature of the leading cities, counties, and States of the Great West."<BR><BR>Ironically, Blackmore became heavily indebted and killed himself in a fit of drunken despair the following year, while the American Indians are still here.

    Receipt for drinks and damages incurred by the New York Triumvirate at a
    famed Sons of Liberty tavern.
  at-a-glance: '[New York], 7 February 1769'
  TYPESET: >-
    Manuscript document, 5¾ x 4 inches, almost blank on verso; folds, minor
    wear.
  FOOTNOTE: ' In the years before the American Revolution, a group of three New York lawyers became known as "The Triumvirate": William Smith (1728-1793), William Livingston (1723-1790), and John Morin Scott (1730-1814). In 1752, they founded a short-lived but influential weekly political journal called the Independent Reflector, the only of its kind in the colonies. As the colonies veered toward rebellion, the three friends took different paths: Scott became an outspoken member of the Sons of Liberty, Livingston was a moderate patriot who opposed independence, while Smith became a prominent Loyalist. <BR><BR>This document places the Triumvirate together in a very interesting time and place: Bolton & Sigell''s tavern, where the New York Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1768, and where in March 1769, New York merchants active in the Sons of Liberty met there to enforce their non-importation boycott. It was leased from Samuel Fraunces, and still stands today as the legendary Fraunces Tavern. In this hotbed of liberty, the three friends were joined by William Bayard (1729-1804), a delegate to the Stamp Act Congress of 1765 and member of the Sons of Liberty, although he later cast his lot with the Loyalists. <BR><BR>Knowing the background of these men makes this humble tavern receipt more interesting. The bill is for supper, spruce beer, punch, porter, a large quantity of madeira wine costing twice as much as supper, and 15 shillings for "china plates broke." The total cost is billed to "Mr. Wm. Bayard, Mr. Smith, Mr. Wm. Livingston, Mr. Scott," and is signed "Received the contents, Bolton & Sigell." <BR><BR>At a time when New Yorkers were anxiously picking sides between loyalty and rebellion, these four strong-willed leaders with very different paths met in the hotbed of rebellion and shared more than a few drinks. Plates were broken--innocently dropped, or hurled across the room in anger, in a fight about a drunken insult, or over the fate of America--we will probably never know. <BR><BR>Provenance: recently acquired from a dealer who also offered other William Bayard documents.

  TYPESET: >-
    12 manuscript pages, 12 x 7½ inches, on 4 unbound folding sheets; folds,
    minor wear and dampstaining.
  FOOTNOTE: ' These notes were apparently taken during an investigation of the finances of a Masonic lodge in Boston at some point not long after 1807, ensuring that it had clear title to its lodge building. However, this was not just any lodge, and not just any building. The notes were taken from the original records of St. Andrews Lodge, which had been established in 1756 and quickly became a locus of revolutionary activity. The lodge acquired its building in 1766 and used the first floor for meetings, while the basement was operated as the Green Dragon Tavern, otherwise known as the "Headquarters of the Revolution," where the Sons of Liberty held surreptitious meetings. <BR>Whoever went through the records to untangle the lodge''s finances clearly also had an interest in the lodge''s place in history. Special note is made of Joseph Warren''s admission as a member on 14 May 1765. Paul Revere is mentioned thrice as a member of the lodge''s standing committee during the 1768 purchase discussions and in 1777. James Otis, the Patriot lawyer who wrote "Taxation without Representation is tyranny," is here consulted in 1767: "A com''e was appointed to get advice from Mr. James Otis respecting the house." The last document discussed in the notes is an 1807 report on the lodge''s finances, which found that the lodge had paid $1555.56 for the "Green Dragon Tavern," followed by $39.24 in repairs from 1760 to 1774.

    Lithograph, 15 x 17½ inches; 3-inch closed tear on left edge, edges and

  FOOTNOTE: ' Moses Swett (1804-1838) here adapts the well-known 1775 view of the battle by Amos Doolittle, with his drawing then put on stone by Boston''s first lithographers, Pendleton''s Lithography. Swett made some adjustments to Doolittle''s contemporary rendering, cleaning up some of the primitive perspective and scale from the original, and altering the buildings in the background for composition purposes. The biggest change, though, is with the patriot troops in the foreground. Doolittle had depicted the event as a massacre of unorganized civilians by a formidable British military, with the dead or scattering Americans portrayed as victims. This made sense in the context of 1775, when the British were viewed as aggressors. By the 1830s, with the United States well established and annual Independence Day celebrations in honor of its origin stories, Swett reshaped the scene to show the patriots standing firm and firing back at the British regulars. See "Imagining the Battle of Lexington" at the American Revolution Institute website for more on this interesting comparison.

  FOOTNOTE: ' In 1775, Falmouth was a sprawling township in the northern section of Massachusetts which would soon become known as the District of Maine. The most populous section of Falmouth was "the Neck," which would be broken off as the city of Portland ten years later. Falmouth Neck was the site of considerable revolutionary action, including "Thompson''s War," a standoff between the Royal Navy and a patriot militia in early May 1775. The present document was written in Falmouth shortly afterward to ensure loyalty among the "several hundreds on ye Neck." <BR><BR>"Agreeable to a resolve of our provincial Congress on the 8th of May ult''o, the Committee of Correspondence in this town, in order to know who are enemical to the rights of mankind and the interest of America, having proposed the following declaration of agreement to be sign''d by the inhabitants thereof, we the said inhabitants do heartily & cheerfully subscribe the same, viz: <BR><BR>We solemnly and sincerely declare that it is our opinion that the ministry of Great Britain and the Parliament have of late invaded the constitutional rights and liberties of this country by prosecuting their avowed design of raising a revenue here without our consent, as well as arbitrarily infringing our charter, and altering the civil government of this province, and therefore, to prevent a state of slavery, do sincerely and heartily agree and engage to do our utmost to carry into execution whatever measures have been or may be consistently recommended by the Continental and our provincial congresses for the purpose of opposing and frustrating those evil designs and for the preservation of our happy constitution, until a reconciliation between Great Britain and America upon constitutional principles can be obtained, which God grant may be speedily brought about, and that we will readily and heartily join our countrymen on all occasions in defence of our said rights and liberties as we trust our cause is righteous, and that we may succeed. We shall endeavor to oblige all persons to pay due obedience to the general resolves of Congress in particular, one for the regulation of the militia, to obey the orders of the several military officers who have been or shall be elected by the several companies and regiments, agreeable to the resolves of Congress, and to preserve peace and good order among ourselves and safety to the lives and properties of every individual among us." <BR><BR>This is not the original petition with signatures. Added in a different hand is a note: "This was signed by several hundreds on ye Neck, indeed all but the Custom House officers, Mr. Pagan, who gave ye committee a very handsome letter in excuse, and Mr. Courning[?], and I don''t recollect any body except those who have left us. This method was agreed upon by ye committee to find out who were enemies, as the presumption was that those who were Tories &c would not sign it."<BR><BR>Similar resolutions were passed in other New England towns during these early months of the Revolution, but this Falmouth resolution does not seem to be published.

    inches, with address panel (no postal markings) and docketing on verso, plus
    integral blank; 2½-inch fore-edge chip with loss of several words including
    most of signature, other moderate wear.
  FOOTNOTE: ' "I am informed, sir, that you offered the major''s place in the army to two of your captains before Major Mitchell was appointed. . . . How they could be cal''d major and bare the same rank they now do is a thing I cannot solve by rule or grammar. . . . I realy conceive of your conduct to be degraiding of that set of officers, and as one of them I very modestly and calmly resent your conduct." Quite a cheeky letter to write to your commanding officer. <BR><BR>The damaged signature reads only "Jo---," but the docketing reads "Maj''r Hathaway''s reflecting letter to G. Godfrey." Godfrey served as Brigadier General from January 1776 to July 1781. He appointed Abiel Mitchell as Major in February 1776, about the same time as John Hathaway was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.  '

  FOOTNOTE: ' While the land battles of the American Revolution came almost completely to an end at Yorktown in 1781, the two powers still clashed at sea. This letter passes on the fresh news of the Battle of Delaware Bay (or Battle of Cape May). Three American privateers were accompanying a merchant convoy into Philadelphia when they were attacked by three ships of the Royal Navy. The privateer Hyder Ally was commanded by Continental Navy captain Joshua Barney, who delivered the British a thrashing. <BR><BR>Here, a Philadelphia merchant writes to wealthy Rhode Island merchant John Brown (1736-1803), then visiting with his friend Governor John Hancock in Boston. After addressing a minor insurance matter, he passes on dramatic news. "Nothing new since my last, except Capt. Barney in the ship Hyder Aly taking the King ship Monk of 10 nine pounders, in an action of 30 minutes. The Hyder Aly mounted 6 nines & 10 sixes. There never was more execution done by the same force in the same time. The Monk had every officer except two, killed or wounded. Amongst the latter was the Capt. She had in all 21 kill''d & 32 wounded. The Hyder Aly had 4 kill''d & 11 wounded. From such slaughter no doubt you''d conclude one of them boarded, but it was not the case. A fair action within pistol shot."<BR><BR>Crawford also adds a postscript about a notable American privateer: "Rec''d a New York paper of the 11th giving an acc''t of Capt. Nicholson in the Dean being cary''d into Jam[aic]a by a 40-gun ship."  '

    including a couple of partly torn photographs and a few others coming
    detached.
  FOOTNOTE: ' Robert Peary''s third Arctic expedition from 1898 to 1902 resulted in the discovery of the northernmost point on mainland Greenland at Cape Morris Jesup. The first relief expedition was planned for the summer of 1899, to bring supplies aboard the steamer Diana. This album was compiled by a participant in the relief expedition. <BR><BR>The Diana made stops at Sydney, Nova Scotia, and the larger settlements at Disko Bay and Upernavik, Greenland, before reaching Peary''s base at Etah in northern Greenland. The photographs show everything one might expect, and more: Arctic scenery including glaciers, fjords, and icebergs; sled dogs; numerous groups of Inuit at work or with their children; shots of the Diana and its crew; and several walrus carcasses. Only a few of the photographs are captioned. One of them shows Matthew Henson, Peary''s longtime colleague and the most notable Black Arctic explorer, who was with Peary in their still-controversial 1909 dash to the North Pole. Henson is seen wearing his furs on the ice as he prepares to enter an open rowboat. Robert Peary is named in one caption, standing outside his Etah headquarters with the expedition''s physician T.F. Diedrich. Another uncaptioned shot of the pair is clearly from the same sitting. Another shows Peary, Henson, and Diedrich posed with more than 30 Inuit. Two photographs near the end show the Diana and its expedition members in Sydney, Nova Scotia on 20 July 1899, with long appended captions and photographer credits. The photographer is not credited for the other photographs, but they were likely taken by the relief expedition member who compiled the album. We have traced no other examples of these images. <BR><BR>3 photographs at the end are captioned from a different expedition, to Alaska. One is dated 18 August [1898?]. One shows four named men in a canoe, another shows the harbor at Skagway, and the last shows a party of Alaskan Natives in a canoe on the Yentna River near the southern Alaska coast. Another group of 10 uncaptioned photos near the end, printed on a different stock from the other Peary Relief photos, may also date from this Alaska expedition. <BR><BR>This album was apparently compiled by Frank Caspar Hinckley (1874-1935) of Bangor, ME, an 1896 graduate of Harvard who was part of an 1898 United States Geological Expedition to the southern coast of Alaska, and then spent the summer of 1899 as part of the Peary Relief Expedition in Greenland. Newspaper reports name him as part of the relief expedition''s "Sportsmen''s Party." He is named in the captions of photos from both expeditions in the rear of this volume. He spent the remainder of his life as a woodsman, mapping and exploring timberlands from Maine to Labrador; and then establishing parks and campgrounds in northern Maine. <BR><BR>Provenance: found at a tag sale by Connecticut antique shop owner Susan Snow.

As seen here, the plane dipped the moment it left the ramp; its landing gear splashed through the water before he was able to regain some altitude and land safely on a nearby beach. This was the first airplane to take off from a ship, ushering in the age of aircraft carriers. <BR><BR>Ely was a civilian stunt pilot; two months later he succeeded in landing the Pusher on the USS Pennsylvania in the first successful shipboard landing. A crash in an October 1911 air show ended his life; he was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his pioneering aircraft carrier flights.  '

  FOOTNOTE: ' The Bull Creek Oil Company was founded in 1864, not long after an 1859 success in Pennsylvania launched the first American oil boom. The company''s offices were in Philadelphia, and their wells were in Pleasants County, WV, near the Ohio border. The founder was prominent early oilman Thomas Wharton Phillips (1835-1912), who later went on to serve in Congress for Pennsylvania. <BR><BR>The main volume in this lot is titled "Account Sales &c" on the front board, and its pages are headed "Superintendent''s Report," running from 1864 to 1876. It summarizes expenses and production at the company''s wells, starting with three wells on the Hendershot Farm, which produced 636 barrels by 1 August 1864 after an initial outlay of $3238 for machinery, salaries and labor in June and July. A detailed 3-page listing of the initial expenses through 30 September is tipped in. For the early months, the names of some laborers are given, as well as other expenses such as a tin dipper, funnel, copper boiler, and more. Production slowed after that first year. The last barrels sold were reported in 1873, and the final page covers mostly taxes and legal fees through 1876. Near the rear of the volume are 4 pages of expenses for a new well boring project in 1866. The volume includes 33 manuscript pages total, plus 4 receipts and memoranda laid in. <BR><BR>Also included are 2 volumes of the company''s stock certificate transfers, one thick volume nearly filled at 503 leaves from July 1864 to April 1866, and a smaller volume with only 13 completed pages from April 1866 to October 1873. Thomas W. Phillips'' initial 50,000 shares are recorded on page 2. Each transfer is signed by the seller or his attorney. The company''s petty stock ledger is arranged alphabetically by stockholder and extends to 278 pages, perhaps half of them blank. Last is the capital stock register of the semi-related Niagara Oil Company from 1864 to 1873. Isaac Newton Phillips (1820-1883) appears as the principal stockholder; he was the brother of Thomas. T.W. Phillips and "Phillips Brothers" appear in the volume.  '

  FOOTNOTE: ' John Bigler (1805-1871) was a Pennsylvania lawyer who went west with the Gold Rush. He found work in such undignified professions as wood chopper, stevedore and auctioneer, before gaining a foothold in state politics. In 1852 he became California''s third governor, and the first elected after statehood. He was popular enough to gain re-election, and the state''s largest lake was named Lake Bigler in his honor; it was later renamed Lake Tahoe. <BR><BR>In this inaugural address, Bigler looks back at California''s history from his own personal experience: "But a short time since and we were a roving and unsettled people; mere dwellers in tents." He embraces the rapid advance of agriculture and education, and opposes efforts to establish mining monopolies: "The mines should be left as free as the air we breathe" (page 9). Hoping to stamp out corruption, he warned that it would be "our own fault then, if California does not grow to be one of the most prosperous and flourishing States of the Union." This address was also published in the California Senate journal, but we can trace no other examples of this separate printing in OCLC or at auction. Not in Greenwood''s California Imprints.  '

    Fan letter to the early western satirist George Horatio Derby from an

  TYPESET: >-
    Autograph Letter Signed from Lewis Gaylord Clark, signed "L. Gaylord Clark"
    and "L.G.C.," to "dear Phoenix" [George Horatio Derby]. 4 pages, 8 x 5
    inches, on one folding sheet; minor foxing.
  FOOTNOTE: ' George Horatio Derby (1823-1861) was an officer in the Army''s Corps of Topographical Engineers who was assigned to San Diego in 1853. There he launched a side career as a humorist under the pen names "Squibob" and "John Phoenix," contributing pieces to several California newspapers. An extended illness led to his resignation from the Army in 1859; he removed with his wife and son to New York, and died in 1861 well before his 40th birthday. His satirical writings have remained popular over the years. <BR><BR>This letter was written by Lewis Gaylord Clark (1808-1873), who as editor of the Knickerbocker Magazine was one of the literary tastemakers of his era. They had apparently corresponded several times before. Clark flattered Derby''s wit and tried to solicit his submission for the Knickerbocker: "I vow, I never laughed so loud and long as I did when I got that letter. . . . My wife heard me, and our friends, full half a mile off. . . . That letter was over six mos. in coming. . . . Look here, Brother Phoenix, write for the Knickerbocker. Your humor hits my poor fancy, such as it is, exactly. That satire which tells without stinging, that equivoque which does not go too near the edge, that burlesque which, while it exposes folly and humbug, does nothing else (a rare merit, Mr. Derby)--these are yours. Is a fact, and no flattery, as true as you live. Give us su''thin. Don''t be a-feared. . . . You will hear something about yourself in our Sept. no. Keep your good things for me. . . . The K is such a medium, that there is not another like it in the country. We go before 150,000 readers a month, and the right kind." <BR><BR>Clark also alluded to Derby''s other sideline, as an artist, as Derby had mailed him a portrait: "Washington Irving sent me over a note yesterday--his cottage is exactly opposite me, across the Tappan Zee--in which he acknowledges your picture of Washington. . . . He says ''Let me thank you for the composite picture of General Washington. It is inimitable. I have placed it to the disposition of Mr. Putnam, for his series of American illustrations.''" <BR><BR>WITH--approximately 210 letters dated circa 1885-1905 from Derby''s widow Mary Angeline Coons Derby (1827-1906) mostly from Brooklyn, NY to their son George McClellan Derby (1856-1948), most still in their original envelopes; approximately 50 letters circa 1895-1907 from Mary''s sister Virginia Coons Shaler, aka "Aunt Jenny" (1836-1908) to George McClellan Derby (some while she was with her husband in Panama where he was a railroad superintendent); and approximately 24 other miscellaneous letters to George McClellan Derby dated 1874-1903. The son was a West Point graduate and Corps of Engineers career officer best known for his important role in Cuba in the Spanish-American War, where he conducted reconnaissance missions, mapped troop landing areas, and surveyed the field by balloon ascension during the advance; he was later stationed for several years in New Orleans.

In addition to his vast holdings and expertise in early Americana and American Judaica, he also became the leader in a more humble field: early 19th-century children''s chapbooks, based on a stock of remainders from his uncle Moses Pollok.

Tom Plump is the star of the show: the story of a boy who goes to California to make his fortune, returns home a failure, grows fat, gets married, and drowns. It is told in 35 small engravings, much like a comic book or graphic novel. <BR><BR>The Juvenile Gem title page is apparently a remainder from the Huestis & Cozans partnership, which dissolved in 1853. It was used to bind together these chapbooks in various combinations, as seen in other examples. These 6 chapbooks were all printed by Cozans at his 107 Nassau Street address, where he moved in May 1855.  '

    4 Autograph Letters Signed simply as "Geo." to his mother, niece, and
    nephew.  6, 4, 4, and 3 pages, various sizes; mailing folds, the first two
    letters with moderate water damage.
  FOOTNOTE: ' A significant group of letters, some written as a division commander on the Peninsula Campaign. George Webb Morell (1815-1883) of Cooperstown, NY graduated first in his West Point class in 1835, and rejoined the army as a brigadier general early in the war in August 1861. His most notable service was as a division commander on the Peninsula Campaign in the spring of 1862, but his loyalty to his commander Fitz John Porter effectively ended his military career when Porter was court-martialed. <BR><BR>These letters are not signed with his surname, but can easily be attributed to Morell by his frequent discussion of the units under his command, by the names of his relatives, and his handwriting. The first two letters are to his mother Maria Webb Morell (1793-1868) from Minor''s Hill, a large Union encampment near Arlington, VA. On 2 December 1861, he reports on his brigade''s Thanksgiving: "The officers of the N.Y. 14th gave a dinner to which they invited Gen. Porter & staff, myself & staff & the colonels of my three other regiments . . . & went off as well as if the dinner had been served by Delmonico." He also notes: "I enclose a copy of Gen. McClellan''s order complementing our division. We can hold our own." The printed order (General Orders No. 44 of the Army of the Potomac) remains with the letter. His 26 February 1862 letter also mentions his controversial commander: "The absence of Gen''l Porter has prevented my visiting the city." He also reports on a hurricane "demolishing an observatory nearly 60 feet high which was erected in the autumn beside my quarters to command a view of the surrounding country."<BR><BR>On 12 June 1862, he wrote to his sister''s daughter Julia Mitchell Chester (1840-1891) from "Camp near New Bridge, Va.," after a promotion. He explains that "Gen. Porter now commands a corps, & I have his division." He discusses the recent battles of Hanover Court House and Fair Oaks. At Hanover Court House, he describes what has since become known as the fog of war: "Had we known half as much of the country & localities there as we did a few hours later, we could have captured the whole force opposed to us." At Fair Oaks, his division was stranded on the wrong side of a swollen river, so he missed the fighting, but did have one adventure: "I was up in the balloon (& so was Andy at another point, for there are two of them) & saw a very large force over the river with Richmond in the background." This was the first Civil War battle in which the famed balloons of Thaddeus Lowe were deployed. Perhaps Brigadier General Andrew Humphries was the "Andy" who also enjoyed an ascension. <BR><BR>Morell''s final letter in this lot was to his sister''s son Captain George Morell Chester (1838-1891), who had apparently spent time on Morell''s staff. It was written from "Camp at Harrison''s Bar, James River, Va.," on 5 July 1862, days after McClellan''s withdrawal ended the Peninsula Campaign. The campaign''s final battles are described: "My division bore the brunt of the fight at Gaines'' Mill & Malverne & has suffered terribly--my old brigade more than the others. It (my brigade) was engaged at Mechanicsville also. . . . Col. Black & Woodbury & Lieut. Col. Skillen are killed, Col. Cass wounded, probably mortally; Lieut. Col. Sweitzer wounded & a prisoner. You will remember all of them." '

  FOOTNOTE: ' John Randolph Jackson (circa 1840-1891) was a private in the 1st Maryland Infantry Regiment, part of the Potomac Home Brigade in the Union army. At some point in 1862, he got hold of this banal volume of United States governmental documents (Franklin Pierce''s State of the Union address and diplomatic reports) and filled its blank pages with patriotic notes and doodles. The front pastedown has a flag reading "Plaid out"; the rear flyleaves include his name and the proclamation "Jeff Davis is a son of a bitch and all others Rebbles." The rear endpapers are decorated with a large Union flag reading "The Union For Ever", adding "Old Baltimore ever true to the Union." <BR><BR>If we had to guess when this work was done, Jackson''s regiment was captured in the fall of Harper''s Ferry in September 1862 and then sent to a Union-run parole camp in Maryland to await exchange. Perhaps he had access to unloved and untended books in the parole camp; you certainly can''t imagine him lugging around this tome while fighting at Gettysburg, as the regiment did the following July. <BR><BR>Jackson worked as a painter and raised a family in Baltimore after the war.

  FOOTNOTE: ' This law book began its life quietly, as most law books do. An 1849 Richmond printing of "The Code of Virginia," it was purchased by Fontaine Beckham (1788-1859), the railroad station agent at Harper''s Ferry, VA who doubled as a county magistrate. He inscribed his name "F. Beckham" on the spine. He was eventually elected mayor of Harper''s Ferry, and was as surprised as anyone by John Brown''s raid upon the town''s federal armory in October 1859. While Brown''s men were besieged in the famed engine house, they got off a shot at Mayor Beckham and killed him. A relative moderate on slavery by Virginia standards, Beckham had arranged to free his 5 slaves in his will. His death ironically led to the only slaves directly freed by Brown''s raid. <BR><BR>We don''t know who assumed ownership of Beckham''s books after his death. The Civil War raged through Harper''s Ferry several times. One unit which played a prominent role in the region was the 1st Maryland Cavalry Battalion, also known as the Potomac Home Brigade or Cole''s Cavalry. They dramatically evaded capture during the siege of Harper''s Ferry in September 1862, and then returned there on 6 July 1863. At some point, a member of Company D got their hands on Beckham''s old Code of Virginia. They defaced the title page, crossing out the words Virginia and Richmond, and then used it as a sort of company autograph book. 10 members signed the book, on its endpapers, flyleaf, and index leaves, often adding their ranks or unit name, and one adding the year 1864. Another inscribed "Loudoun Heights, Virginia," where the battalion fought in January 1864. <BR><BR>The book''s index shows dozens of entries which relate to "Negroes," "Emancipation," "Slaves," and "Patrols." Mayor Beckham likely knew most of those laws, but he probably never spent much time on page 722, which covers "If a free person advise or conspire with a slave to rebel or make insurrection"--and also defines another word which would become relevant shortly after his death: "Treason shall consist only in levying war against the state, or adhering to its enemies. . . .

  CROSSHEAD: Diary of a carpenter with the United States Military Railroad.
  at-a-glance: 'Tennessee and elsewhere, 1 January to 7 July 1864'
  TYPESET: >-
    107 manuscript diary pages, plus [16] pages of memoranda. 12mo, 5½ x 2¾
    inches, original limp calf, moderate wear; hinges split, entries in pencil
    and sometimes difficult to read with a few pages smudged.
  FOOTNOTE: ' Even if you have seen a few hundred Civil War diaries, you may not have seen one from the United States Military Railroad--the unheralded civilian contractors who restored and maintained the vital army-owned rail lines along the federal front. Our diarist was not a "solger" but he performed vital work for the military effort as a skilled carpenter. <BR><BR>Our diarist began by catching a train from Elmira, NY toward the front via Harper''s Ferry, Cincinnati, Louisville, Nashville, and Stevenson, AL. He arrived on 1 February in the recently captured city of Chattanooga on the Georgia border, which would become the supply base for Sherman''s Atlanta campaign in May. His crew was dispatched from Chattanooga to work on a nearby rail line. On 7 February he wrote "the boss detaled me to make a washboard. . . . After diner I went to flag trains. I don''t feel well yet for work, but can sit down one place as well as eny. I flaged until night." The labor gang was apparently not under tight military discipline; on 12 February he wrote "Some of the boys got an auger to boar a hole in log to put in blast, to have fun. It startled som of the boys. It raysed an excitement. Some fired a revolver and som sed blow out the lites." On 18 February he made a door and 12 axe handles. More typical would be long days in the woods transforming trees into railroad ties. Morale was poor; on 8 March he wrote "The men are a getting tired of this kind of treatment and say that they will not stay eney longer than the first of April, when they mean to start for Pensylvania, where they can enjoy free days and not be under bondage." On Sunday, 13 March, they put in a half day on the Sabbath: "We are in the woods halling ties on a cart, and some of them are a carry out by hand, good fellows to work, we all worked until noon and quit for the day." Two days later: "Stil in the woods as usual, fawling trees, roping and lineing, skoreing and hewing." <BR><BR>The crew was moved north to Nashville on 1 April, where our diarist helped erect a building for the commissary department, which seemed a better fit for his carpentry skills, and which he described in good detail. On 15 April he was "puting top on work bench and dresed up door stuff for pannel doors . . . and dressing stuff for windows sash." On 19 April he returned to Chattanooga to collect his pay, which took a week. On 23 April he wrote "Want to get away from this city. The mules are piled in heaps and stink aful, all threw the town." Back in Nashville, he continued to throw up buildings, noting that "solders came in by the swarms" on 30 May. On 6 June he helped raise a building for a machine shop. On 27 June he reported "Still in the city of Nashville, working with my tools for the goverment." He received his final pay on 7 July, and was nearly home by 9 July, concluding his diary. <BR><BR>The author was Jacob Krotzer (1817-1880) of Dunmore, PA, just east of Scranton. He signs and dates the volume on both flyleaves, and also at the bottom of page 53; he mentions his brother Sidney Krotzer on 17 April and 25 May. The first inscription on the front flyleaf reads "Care of C.L. McAlpine, Enginere US RR''ds." Charles LeGrand McAlpine (1828-1884) was a well-educated career engineer who served as the Engineer of Repairs for the City Point branch of the military railroad from July 1864 onward. McAlpine was very likely not the author of this diary--for one, he would have known how to spell "engineer." McAlpine also was not married in 1864--this diarist corresponds frequently with his wife.

Fish was assigned to a massive project to document Union gravesites throughout the South, so they could eventually be disinterred and consolidated into national cemeteries (see Swann''s 17 September 2015 auction, lot 87, for a related notebook kept by Fish). Amelia resided in Louisville, KY and in Stone Mountain, GA while Fish traveled widely; her letters are addressed to him in Corinth, MS (where he was stationed for a longer period), various locations in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Georgia, and occasionally further afield. The letters cover the period of their courtship and first year of their marriage. <BR><BR>This collection is also of potential philatelic interest.

  FOOTNOTE: ' Howell Cobb (1815-1868) of Georgia was President Buchanan''s Secretary of the Treasury, but became an avid secessionist while still holding federal office. Writing just weeks after the election of Abraham Lincoln had pushed secession talk to the fore, he describes a conversation with his fellow secessionist cabinet member John Floyd, former governor of Virginia and at that point the Secretary of War: "I receved your letter and . . . immediately called to see Gov. Floyd. He authorizes me to say to you that Col. Hardee shall have the additional leave of absence asked for." Lieutenant Colonel William J. Hardee of the 1st United States Cavalry Regiment would soon resign his commission to join the Confederacy. <BR><BR>Cobb continues, "It gives me great pleasure to do any thing in my power to advance the policy of our noble state in preparing to maintain out of the Union that equality & independence which there is no hope longer any hope of preserving in the Union. God speed her cause & strengthen her resolution." <BR><BR>Just two weeks later, on 8 December, Cobb resigned his position in the United States cabinet. In February, he was chosen president of the provisional congress of seceded states in Montgomery, AL, and was thus the de facto leader of the Confederacy until the election of Jefferson Davis as president the following year. Cobb then became a general in the Confederate Army, and remained in the field until after Appomattox.  '

Chafing under Bragg, he and other Texans eventually fled to reconstitute their original cavalry regiment in Texas. <BR><BR> After the war, as a general store keeper in Marshall, TX, Heartsill acquired an Octavo Novelty Press in December 1874 and began typesetting his journal page by page during slow moments at the store, printing a total of 100 copies of each page and then redistributing the type. He also solicited portraits of 61 of his comrades in arms, and made 100 prints of each, laying them down on special sheets with typeset captions. Bindings varied widely.

  FOOTNOTE: ' Caroline Elizabeth "Carrie" Weir (1840-1883) taught school in rural Elizabeth, IL and wrote frequently to her brother Lt. Frank Weir of the 96th Illinois Infantry, about to embark on the Atlanta Campaign. One of those letters went astray and was found by ambulance driver Marcus Walker (1843-1922) of the 141th New York Infantry, who wrote a joking response in which he pretended to know her friends. This began a charming correspondence which extended over the last year of the war. This lot consists of 7 of her letters to Marcus. <BR><BR>In her first letter on 8 March 1864, she expresses her love of teaching: "Don''t really feel at home any place more than in the school house with a lot of motley urchins swarming around me." She also announces that "you wrote to a girl about 5 ft 3 in. in height, rather heavy, blue eyes, dark brown or almost black hair & altogether I am about as good looking as any other half-sensible person." On 6 April, she inquires "Are you good at playing ball? I had a good game with the scholars today morn. I never played before, but I like it. I like almost anything that is fun." On 5 May she writes "I am a real farmer''s girl, like to be out romping around, can plant & husk corn, work in the garden & milk the cows & like nothing better that to get on a wild horse that will run away 2 or 3 times during a 5 mile ride." On 5 July she notes that her soldier brother was wounded in the face, but was back on duty. On 7 March 1865 she writes "I am learning a new piece to play when the boys come home. You must come here too when your time is out & I will play & sing it for you. It is called ''The Soldier''s Return.'' It is very pretty." In her final letter, 12 July 1865, she describes the grand reception for the 96th Illinois held in Galena, with dancing, singing, two 80-foot tables for the soldiers, 2000 guests, and "one cake made to represent Lookout Mountain." <BR><BR>We would very much like to report that Carrie and Marcus were wed later that year. However, she married later that year to a farmer named Robert Willson; Marcus married Belle Rose in 1872 and raised a family in his home town of Avoca, NY.  '

    Memoirs and correspondence of Jacob Duryee, who commanded the 2nd Maryland
    Infantry at Antietam.

    fasteners circa 1914, with occasional manuscript corrections and minimal

  FOOTNOTE: ' Jacob Eugene Duryee (1839-1918, also spelled Duryée or Duryea) was born into a distinguished old New York family. Days after the fall of Fort Sumter he enlisted in the 7th Regiment of the New York State Militia, the famed "Silk Stocking Regiment," which had been commanded by his father Abram Duryee (later a brigadier general). He was soon promoted to lieutenant in his father''s 5th New York, and then in September 1861 was made Lieutenant Colonel and de facto commander of the 2nd Maryland Infantry. At Antietam he led his regiment on a famously desperate attempt to cross Burnside''s Bridge, with 44% casualties. That same week, after the Governor of Maryland failed to visit his broken regiment at the hospital, he resigned his command in protest and left the army; he was later made a brevet brigadier general. <BR><BR>Offered here are 7 typescript sections of Duryee''s memoirs which he intended to make the basis of a book. One covers his earliest service in the New York regiments, including a short notice of his fellow private Robert Gould Shaw (later of 54th Massachusetts fame). Of most interest is the 53-page "Story of Burnside''s Bridge, Antietam, Maryland," which contains his heart-rending personal recollections of the battle, including the many dozens of dying men gathered in an old cow shed which functioned as a crude field hospital. A rumor spread that he had been killed in the battle with so many of his men, and a chaplain told him "General Warren has sent me for your body to send home to your mother." Duryee replied "Give my compliments to General Warren, and say to him he cannot have it." Also of interest is a separately bound 3-page section describing his resignation shortly after the battle, after consultation with General Burnside. <BR><BR>6 letters to and from Duryee are dated 1913 and 1914, all with later Silk Stocking Regiment members Daniel Appleton and Charles E. Lydecker regarding the regimental history; the portion relating to his New York service was apparently published in 1914 in the Seventh Regiment Gazette edited by Lydecker. Also included with the lot is a family genealogical manuscript, apparently written by Duryee and then expanded and typed by a descendant in 1970.  '

  FOOTNOTE: ' Charles Mather Smith (1842-1908) served as a corporal in the 1st Massachusetts Cavalry Regiment, which was present at several of the major battles of the war. The first extended portion of his memoir takes place on Beaufort Island, which his company occupied in January 1862. Wealthy planters had deserted their summer homes upon their approach, smashing and defacing their opulent furnishings as they left, "not willing that it should benefit our people" (page 4). The regiment was sent northward for the Maryland campaign, and saw their first heavy action at Antietam (pages 11-12), where his regiment supported an artillery battery which had crossed the Middle Bridge: "I never saw men work as those gunners did for about two or three hours, but they finally succeeded in silencing the enemy." He visited the battlefield and its fresh graves two weeks later, poignantly described in a note to page 15. <BR><BR>Smith''s company was detailed for a "daring little feat" on 17 October, a reconnaissance to the village of Smithtown where they just missed intercepting General Lee with his staff on a country road (pages 20-23). Smith''s horse collapsed from this effort, and he pays the loyal beast a touching page-long tribute. He visits Harpers Ferry and reflects on John Brown''s courage as well as the "wildest, grandest and most impressive" scenery (page 25). He describes hand-to-hand sabre combat at the Battle of Brandy Station, with Confederate officers shouting "Charge them! They are nothing but Massachusetts hirelings!" This was followed immediately by the Battle of Aldie which wiped out most of the 1st Massachusetts: "In about twenty minutes we had lost 154 killed wounded and missing. . . . I escaped unharmed, with the exception of a piece of flesh being cut from my finger, as I suppose, by a ball" (pages 47-49). His decimated regiment was held in reserve at Gettysburg two weeks later, but he reports on the "continual unbroken roar" which "seemed as if the elements of nature were convulsed" (page 50). The memoir ends with the 14 October 1863 Battle of Auburn, where a shell killed Smith''s horse instantly. He soon found a member of his company whose "side had been shot away by a shell which passed thro'' a man just in front of him. He died in about half an hour, and I mounted his horse and joined the company." Smith was captured the following month at the Battle of Mine Run and sent to Andersonville. He told that portion of his story in a separate narrative not included here: "From Andersonville to Freedom," published by the Rhode Island Soldiers and Sailors Historical Society in 1894. <BR><BR>The present memoir was originally written "during the winter following my return from the service," which would be the early months of 1865. The present manuscript is a clean transcript in an unidentified hand, with numerous revisions in Smith''s hand, as well as a new preface in his hand signed and dated 1885. The preface explains his motivation to instill the same kind of patriotism as the Revolutionary War narratives of his youth: "It is very strongly impressed upon my own mind that the Union cost something and meant something. If I can contribute anything to keep the fire of patriotism brightly burning, I am happy to do so." <BR><BR>WITH--a complete modern typed transcription of "What It Cost"; an 8-page typed tribute to Smith by John H. Jewett titled "Our Comrade Charles Mather Smith, a Sketch for By and By" dated 1901; and a lightly hand-colored uncased tintype portrait of Smith, 4 x 3¼ inches including frame, with paper caption label on verso and only minor wear. <BR><BR>This expansive memoir has apparently never been published, but has more than enough original historical detail and literary flair to warrant publication. Smith clearly wanted to share his story with the world, and it is not too late.  '

    postmarked envelopes (stamps removed).
  FOOTNOTE: ' "Every man who shows himself outside our works, draws down upon us a shower of bullets." <BR><BR>Daniel Harrison McPherson (1840-1864) of Caroline, NY near Ithaca served two years as a private in the 109th New York Infantry, from 1862 to 1864. The regiment spent its first 18 months doing light guard duty in the Washington area. Private McPherson complained bitterly about life under military discipline, and was arrested in March 1863 for a disagreement over his furlough. On 21 May 1863 he described a hometown friend in the regiment, Reuben Young, who was hospitalized with erysipelas: "He has been totally blind, but is better now . . . his face is swelled up pretty bad." He discusses the New York draft riots on 29 July: "They had a fine time in New York City & we expected to go there & shoot a few Copperheads as our regt. was the next one booked to go if more force was called for." <BR><BR>Daniel''s final letter is dated "In the rifle pits before Petersburg, Va., July 9th 1864," and reacts to the death of his brother-in-law George W. Roe (1831-1864), who was married to Daniel''s sister Sarah, and was drafted from the same town in 1863, joining Daniel in the 109th and returning home to die from an unspecified disease on 28 June 1864. The letter goes on to describe the Siege of Petersburg, where a fellow soldier named Jonathan Stamp was badly wounded: "He will lose his arm if not his life. The wound was made by a piece of shell striking his wrist, which it cut about one third off, arteries, cords, bone & all. The blood spurted out every time his heart beat & it was considerable trouble to stop it." The regiment was stationed on the second line, where "the enemy''s breastworks & forts tower high above us, where they can watch our every movement & every man who shows himself outside our works, draws down upon us a shower of bullets. . . . The well here where we draw water is in plain easy range of the Johnies & every day more or less is killed there. . . . This morning one of our Negro cooks was killed near the well. . . . Nearly every man who is wounded, let it be ever so slightly, dies. Mortification sets in in about four days & he is gone. There is some kind of green matter gets in the wound, litterly eating a man alive. Whole hospitals are cleared out by it in the course of one day." This was Daniel''s final letter in this collection; within a month he succumbed to typhoid fever in a Philadelphia hospital on 2 August 1864. <BR><BR>Also included are 5 letters from the unfortunate George W. Roe to his sister-in-law, August 1863 to March 1864. From Falls Church, VA on 25 November 1863, he describes the Virginia countryside: "The country all about here has been overcome by both armies & is consequently a barren waste. Fences have been destroyed & to the north, east & west from here the buildings have been burned or torn to pieces. Indeed, Virginia as a whole presents one wide waste of unproductive desolation." On 24 January 1864 he predicts at great length "the downfall of the rotten fabric of secession & the restoration of peace to our heretofore prosperous & happy country." His final letter, dated 4 March 1864, describes the botched plan of Union cavalry commander General Hugh Kilpatrick "to make a dash into Richmond, liberate our prisoners there, and if not able to hold it, burn the place & make good his retreat." <BR><BR>WITH--9 civilian letters from this family, 1863-1865.

The battery was on garrison duty outside of Washington for the first half of 1863, during which his most exciting diary entry was "Played a match game of ball" (21 February). Days after Gettysburg, though, the battery was dispatched in pursuit of Lee''s army. They camped on the Antietam battleground (10 July). At Wapping Heights on 23 July they had their first taste of combat: "Moved forward to attact Longstreet in Manassas Gap." On 29 August he noted "5 deserters shot today," and on 7 September the battery was reviewed by General Meade. At the start of the Bristoe Campaign on 13 October he noted "the Rebs are after us yet." They caught up with the Rebs at the Second Battle of Rappahannock Station, 7 November: "6 a.m., comenced to advance. Came into position on the Rapahannock and first our first gun at the Johnys.

For much of that time he was part of the besieged Union force at Suffolk, VA, writing "Continual cannonading kept up by our gunboats on the woods" (19 April) and "Fort Nansemond firing at the Rebs all the time" (1 May). He helped determine that the siege was lifted on 4 May with an epic march: "At 3 a.m. left camp in light marching order on the Somerton Road.

    regiment on front free endpaper, explaining that the diary was bought on 14
    March 1865 (with the earliest entries presumably transcribed from notes).
  FOOTNOTE: ' This humble diary traces the Siege of Petersburg and the Appomattox Campaign--and an unlikely love story. Leroy P. Deuel (1845-1927) was from Marion, NY, not far east of Rochester. He served as a private in the 9th New York Heavy Artillery, which mainly functioned as an infantry unit and saw heavy fighting though 1864 in the Overland and Shenandoah Valley campaigns. This diary opens with the Siege of Petersburg underway. On New Year''s Day, he was on picket when "two Jonies come in to our lines and give themselves up. . . . Went to Core headquarters with them." The next day "the Jonies made a raid on our picket pine, killed two & captured 23 of our boys & a good many knapsacks and blankets." On 7 February he reported that "5 p.m. Rebs made a charge on our line near Hatcher''s Run but were repulsed." His regiment was reviewed by General Meade on 7 March, and on the 11th he witnessed the execution of deserter James Kelley of the 67th Pennsylvania. On 23 March he wrote "A Lincoln was here today. The 2 Corps had a review." <BR><BR>On 25 March, Deuel reported on the Battle of Fort Stedman, a desperate Confederate attempt to break the siege: "The Jonies broke in to our lines on the right. We had orders to pack up every thing. The Battalion went to the rifle pits. They made a charge and took the picket line. Thare was 14 wounded in our Co." The next day, one of his company''s corporals was shot through the heart. Fort Stedman cleared the way for the events of 2 and 3 April which broke the back of the Confederacy: "Charged the enemy''s works, carrying them, & capturing many pieces of art''y & many prisoners, driving the enemy for some distance. . . . Richmond was entered this morning by our troops ½ 8 a.m." In the ensuing Appomattox campaign on 6 April, "drove the Jonies, captured old Lea''s son [General George Washington Custis Lee], Battle of Sailor''s Creek," and finally on 9 April "Gen. Lea surenderd his army today at 5 p.m. Thare was grate rejoicing in camp." As in countless other diaries from this month, the rejoicing was short-lived. On 18 April, "the news reached here that the Presedent was dead. It is tough." <BR><BR>From that point onward, camp life was sleepy. Most notably, on 10 May he wrote "Went to arest a Negro this evening. Got aquainted with a girl by the name of Louisa Nucom." Then on 18 May he decided to be more discreet: "Went into the contry to see the girls, had a fine time with J.W.G., L.W.N." In the back of the volume, his sweetheart Louisa W. Newcomb of Mossingford, VA signs three times, adding "May ever blessing be thy lot, I only ask, Forget me not." Deuel did not muster out of service until 29 September, and the diary ends on 5 October with his arrival in Manhattan and a speech by Governor Reuben Fenton.<BR><BR>Deuel spent the rest of his long life as a farmer in his hometown of Marion. In 1869, he married Louisa Newcomb (1844-1925)--the girl he met on garrison duty back in Virginia. They remained married for 56 years and raised two children. <BR><BR>The war diary is accompanied by two later diaries of similar size written in Marion in 1867: one by Leroy, and one by Leroy''s mother Nancy Keeler Deuel (1819-1896). Mother Deuel was a better-than-average chronicler of small-town life. Also included is a worn and incomplete 1835 printing of Union Hymns in the same size.  '

    Approximately [76], [80] manuscript diary pages, plus 17 other items, in one
    folder; diaries quite worn and likely missing pages, one completely
    disbound.
  FOOTNOTE: ' "We held our ground 3 howers, runout of amunition and fell back. . . " <BR><BR>Andrew Jackson Raub (1836-1919), a farm laborer from Bucyrus, OH, enlisted in the 3-month 8th Ohio Infantry Regiment early in the war, stayed with them when they were reorganized as a 3-year regiment, but was discharged with a disability on 19 October. He then on 12 November 1861 enlisted as a corporal in the 15th Michigan Infantry under the name Jackson Raub. He remained with them until almost the end of the war. Raub was barely literate, and wrote mostly short sporadic entries. His first diary, covering 1861, has almost no content of interest. His second diary is a packet of disbound sheets, likely with some leaves missing. However, Raub did have some interesting things to say, including one long combat passage. <BR><BR>Raub saw his first heavy combat at Shiloh, here noted only briefly: "Arrived at Pittsbarg Tennisee on the 5 day of April 1862, in tow days fiting on the 6 and 7 of April 1862 gaind the day." He had more to say about the lead-up to the Battle of Corith, which he begins on "September 31th": "Atact, tow men wounded, and reinforsed by the 17 and 18 Wisconstent and tow 10-pound cannon. 15th [Michigan] deployed as scermishers, 17 and 18 and artilery runs, leeves us surounded." The next day, "cut our way out, burnt our clothing for saftey," and then "fitting and fall back by the insh towards Corinth." On the days of the battle proper, he filled more than 2 pages: "We gaind a smawl bluf, opend fire on the enemy. We had 1 cannon, 500 men, the enemy 6 brigades. We held our ground 3 howers, runout of amunition and fell back, seen the enemey''s black flag. We then ralleyd and 17 and 18 Wis and us, we charged on the enemy for life, drove them back in to the wodds." After the fighting, "we got the first bit to eat and first watter to drink we had for 4 days, and plenty of whiskey" (4 October). <BR><BR>Raub struggled with illness for the remainder of his service. On 21-22 August 1863 he wrote: "Sick, A.J. Raub lung fever. The collonel orders evry sick man out to do duty. 6 men of Co. E refuse, not able to obey the orders. Sick in tent, lung feever and the bluddy disentery and cramps but on duty, damd the doctor kills his men wit his duty." On 2 September 1863 he notes a "grand review today by Genrel Shermon." We perhaps should not take this 28 November 1863 menu literally: "Very poor breakfast, eal hash and stewed rats." His final entry was written in a Memphis hospital on 27 January 1864 while contemplating his fate--by far his longest entry at 5 pages, reflecting on his service: "I was under arest onst by the officer of the guard for arguing the scripturs. He said the Prodestins ware all hore masters and hoears, and the Catholicks ware the only cherch that sirved God & I told him that they sirved calves and engravin imeges. . . . I apeeled to Jenrell Shermon and . . . sene my antagnist casheerd and dishonorable discharged. His naim was John Maran, capton of Company G, 15 Mich." Raub was a better artist than a writer. Both diaries are embellished with several doodles, including crossed bayonets to start and close the 1861 diary. <BR><BR>Accompanying the diary are a group of related family papers. A set of 5 photographs includes a tintype of a very intense-looking soldier bearing a rifle, who we believe to be Raub. A postwar photograph of the same man and his wife was taken by a photographer in his hometown of Bucyrus, and another tintype shows the same young woman (presumably his wife Alice Gillespie Raub); the other two photographs may show their children. An 1842 Ohio land grant certificate is docketed as filed by Raub in 1884, and a worn 1880 circular relates to his pension claim. A clipping of his 1919 obituary from the Bucyrus Evening Telegraph clarifies his biography and adds that "He was wounded in action and carried the bullet which struck him to the end of his life," and he spent his final decades in the Toledo State Hospital for the Insane. Also included are 3 small memorandum books of son Jackson C. Raub (1873-1937) of Bisbee, AZ, including a volume of safe combinations from 1904 to 1912--he was apparently a locksmith.  '

    8 manuscript letters (4 of them on patriotic letterhead), various sizes,

  FOOTNOTE: ' Alfred A. Laughlin (circa 1844-1862) lived in Germantown in southwestern Ohio. The earliest letter in this lot is dated 13 January 1862 from two hometown friends who enlisted before Laughlin: James Gunckel and Abiah Z. Hoffman of the 35th Ohio Infantry, then in camp in Kentucky. Gunckel strongly encourages Laughlin to enlist: "If you woud a went with me, I think you woud see more then you wood by staing at home, and wood have plenty to eat and to wear, and plenty of foun in the camp, and git 13 dolers a month, and won''t haf to dow enny thing."<BR><BR>Laughlin soon joined the 112th Ohio, which never reached full strength and was merged into the 63rd Ohio Infantry. The lot includes 5 letters he wrote to his parents David and Susan in Germantown from September to December 1862. The last letter, dated 7 December, is from the front near Corinth, MS, where his regiment expected to face off soon against Confederate general Sterling Price: "Sunday we could here the cannon roar all day. There are troops enough around here to eat old Price and all his men. A deserter from Price''s army came in here yesterday. He says that the most of the soldiers'' time is up, and they won''t fight any more." <BR><BR>Laughlin died of dysentery in camp later that month. The lot concludes with two letters from men in his regiment to the grieving parents. Francis Emley tries to give his best account of Laughlin''s final days: "He did not appear to suffer much pain and he died very easy. . . . Thank God he died in a glorious cause, that cause was for the old flag, that ower forefathers fought for. . . . Alford was buried very nice, for I helped to dig his grave, and I know that it was don right." The company captain George Wightman followed up in September with advice on securing Laughlin''s effects and final pay. '

  TYPESET: >-
    13 items in one box, generally with moderate wear except as noted, most
    significantly two diaries written as an enlisted man from September 1862 to
    May 1865: [28], [37] manuscript diary pages plus memoranda, 16mo (4½ x 3
    inches) in worn original calf, second diary lacking at least two diary
    leaves, other leaves coming loose with moderate wear.
  FOOTNOTE: ' "Many straglers who had taken too much apple jack straggled away from regiment and were captured by girillas.” <BR><BR>John Scowcroft Settle (circa 1839-1917) was born in England and came with his parents to the Frankford neighborhood of Philadelphia as a boy. He enlisted in the 121st Pennsylvania Infantry in August 1862; the regiment saw heavy fighting at Fredericksburg, Gettysburg and the siege of Petersburg, all described in his diaries. The entries are mostly short and of modest literary quality, but his humor and poetic nature shine through in spots--and he was a witness to history. <BR><BR>The first diary begins shortly after the regiment was mustered, in September 1862. On 30 October he wrote "Thus began our Va campaign under Gen’l Burnside. I only hope it may be successful.” Their first taste of combat was at Fredericksburg, where he wrote "the Rebels gave us shot and shell in front of the Reb batteries, many a gallant soldier fell" (13 December). For four days in January he noted Burnside''s abortive offensive against Richmond, the infamous Mud March--or as Settle wrote on 20 January 1863, “Marched on what is called the Mud Skedadle." He briefly describes his movements at Chancellorsville from 20 April to 4 May, and then to start July he describes the Battle of Gettysburg: "Came off picket, the battle commenced about 1 mile from Gettysberg. The Rebs drove us about 1 mile on the 1st day. I was wounded in the left arm and right shoulder but not bad. . . . Our forces drove the enemy at all points and many prisoners taken. . . .Our men re-took Gettysburg.” Left for a Philadelphia hospital shortly after the battle, where he continued with sporadic entries through May 1864. <BR><BR>Settle''s second diary begins in September 1864, when he is released from the hospital and returns to his regiment, then engaged in the Siege of Petersburg. On 30 September and 1 October he describes the related Battle of Peebles''s Farm: "Our First Division captured a fort. We then advanced and threw up breastworks. . . . Early the Rebs moved on and drove our brigade from behind the breastworks. We then went to the rear and threw up others.” He served as a clerk for the regiment''s participation in the presidential election on 11 October, and records a strong showing for the "Union" over the Democrats. At the Battle of Boydton Plank Road, “Moved at 4 a.m. and were engaged with the Rebs at 3 p.m. We got lost with firing on every side, battalion of sharpshooters capt[ured]" (28 October). A raid to destroy Confederate transportation and supplies concluded on 10 December: "The 2nd Brigade in the rear charged by girillas. 14 girillas killed by charging on the cavalry through brigade. Barnes, houses, hay stacks and churches destroyed by our troops but destroying the church was condemned by all. Many straglers who had taken too much apple jack straggled away from regiment and were captured by girillas.” <BR><BR>Settle suffered his second wound at the Battle of Hatcher''s Run on 6 February 1865: "At 1 p.m. engaged the rebels, they driving our 1 Brigade, ours charged on them and drove them back, but not without heavy loss on our side. We ware finally driven back to the breastworks and they checked the enemy. I received a slight wound on the arm and went to the rear. The same ball struck my hatchet and glanced and passed through my cap.” He was back on picket the next day, and fought at the pivotal Battle of Fort Stedman on 26 March, where he noted a "truce of 3 hrs for the parties to bury their dead wich are about equal in numbers.” After that, the rebels were on the run. On 9 April, he writes “Reported surrender of Lee’s army. Ours drawn up in line of battle. All kinds of reports, not knowing wich is the right one. Capture of an ammense number of prisoners.” The leaf which must have noted Lincoln''s assassination is missing; the diary concludes shortly after the Grand Review of 23 May. This second diary also includes two pages of primitive drawings of corps flags in Meade’s Army of the Potomac, as well as his division''s and brigade''s flags; and also a two-page song titled “Happy Land of Canaan,” apparently unpublished, commenting on the start of the war. <BR><BR>The diaries contain frequent mention of letters to or from Alice; John and Alice married in 1865 not long after he mustered out. They raised a large family in Leeds, MD, where he ran a general store. Included with Settle''s Civil War diary are a small collection of personal papers: <BR><BR>His letter to future wife Alice. "I suppose you begin to think by my former letters that I was begining to be a secesh . . . decived by our generals &c was enough to make us so, but with good treatment we are begining to be as patriotic as ever. Old Joe Hooker is making us all into regulars, blackened shoes &c. . . The change is for the better. Every one thinks Old Joe is going to win." 4 pages; dampstaining. Belle Plain, VA, 1 April 1863. <BR><BR>Four versions of Settle''s poem "The Frankford Boys" recounting his company''s achievements at Gettysburg and elsewhere. It begins "All honor to the loyal boys / That wore the Union blue" and each verse ends with "The Frankford boys were there." Present are a clipping of a newspaper publication dated 13 December 1909; a partial typescript dated 1911; a manuscript dated 1915; and an undated typescript. <BR><BR>An incomplete post-1890 pension application in Settle''s name citing "gunshot wound of left fore-arm, general debility and debility naturally due to age." <BR><BR>A carte-de-visite portrait of Settle''s grandfather(?) John Scowcroft of Harwood, England. <BR><BR>Settle''s 1860 pocket diary signed in Manayunk, PA. The entries are mostly brief and of little consequence. On 20 March he attended a debate at his local lyceum: "Question debated was, Has a state a right to secede from the Union?" At least one entry was added in 1861, noting the Battle of Port Royal on 15 November. <BR><BR>"History of the 121st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers by the Survivors'' Association." 292 pages; moderate wear. Private Settle is listed on page 281; he has inscribed the volume on the flyleaf. Philadelphia, 1893. <BR><BR>Finally, a sixth-plate cased ambrotype portrait (3¼ x 2¾ inches) in strong condition of a young man, presumed to be Settle, holding an American flag. He wears a ribboned beret and has another ribbon on his breast. <BR><BR>These diaries and the related papers offer a portrait of a patriotic humble soldier with an edge of sarcasm. They are apparently unpublished and unrecorded. Additional notes on the diaries are available upon request.  '

In 1871 he married Carrie Clark, but they were soon separated. She became linked with star baseball pitcher Charles "Old Hoss" Radbourn by 1884, and they were married in 1895.

  FOOTNOTE: ' This view depicts Cumberland Gap at the junction of the Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee borders, a heavily traveled thoroughfare for western migration and a strategic objective during the war. The Union finally gained control in September 1863. This view was drawn from the southeast on the Tennessee side, with the sprawling encampment of the 91st Indiana Infantry in the foreground, with its commissary, tents, and dress parade in progress; as well as the headquarters of General Kenner Garrard, a cavalry commander in the Army of the Cumberland, and the post''s hospital, commissary, and guard house. Commanding the heights in the background are batteries of artillery regiments from Ohio, Michigan, and Tennessee. Framed at center is the gap, with the American flag flying high, captioned "Long may she wave, we''ll keep her there or die." A small marker at the crossroads is captioned: "That blue stone in the Gap is the corner stone of Virginia, Ky and Tenn." The sun sinking to the left helps to establish the orientation. <BR><BR>The 91st Indiana was stationed at Cumberland Gap from January to May 1864. The artist was Francis Adolph Thuis (1837-1898), who was raised in the Netherlands and came to Vincennes, IN as a young man in 1857. He enlisted in Company A of the 91st Indiana Infantry but was detailed as a musician. After the war he was a harness-maker in Vincennes, and remained active in music with his church chorus. He made at least one other nearly identical version of this view, which is held by the Indiana Historical Society.  '

They drafted and signed this statement, insisting that "the custom of burying Euclid is time-honored" and "should be regarded as a class matter, each acting the part assigned to him by his class, assuming of course no individual responsibility." The statement was intended to serve as a sort of letter of reference, insisting that the suspension should not be regarded as a blight on French''s character. <BR><BR>Asa French (1829-1903) of Braintree, MA was reinstated, graduated with the Class of 1851, and went on to a long law career; he was active in alumni affairs.

    as published in the New-Haven Gazette, and the Connecticut Magazine," Volume
    I, No. 9. Pages [65]-72. 4to, 9¾ x 8½ inches, disbound; moderate foxing.
  FOOTNOTE: ' This deadpan satirical piece notes the discovery of a "race of negroes in the middlemost parts of Africa who are as white as snow," and posits the evolution in the other direction of white laborers being transformed into negroes by large-scale economic forces. The descent of the white laborer into slavery had long been blamed on the oppressive policies of Great Britain. The continuance of this process under American liberty is thus ascribed by the author to the "design of natures." His satire seems to implicate public debt and high taxation for the degradation of free labor. <BR><BR>This essay is credited to "Lycurgus," which was the pen name of the Gazette''s editor Josiah Meigs; he wrote other satirical pieces under this name. This is the essay''s first and possibly only appearance in print. It is discussed at length in Jared Gardner''s "Master Plots: Race and the Founding of an American Literature, 1787-1845," pages 15-17.  '

  CROSSHEAD: 'Papers of the Macomber family, seed merchants of Portsmouth, Rhode Island.'

  TYPESET: >-
    Approximately 800 items neatly sleeved and organized in 15 binders (3.5
    linear feet); condition generally strong, many of the letters accompanied by
    original stamped envelopes.
  FOOTNOTE: ' Joseph Ellwood Macomber (1822-1906) was raised in Vermont, and taught school in Farmington, NY and Portsmouth RI as a young man. He eventually established a successful strawberry farm and seed distribution business in Portsmouth, and was an active member of the Society of Friends (Quakers). Offered here are the extensive personal and business papers of Joseph and his sons Isaac Borden Macomber (1852-1938) and William Penn Macomber (1854-1885). <BR><BR>Letters and inventories relating to Macomber''s seed business fill three binders, with letters dated from 1854 to 1875. They are arranged by customer, with regular correspondents including seed retailers in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Boston, and beyond. Produce dealers Sweet & Arnold in Providence were regular buyers of his strawberries in the 1860s. Also included are 3 broadside advertisements for Macomber''s Fertilizer Distributor, developed by son Ellwood Gassett Macomber. <BR><BR>Personal letters to Joseph Ellwood Macomber span from 1852 to 1876 in 3 binders. A letter to his wife is on the elaborate letterhead of the Elmira Water Cure while he was under treatment there in 1854. The family as Quakers did not fight in the Civil War, but certainly grappled with the issues of the day. Brother William Macomber (1832-1918) wrote in 6th Month 1863 "I have one scholar who lost an arm in the battles under Gen. Pope in Virginia. . . . There may be a draft, but I do not now feel as tho'' I could consistently take up arms to destroy that which God has created on purpose for his own glory." <BR><BR>Letters addressed to Isaac Borden Macomber dated 1868 to 1877, plus other ephemera, fill 2 binders. He attended the Friends School in Providence, and then received a business degree at the Mowry & Goff School in Providence, before returning to farm in his home town of Portsmouth. Among his correspondents were brother William, a Yale student (see below). <BR><BR>Letters addressed to William Penn Macomber and a handful of other documents fill 4 binders extending from 1870 to 1877, mostly from friends and family while he was enrolled at the Providence Friends School (Moses Brown School) and Yale University, graduating in 1877. Many of the letters are from his sister Lizzie while she was at the Friends School. Highlights include a small manuscript map of the Yale campus, and seven of his juvenile Friends School essays from 1868, including "Base-Ball," describing the rules of the new national game: "Base-ball is a very healthy sport and there are but few who do not like it. It is not only healthy but amusing." <BR><BR>Last are 3 binders of miscellaneous letters and documents, mostly invoices and other business records. A strawberry sales memoranda book from 1863 and 3 bank books are included. William Macomber discusses a grisly murder in his hometown of Chelsea, Michigan in a 16 September 1863 letter. An untitled pencil property map shows a house, grape arbor, barn, well, and dozens of trees. 16 reports from the school districts of Portsmouth are dated 1858-1859. One of the binders consists of estate records from 1917-1919, otherwise the entire collection dates from the narrow window of 1852 to 1877.  '

  FOOTNOTE: ' This poster from the very early years of commercial motion pictures advertises an exhibition of "life-size views of life and motion . . . illustrating our new possessions and Free Cuba," in the wake of the Spanish-American War. An "Optigraph Moving Picture Machine" projected animated pictures on a screen, interspersed with 52 still views projected with the more established stereopticon technology. The Philippines, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico are all featured. <BR><BR>It might seem odd that Sears & Roebuck would be publishing an exhibition broadside. They produced and marketed early film projectors and films, with independent exhibitors as their intended audience, promising that "you have no boss or bosses, you conduct the business to suit yourself." See David Nasaw''s 1999 book "Going Out: The Rise and Fall of Public Amusements" (page 142). The posters were apparently produced to accompany the projectors so exhibitors could start advertising their performances without delay. The first reference we find to an actual performance was in the Chadron Record in rural Nebraska, 21 July 1899: "A right royal entertainment is promised to be given in Nelson''s opera house tomorrow night when the wonderful animated or moving picture exhibition will be given."

The rounded 1883-1884 number, 350,000 barrels, appears to be projected. The contents are lively: a "Message to our Patrons," a display of counterfeit labels, illustrations of satellite breweries in Arkansas, Wyoming and Texas; a centerfold spread of their 1883 gold medal certificate; and a 3-page price list for their various brews: Anheuser-Busch Standard, Liebotschaner, Erlanger, Pale Lager, Faust Beer, and "the Budweiser beer," offered by the bottle or keg.

  FOOTNOTE: ' As Secretary of Treasury under the new Constitution, Hamilton did not submit formal budgets for 1789 or 1790, so this report was the first formal budget ever submitted to Congress for its review. <BR><BR>The report does not have a title page.

This is followed by Hamilton''s short introduction, which concludes with an apology for the growing Treasury Department bureaucracy, explaining that officials went through so much stationery that they could not possibly cover the expense out of their modest salaries. The budget itself begins with the salaries of all federal employees, headed by President Washington at $25,000. The Treasury Department''s budget dwarfed that of the departments of State and War, who employed only 7 men each, although the actual military force is listed separately (as submitted by Henry Knox).

In this case, a butcher named Weeden was charged with refusing the inflationary paper currency, and was represented by United States Congressman (and Continental Army general) James Mitchell Varnum, who convinced the court to refuse to enforce the unconstitutional legislation. This case was later cited as precedent in the 1803 United States Supreme Court case Marbury v. Madison, which established the principle of judicial review.

  FOOTNOTE: ' Benjamin Henry Grierson (1826-1911) was a musician and composer in Illinois before the Civil War. He wrote this Lincoln campaign song to the tune of "Old Dan Tucker" for his local Wide Awakes chapter in Meredosia, about 50 miles west of Springfield. The words are unequivocally anti-slavery, accusing the Democrats of bowing "to slavery''s dark command" and hoping "the barbarous slave-trade to revive." Prognosis: "Dug''s legs are short and he can''t travel / Old Abe will make them all scratch gravel. . . . We''ll send old Abe to Washington / Before they can secede or run / He''ll let the wind out of their sails / And fence them in with walnut rails." <BR><BR>During the war to follow, Grierson became (somewhat improbably) a distinguished Union cavalry general, and then an enthusiastic leader of a Buffalo Soldier regiment after the war.

The play was "The Marble Heart; or, The Sculptor''s Dream," a Charles Selby translation of a French play. <BR><BR>Booth continued a national tour in this role, including a stop at Washington''s Ford Theatre nine months later on 9 November. President Lincoln, who saw Booth perform several times over the years, was in attendance. Booth did not shoot anyone that night, but he was just a little creepy. As one friend of Lincoln''s recalled, "Twice Booth in uttering disagreeable threats in the play came very near and put his finger close to Mr. Lincoln''s face; when he came a third time I was impressed by it, and said, ''Mr. Lincoln, he looks as if he meant that for you.'' ''Well,'' he said, ''he does look pretty sharp at me, doesn''t he?''" (Katherine Helm, "The True Story of Mary, Wife of Lincoln," page 243).

The letter he wrote to his father the next day is one of the best eyewitness accounts of the Lincoln assassination. He went on to a distinguished medical career in New Jersey and Chicago.  '

Most notably, the shield in the lower left corner bears only the 15 stars of Washington''s time, rather than the 35 stars of the union which Lincoln had worked so hard to restore. The badges of the Society of Cincinnati and the Freemasons hanging from the tomb were also far more appropriate for Washington than for Lincoln.

  FOOTNOTE: ' George Gordon Sampson (1878-1973) was born and raised in a farming family in central Maine, in the towns of Temple and nearby Farmington. He began this diary before his eighth birthday, and even then was engaged in farm work--on 2 January 1886 he proudly noted "yoked the steers today." By age 12 he was collecting maple sap and hauling birch timber (see illustration). He went off to nearby Bates College in September 1901, recording his studies as well as glee club meetings and athletic events, graduating in 1905 and removing to West Upton, MA. His father died in 1907, and by 1910 he was living in Worcester, MA with his widowed mother and his sister Angeleen, a musician. There he pursued a master''s degree at Clark University and taught high school physics. After the conclusion of this diary, he married in 1918 and continued to teach in Worcester.  '

    Brig Young America of Plymouth, D V Pool master, entering the Port of Malta,
    March 22d 1862."
  FOOTNOTE: ' The brig Young America was a merchant vessel which sailed out of Plymouth, MA from at least 1856 to 1863. David Vining Pool (1823-1884) of Plymouth took command as master in 1857. On this 1862 voyage, the Young America sailed from Cardiff, Wales, arrived in Malta on 22 March, and sailed on to Palermo, Italy a week later, per the New York Daily Herald of 17 April 1862. Malta was at that point a protectorate in the British Empire; the British flag can be seen flying at the fortress in the background. Although the two nations remained major trade partners, relations between the United States and Great Britain were tense at that point because of the crown''s flirtation with recognition of the Confederacy. <BR><BR>Historical context aside, this unattributed painting is an attractive image, with the ship''s name and the American flag giving it a strong patriotic flair.

Cannon has this proposal drafted and notarized to protect himself legally whether these claims proved valid or not. He requested that the two men file formal evidence of their authority and pay him "reasonable satisfaction for the damage . . . I suffer by quitting my imployment"--or provide him with security to protect him against the owner''s claims if their authority proved bogus. Barring that, Cannon "declare my selfe under a necessity to fit out and imploy the ship according to the best advice and incouragement that I can receive from others and to give the owners acc''t of . . . my proposals and the cours I may be constrayned to take." <BR><BR>The Boston Public Library holds a related deposition "concerning Robert Cannon, Mathew Johnson, and the ship Dove" dated 10 October 1675.

  FOOTNOTE: ' The Albany Hospital was built in 1754 to treat soldiers in the French and Indian War. The large building was pressed back into service in 1776 to treat Continental troops in the wake of the failed Canada campaign. Local physician Joseph Young (1735-1814), who had been a regimental surgeon, took command of the hospital in 1778. His 1800 book "A New Physical System of Astronomy" is sometimes described as the first medical textbook written in America. <BR><BR>This account lists Young''s expenses in running the hospital from 1782 to 1784, for which he was reimbursed in June 1784 by the young Continental government. The main sheet lists forage rations for his horses from 23 July 1782 to April 1784, as well as $35.62 in cash expended in early 1784, offset against $16 he received from the sale of an iron stove. Attached is a smaller sheet breaking down the 41 cash expenditures totaling $35.62, mostly for deliveries of wood, but also for beef, bread, sweeping chimneys, carting hay, and two patient transactions: "Jno. Bogart taking 2 patients to New York, Reubens & Wheeler" and "Joshua Colwill, passage of John Chase and wife."

    legibility.
  FOOTNOTE: ' John Lincoln Clem (1851-1937) ran away from home and joined the 22nd Michigan Infantry as a drummer boy. He not only wielded a rifle at the Battle of Chickamauga, he was said to have shot a Confederate colonel who demanded his surrender. He was then promoted to sergeant at the age of 12, the youngest non-commissioned officer in American history. Cartes-de-visite of the diminutive sergeant were popular during the war. After returning home and graduating from high school, he failed to gain admission to West Point, but President Grant appointed him as a second lieutenant in 1871. By 1915, he was the last Civil War veteran on active duty, and was brevetted as a brigadier general upon his retirement. <BR><BR>Clem wrote this letter in reaction to a mix-up at his hotel during a visit to San Antonio, which he blamed on "the carelessness of your servants, who put my name on Dr. Beers'' mattress, & his on mine." Thus Clem lost his blankets and quilt, and was sent away with the other guest''s expensive field glasses: "I was very much surprised to get your bill with note, saying Dr. Beers did not owe me any money, but that he would pay me if I returned his field glass--just as though I had stolen it. . . . I am placed in a bad--very bad--light and I wish to have it cleared up. It makes me a thief in the light which you put it." Clem was eager to defend his reputation and get the matter sorted out; an accusation of theft could have potentially stalled his military career.  '

It protests tax policy, the power of sheriffs to arrest delinquents without due process, the seizure of the property of non-residents, and more. Notably, "we present as a grievance the taxing of batteaux and boats carrying above twenty barrels, as it will thereby prevent the freighting our produce and necessities to and from New Orleans in our own bottoms to the manifest injury of our own people employed in that line." They also complain of the "ruinous state of the roads and bridges throughout the whole of this territory to the great shame and neglect of an industrious and civilized people." <BR><BR>On page 5 they complain that "a proper white person is not appointed as an Indian Inspector which has hitherto been effected by a Negro slave to the great shame of a free and independent people." They demand "qualified persons . . . to visit and examine the several public and private cotton gins throughout this territory." <BR><BR>Disorder in Natchez is a particular source of concern. They complain of the "great number of idle and disorderly people who assemble and meet at the different public houses in the town of Natchez on the Sabbath" and allowing "Negro slaves &c to play about the fences of the out lots at cards, dice and chuck penny upon the above day." <BR><BR>They conclude by reminding that "it was not a matter of choice our coming into this territory as belonging to the United States" but they still remained "a people descended from the same stock, possessing the same principles and animated with the same desire of freedom." The names of 17 signers are appended. <BR><BR>This petition was published in The Territorial Papers of the United States, Volume 5, pages 63-66, from another copy in the Timothy Pickering Papers at Massachusetts Historical Society.

    Autograph Letter Signed to brother Absalom Koiner. 4 pages, 10 x 7¾ inches,

  FOOTNOTE: ' Jonathan Koiner (1820-1889) of Flatwoods, WV and his brother Absalom went on a western tour in 1855 to scout potential emigration destinations. Absalom quite abruptly stepped off a steamboat in northern Iowa, leaving Jonathan to continue alone. Most of this letter describes his travels in Missouri: from Hannibal by hack to Paris, and then 25 miles on foot to Mexico. There he saw a prairie fire, a bustling courthouse with judges and lawyers chomping on cigars, and several relatives of his wife''s. From there, it was 30 miles by carriage to Columbia, "the Athens of the state, where the state university is situated & several fine female institutions." At Marshall, his westernmost point, he saw the 300-acre hemp farm of a man named Bruce who "has a good many slaves, but he is one of the largest hemp growers in the U.S." He also witnessed "scores of wild cranes & wild geese one cloudy day in the corn fields above Marshall." He met the well-known pro-slavery jurist William Barclay Napton, "the great antagonist of T.H. Benton"; former governor Meredith Miles Marmaduke; and numerous extended family members and friends who had already made the move west. On his way home, he was inspired by St. Louis and Cincinnati, with their "living moving masses of men & things!" He concludes with his decision to sell his Virginia land and move his young family west. Census records suggest that he never went.  '

  TYPESET: >-
    119 items in one sleeve; condition generally strong with a few items worn or

  FOOTNOTE: ' James Ferdinand Mallinckrodt (1842-1921) was born in Missouri and spent most of his life in St. Louis as part of a distinguished extended German-American family; his Mallinckrodt second cousins founded a famous pharmaceutical firm. James served the Union as a lieutenant in the 17th Missouri Infantry during the Civil War, and then embarked on an eclectic career as a machinist, draughtsman, and scientific model-maker. He also styled himself a literary figure, publishing several pamphlets and frequent letters to the editor, and corresponding with famous authors. In 1915 he removed to Salt Lake City to live with his brother and nephew; he is not thought to have been a Mormon. <BR><BR>This lot includes 74 retained drafts of letters sent by Mallinckrodt, almost all of them from 1868 to 1882. 27 of them are to the noted abolitionist clergyman Henry Ward Beecher from 1879 to 1882, and several more are to Theodore Tilton, 1870-1874; Beecher and Tilton were antagonists in a famous love triangle which was national news in the mid-1870s. At least one of the letters to Tilton mentions free-love advocate and presidential candidate Victoria Woodhull, who also featured in the scandal. 5 letter drafts are to famed Scottish philosopher and historian Thomas Carlyle from 1878, and another was addressed to theologian Charles Carroll Everett .<BR><BR>This lot''s 27 letters received by Mallinckrodt are dated 1862 to 1872 and (mostly) 1897 to 1917. Just one has Civil War content, which a civilian friend wrote in 1862, complaining that Mallinckrodt''s letter had taken 39 days to arrive: "It must have traveled about as fast as McClellan''s army before Manassas." His closing evokes the favorite general of all German-Americans: "As long as you ''fights mit Sigel'' I am your friend." Socialist labor activist William Krech of Minneapolis wrote a very long and intellectually dense letter in 1872. <BR><BR>Rounding out the collection are 16 family letters written in German, 1806-1918; Mallinckrodt''s 1874 manuscript essay "Is St. Louis Prepared for the Manufacture of Locomotives?"; and a carte-de-visite of "H.M. at 67," most likely father Herman Mallinckrodt circa 1877.

  FOOTNOTE: ' Project MKUltra was an extremely controversial covert Central Intelligence Agency program which ran from 1953 to 1973, attempting to develop new techniques for brainwashing and torture. Most memorably, agents delivered high doses of LSD to unwitting or coerced participants including mental institution inmates, convicted criminals, and even CIA operatives, resulting in several deaths by suicide. In addition to LSD, hundreds of other drugs were tested for possible use in mind control and other objectives. In the wake of the Watergate scandal in 1973, the secret program was scuttled and most of its records destroyed, but a 1974 New York Times exposé brought the program to the attention of the public. A cache of surviving records was discovered which formed the basis for this 3 August 1977 joint hearing of the Senate''s Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on Human Resources. It remains a seminal document of one of the CIA''s most disturbing chapters. No examples traced at auction.  '

  FOOTNOTE: ' Arthur Curtis Silvers (1870-1946) married Lucy A. Wright (1869-1961) in 1900. They had two children, Jessie Fern Silvers (1902-1986) (married to Wal Gustafson) and Arthur Curtis Silvers Jr. (1909-1914). They spent most of their married life in the neighboring villages of Walker and Nevada in Walker County, on the western border of Missouri near the Kansas line. Curtis was an elder in his local branch of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (now known as the Community of Christ). He was employed as a missionary in the Missouri-Kansas region, and after his retirement circa 1935, was a tour guide at the Church''s auditorium in Independence, the town where both he and Lucy spent their final days living at the church''s sanitarium.<BR><BR>These diaries were mostly kept in paperback school composition books, about 8 x 7 inches. Lucy''s 1919-1920 diary bears a cover photograph of Philadelphia baseball player Eddie Collins, although we see no other indication that she was a baseball fan. The births of their children are discussed on 20 December 1902 and 2 November 1909. The 27 August 1914 entries discuss the death of their 4-year-old son. Curtis''s diary of 26 July to 6 August 1931 describes a long driving trip with stops at the Washington Monument, Manhattan, Niagara Falls, and the LDS historic town of Kirtland, OH. The diary is largely devoted to church and family. Major events such as the stock market crash of 1929 go unremarked, although Pearl Harbor is noted in passing by Lucy ("word came that Japan has made war on the U.S.") On the other hand, one of the longer entries in Curtis''s diary was on 14 April 1915, discussing a succession in the church''s leadership: "Bro. Frederick Madison Smith, eldest son of Pres Joseph Smith deceased was unanimously chosen Pres. of the High Priesthood and of the Church of Jesus Christ of L.D.S. Reorganized."  '

    319, 147, 227 pages, plus later typed index leaves bound in. Approximately

    boards; moderate wear and foxing, a few early paper repairs, all pages
    numbered in manuscript; numerous early Adams family ownership markings and
    inscriptions, library markings including a few perforated stamps.
  FOOTNOTE: ' Abigail Smith “Abby” Adams (1806-1845) was the granddaughter of President John Adams. At least one source describes her as John Quincy Adams'' favorite niece, and describes his visits to her Medford, MA home after her 1831 marriage to John Angier (Eliza M. Gill, "Distinguished Guests and Residents of Medford," Medford Historical Register, January 1913, page 19). <BR><BR>The music in these volumes was almost entirely printed in the United States, and several pieces bear the inked stamps of Boston music sellers. One piece, "Araby''s Daughter," has a pencil note in an unknown hand: "Abby Adams Angier used to sing this." At least one piece appears to date from before Abby''s 1831 marriage: a Philadelphia printing of "When a Little Farm We Keep" is inscribed "A.S. Adams, Quincy." <BR><BR>One piece, Malibran''s "Le Rans de Vache," is inscribed warmly to Abby by her brother Isaac Hull Adams: "Dear Abby, you will find this delightful & if you can get Mr. Joseph to sing it, I am sure you will like it." Another piece is signed "I.H. Adams." Several pieces are initialed "TBA," presumably by Abby''s brother Thomas Boylston Adams Jr. (1809-1837) as their father died in 1832 before some of the signed pieces were published. <BR><BR>Two pieces, "Dark-Eyed One" and "The Mermaid''s Cave" are signed by their author, notable composer Charles E. Horn. An 1840 printing of "Six Irish Melodies" is signed by its composer James G. Maeder. <BR><BR>Among the more interesting pieces is a sort of proto-minstrel song, "Bonja Song, a Favorite Negro Air for the Piano-Forte," published in New York by J.A. & W. Geib. The London first printing circa 1800 is thought to be the first printed music to mention the banjo. <BR><BR>Provenance: gift from Samuel J. May of Dorchester, MA to historian Ernest Newton Bagg (1861-1937); donated by Bagg in 1913 to the City Library of Springfield, and later deaccessioned; Knotty Pine Antiques auction, circa 2008-2017.

  FOOTNOTE: ' Charles Emil Bendire (1836-1897) was a United States Army officer by trade, but an oologist by passion--a collector of bird''s eggs. His postings in the American West, though hazardous, allowed him to obtain many rare specimens. In one legendary incident, he was climbing a tree to take a zone-tailed hawk egg when an Apache scout opened fire on him. He placed the egg in his mouth for safe-keeping and rushed back to the fort. He later retired as a major, donated his collection to the Smithsonian Institution and served as curator of its egg collection, and he wrote the popular "Life Histories of North American Birds with Special Reference to Their Breeding Habits and Eggs." <BR><BR>Offered here are two letters which Bendire wrote to a fellow collector, Winfrid Alden Stearns (1852-1909), later the author of "New England Bird Life, being a Manual of New England Ornithology." The letters were written while stationed as a lieutenant with the 1st United States Cavalry near Tucson, AZ, the same year as his famous Apache incident. On 27 June 1872, he boasts of "quite a number of duplicate sets of eggs all collected on the Pacific coast. . . . My collection numbers over 5000 specimens. . . . Of Arizona eggs, I have quite a number which are very rare. . . . There are eggs among this lot that you must not expect to get unless you can outbid the Smithsonian." His 25 October 1872 letter is mainly concerned with packing and preservation advice.  '

    Approximately 170 manuscript letters and documents (0.2 linear feet) in one
    box; condition varies but generally strong.
  FOOTNOTE: ' The central figure in this archive is Thomas Noyes (1786-1860) of Painted Post, Chemung County, NY. His family suffered a terrible tragedy on 13 January 1840 with the sinking of the passenger steam Lexington on Long Island Sound. His son Charles Phelps Noyes (1818-1840) and brother-in-law Charles H. Phelps were aboard, on their way to visit family members in Stonington, CT. 7 letters in this lot dated January and February 1840 discuss the disaster. A New York cousin recalls: "I never saw dear Charles so reluctant to go to Stonington, yet his uncle thought it such a good excuse for him to make a visit." A black-bordered letter from friend Paul Babcock in New York City recalls: "Yr brother came here in the early part of last week & designed returning the latter part, but having slipped down on Thursday or Friday & sprained his ancle . . . stayed over till Monday the 13th." He then asked his nephew Charles Noyes to accompany him on the trip "as he was so much crippled." Babcock offers a long summary of the ship''s loss: a fire, "confusion & the swamping of 3 boats," the difficulty of a rescue with all nearby small vessels "being ice bound on the shores," and the rescue of a mere two crew members who clung to cotton bales in the icy waters overnight. <BR><BR>52 other letters are mostly dated 1834-1869. Son Henry B. Noyes wrote to his doomed brother Charles in 1836, asking "Let me know how they get along with the Stonington & Providence RR, when it will be completed." Charles responded with an 11 May 1838 letter discussing the safety of packet ships and English steamers, less than two year before his tragic death. A handful of 20th-century letters are addressed to Cornell University student Neil Morton and others (relation unknown). <BR><BR>Rounding out the collection are 37 documents (deeds, leases, etc.), 1801-1855; and 52 receipts dated 1784-1862, many of them relating to the family of Pardon and Achsah Redfield of Bainbridge, Chenango County, NY (relation to the Noyes family undetermined). Bainbridge was originally named Jericho, in Tioga County.<BR><BR>Among the more interesting odds and ends: a 16-page manuscript notebook of dessert recipes kept by the Noyes family; a worn fragmentary manuscript copy of the original division of the land in Jericho (Bainbridge), listing dozens of original settlers circa 1791; and a quite defective 1796 lease of Jericho land with a clear signature as witness by the town''s best-known founder, Jedediah Smith Sr. (father of the famous mountain man of the same name).

  FOOTNOTE: ' Howard Soule Jr. (1829-1924) was a prominent civil engineer based in Syracuse, NY; he began his career in 1854 with the Erie Canal. These two volumes document his estimates and proposals for bridge projects in at least 19 New York towns, most of them in the Syracuse / Oswego County area, but some as far-ranging at St. Lawrence County to the far north, Albany and Yonkers to the east, and Elmira and Binghamton to the south. Most projects contain sketches and a detailed estimate for supplies and labor. Often two or more design options for the same project are prepared. His designs included Whipple arch bridges, iron chord bridges, iron trapezoidal truss bridges, and one dubbed "Soule''s Combination Bridge" in Cohoes, NY. Almost all of the dated plans are from 1869 to 1874, with three added later in 1884 and 1885. <BR><BR>In addition to loose notes and sketches laid into the larger volume is an April 1869 letter to Soule from the Office American Sheet and Boiler Plate Co. of Cleveland, OH, quoting him the cost of iron beams. In the smaller volume, a clipping from Rochester, NY shows Soule''s bids in competition with 14 other engineering firms.

The firm was dissolved in 1873 after the death of partner William Black (1806-1873).<BR><BR>This tidy general ledger summarizes the firm''s profits and losses at the peak of their fame. A long note on page 59 discusses the expiration and renewal of their lease in 1858, followed by the sale of the remaining lease in 1860 when they moved to the new headquarters. Expense accounts on pages 114 to 115 give a hint of the store''s life, including total money spent on "Dog, alcohol, & chamois skins," "New Years presents and refreshments", "Cable celebration, Aug 1858" (for the transatlantic cable), and "6 red morocco chairs for store." The firm''s staff appear to be listed on pages 116-117. Individual customers are not listed except in a long section on "Bad Debts" from pages 146 to 162, several of them marked as dead. Five annual summaries of stock in hand are broken down into "silver ware," "diamond jewelry, "watches & movements," "cutlery," and other categories on pages 184-188.

Their lease of the land at 565 Broadway in 1859-1860, including their detailed commitment to erect a new building on the site, followed by the building expenses for the new store, are recorded on pages 260-275.<BR><BR>The bulk of the volume covers the 1855-1860 period. The Civil War occasionally intrudes into the later entries. The firm''s "Military Department" recorded a profit of $1187 in 1863 (page 301), and they presented $5000 to the United States Sanitary Fair in February 1864 (page 302). On 28 March 1865, weeks before the end of the fighting, Black pays "Orison Blunt for Substitute, U.S. Army, $1000"--presumably on behalf of a son (page 282). <BR><BR>The ledger appears to be written in one sitting in a precise secretarial hand, rather than by a team of clerks over the course of several years. Judging by the label on the front board, it may be a manuscript copy of the firm''s accounts made for the personal use of founding partner William Black. His own expenses are recorded in great detail (boots, newspaper subscriptions, purchases of individual pieces from the firm, even 31 cents for washing), while the accounts of partners Henry Ball and Ebenezer Monroe only summarize their dividends and profits. A balance in favor of Ball for $316,751.90 is recorded for March 1865--the firm was doing well. <BR><BR>A detailed inside look into what was once one of New York''s great luxury establishments.  '

If you like beer, and like to keep things simple, that''s probably all you need to know. <BR><BR>An ad in the 1853 New York directory shows James D. Traphagen at this 117 Warren Street address as one of two wholesalers for the Albany brewery of Eggleston & Mix. The New York Times of 9 December 1854 reported a fire at this address, where the lower two stories were occupied by "Mr. T. Traphagan, agent for Eccleston & Mise, manufacturers of Albany ale." Sadly, "a considerable amount of ale was lost." In the 1857 and 1859 New York directories, James D. Traphagen was reported as a dealer in ale and porter at another address. He was apparently the James Dickerson Traphagen (1825-1863) from Ulster County who lived with his parents in Manhattan through the 1850s. <BR><BR>The frame bears a worn but nearly complete label from G.B. Owen & Co., "Manufacturers and Dealers in Clocks, Looking-Glasses, Portrait and Picture Frames." George B. Owen was at the 325 Hudson Street address in Manhattan only from about 1854 to 1859, so this broadside was framed circa 1854.  '

    folio post binder, 11 x 17 inches, with some blueprints folding out to a
    larger size; minor wear, minor dampstaining toward end, a few items detached
    or with separations at folds.
  FOOTNOTE: ' Grand Central Station on 42nd Street in Manhattan remains one of the busiest and most elegant transit hubs in the world. It replaced another complex in the same location. Construction began in 1903, demolition of the old terminal began in 1910, and the present terminal was completed in 1913. This volume was compiled in 1917 using documents dating back to 1910, some of them incorporating data going back to 1900. The purpose was apparently to provide a comprehensive valuation of the company''s properties. It is divided into three sections: Land, Building, and Yard. Each section contains detailed tables of valuations of the terminal''s various properties, allocating them to "carrier" or "non-carrier." These are interspersed with plans and blueprints of various properties owned by the terminal''s participating railroads, some extending as far north as 56th Street. Several tables list the land acquisition costs and grantors for dozens of parcels acquired from 1900 to 1912, each keyed to a color-coded plan. The building reports name the Terminal''s tenants and the rent paid, and the terms of leases for major tenants. At the rear are 22 plans and blueprints of the Terminal properties, including a majestic side view of the main station buildings. <BR><BR>The volume contains a few cover letters, all of them retained carbon typescripts sent by assistant engineer Philip Hichborn Spear (1880-1960) to F.W. Stevens, the terminal''s General Valuation Counsel. The volume appears to be Spear''s retained copy of the detailed notes he submitted for an appraisal.

  FOOTNOTE: ' These drawings show the ornate woodwork for a Gilded Age Manhattan residence. Some are captioned with titles such as "butler''s pantry," "3rd story saloon," Ceilings, doorways, and hallways are shown. Some are signed by draftsman Lorenzo R. Hartung, a Manhattan cabinetmaker. The accompanying contract is dated 21 December 1889 between the builder Francis Crawford and the Freeman & O''Neill Company of Claremont, NH, who were by the first day of March to "prepare and deliver in the new building now being erected on south side of 72nd Street, all of the mantels for the basement, second story extension, and the entire third and fourth stories and all outside and inside blinds, agreeably to the drawings and specifications made by G.A. Schellinger, archt." <BR><BR>Francis Crawford (1840-1902) was a builder and developer whose offices were also on West 72nd Street. He built at least 4 houses on this block. 136 and 138 West 72nd, put up in 1883, are still standing and have landmark status. The New York Sun announced on 5 October 1891 that Crawford had sold two new buildings, 118 and 122 West 72nd Street, both of them 4-story brownstones, 25 by 60 feet, for the exorbitant sums of $78,000 and $80,000. The plans offered in this lot are quite possibly from one of these addresses.  '

He was at a studio at 62 Milk Street in Boston when reviewed by The Symbol (an Odd Fellows magazine) on 1 February 1844. A June 1846 flier held at Yale University places Nye in Plymouth, MA. An advertisement for selling his daguerrean apparatus ran in the Daily Chronotype of Boston from February 23 to 26, 1847. The 1850 census places him in Plymouth as a painter, and from 1855 until his death he was in Weymouth, MA, where he became a dentist.

  FOOTNOTE: ' This broadside was issued shortly before Connecticut''s 1804 state elections--for its representatives in Congress, and for the General Assembly''s Council of Assistants. Connecticut did not yet allow direct voting for president; its electors were chosen by the legislature. This state election, then, was the only influence Connecticut''s voters would have on the November presidential election. Founding Father Oliver Ellsworth, in a bid for his last political office, was on the slate for the Council. <BR><BR>Thomas Jefferson was seeking re-election to the presidency, and the Louisiana Purchase had given him great popularity, but Connecticut was an exception--they largely stayed true to the principles of Washington and Adams. With strict property requirements to vote, and a tradition of political leaders serving long terms with the backing of the state''s elite, Connecticut had recently earned the sarcastic nickname "The Land of Steady Habits," a term which the leaders embraced in this broadside: "They laughed at the steady habits of Connecticut: Yes, we cannot forget that this impious faction attempted to laugh us out of our steady habits, the pillars of our welfare here and hereafter!"<BR><BR>The broadside reflects an era before the formal institution of American political parties, but it contains a full dose of the partisan politics to come. It was issued by what we now call the Federalist Party. Although that term is nowhere to be seen here, a resolution by the "Federal Freemen of this State" is included. Vitriol is poured upon what we now call the Democratic-Republican Party, although for the most part they are here dismissed simply as "the faction." <BR><BR>The incumbent president Thomas Jefferson is mentioned only once by name, in a passage mocking the state''s Democratic-Republican politicians, who "ask you to vote for men who are in favor of Mr. Jefferson, or who are in favor of liberty of conscience, or universal suffrage, or for a new Constitution; it comes to the same request, and is in plain English, ''will you put me or us into office?''" Jefferson''s political appointees to local positions are also critiqued: "the Executive of the United States has thought it fit to select some of the most profligate of the Leaders of this Faction for offices of great trust and emolument among us and . . . has brought vice from its lurking places." The Federalist presidential candidate Charles Pinckney, whose support is being obliquely sought here, is not mentioned by name at all. <BR><BR>The Federalist slate took Connecticut in the September election, in both Litchfield County and the state as a whole. In the November presidential election, they gave the state''s 9 votes to Jefferson''s opponent Pinckney--which accounted for more than half of Pinckney''s total, as Jefferson won re-election in a landslide. <BR><BR>No other examples traced at auction, one other found in OCLC (Connecticut Historical Society).

    Printed invitation, 6¾ x 5¾ inches, completed in manuscript to invitee "Miss
    Livingston," plus integral blank leaf; horizontal mailing fold, minimal
    wear, tipped to mat. Framed with 3 photographs; not examined out of frame.
  FOOTNOTE: ' Eleanor Roosevelt''s 1905 wedding to fifth cousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt was widely reported in the society pages, as she was the favorite niece of sitting president Theodore Roosevelt. She had been orphaned at the age of 9 and raised in part by her grandmother Mary Livingston Ludlow Hall, who issued this wedding invitation: "Mrs. Valentine G. Hall requests the pleasure of Miss Livingston''s company at the wedding reception of her granddaughter Anna Eleanor Roosevelt and Mr. Franklin D. Roosevelt . . . at Eight East Seventy-sixth Street." President Roosevelt not only attended the wedding, but gave his niece away. <BR><BR>Provenance: collection of Donald Scott Carmichael (1912-2008), who authored "Franklin Roosevelt and Me: Brief Encounters in the Thirties," and was a leading collector of Roosevelt memorabilia.

    Large archive of photographs kept by Roosevelt and Truman's White House aide
    William Rigdon.
  at-a-glance: 'Various places, circa 1942-1953'
  TYPESET: >-
    More than 1000 photographs (1.3 linear feet) in one box and one folder,
    various sizes but most 8 x 10 inches; most moderately curled, but otherwise
    with generally minimal or minor wear.
  FOOTNOTE: ' William McKinley Rigdon (1904-1991) served in the Navy from 1923 to 1953. From 1942 to 1953, he was stationed in the White House as the naval aide to Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, reaching the rank of Commander. His duties extended far beyond naval matters; he was one of the Truman family''s closest aides, and was involved in travel planning. In 1964, he published the book "White House Sailor," recounting how he accompanied Roosevelt and Truman on dozens of trips as "secretary, mess officer, mailman, baggageman, banker, storekeeper, photographer, custodian of secret files, and keeper of official logs." <BR><BR>A large number of the photographs show Roosevelt and especially Truman at official events, often with national and international leaders. Just a small fraction of the highlights include Roosevelt meeting with Ethiopian leader Haile Selassie; Truman smiling with Joseph Stalin at the 1945 Potsdam conference; many shots of Winston Churchill, including one smoking a cigarette with a scowling Stalin and Roosevelt, another receiving an honorary degree with Roosevelt at McGill University, and two of Truman showing mounted photographs to a cigar-wielding Churchill as if at an auction exhibition; several of General Douglas MacArthur, one of them examining an enormous wall map with Roosevelt, and another with MacArthur, Roosevelt and Admiral Nimitz eating pineapples at a Hawaii luncheon; Roosevelt meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Eden in Quebec; and Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt seated with the Churchills. Some Navy press images unrelated to the presidents are also found, such as Senegalese laborers building an American air base at Dakar. <BR><BR>These photographs bear a variety of credits. Some are marked in the negative as work of the Army Signal Corps, and others are from the Navy Department. Others bear just an inked date stamp on verso, while many have no credits whatsoever. Some of the smaller snapshots come from the Bureau of Aeronautics at the Naval Air Station, while a few have substantial manuscript captions signed by Rigdon. Knowing that Rigdon served as an unofficial presidential photographer, it seems likely that many of the uncredited images were shot by him. <BR><BR>More than 700 of these photographs are standard 8 x 10-inch prints, generally unmounted except for 3 mounted on worn black scrapbook leaves. Also included are more than 300 smaller 4 x 5-inch prints, a few of them captioned in manuscript over Rigdon''s signature. Finally, the collection includes 21 larger prints, ranging up to 11 x 14 inches; some of these are duplicates of 8 x 10 images. 10 of the 8 x 10 prints are glossy color prints, most apparently taken at Truman''s Key West retreat. Truman is shown posing in bathing trunks in two of these shots. <BR><BR>Rigdon retired from the navy in August 1953, and then attended Cornell University''s school of hotel administration for a year. These photographs were found in a house purchased near Cornell University in 2009.  '

  CROSSHEAD: Pair of yearbooks from the Choate School featuring student John F. Kennedy.
  at-a-glance: 'Wallingford, CT, 1934 and 1935'
  TYPESET: >-
    Heavily illustrated. 295, 45; 292, 48 pages. Volumes XXXV and XXXVI of "The
    Brief." 4to, full morocco gilt, first volume worn with tape repair, second
    volume tastefully rebacked and restored with original endpapers retained; a
    bit musty, minor dampstaining and edge wear to endpapers in second volume;
    signed on endpapers by a classmate.
  FOOTNOTE: ' The 1934 yearbook from Kennedy''s junior year gives his name on pages 113 and 286, and he probably appears somewhere in the class picture on page 114. He is also listed as an associate editor of the yearbook on page 119, and appears in the yearbook staff''s group shot on the facing page. Kennedy''s brother Joseph Jr., who had graduated from Choate in 1933, is mentioned for winning a Harvard football trophy on page 257. <BR><BR>The 1935 yearbook features Kennedy''s senior portrait on page 76. It gives his nicknames as "Jack" and "Ken", lists his participation in several sports and as general manager of the yearbook, and notes Harvard as his next destination. In the "Class Votes" on page 107, Kennedy was not listed as "Most Respected" or "Most Influential" or "Best Looking"--but he won "Most Likely to Succeed" by a landslide. He also appears on pages 116 and 117 featuring the yearbook staff, including a group photograph where he is seated in the front row. His name appears on pages 49 and 283, and he may be in the class group portrait on page 50. Kennedy''s roommate and lifelong friend Kirk "Lem" Billings appears on page 52 (and voted "best natured" and "quietest" on page 107). A candid shot of Billings and Kennedy playing in a snowdrift on page 268 is titled "Leem" and "Rat Face"--a nickname Kennedy was apparently comfortable with, as he served on the yearbook staff. <BR><BR>Also shown in both volumes is headmaster George St. John, who is said to have delivered sermons to the students urging them to ask "not what Choate does for you, but what you can do for Choate." This may have influenced Kennedy''s most famous bit of oratory in 1961: "Ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country."  '

  FOOTNOTE: ' This date first came into the public consciousness on 18 December 2020, when President Trump announced "Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!" On 1 January 2021, Women for America First obtained a permit for a rally with an estimated attendance of 5,000 on First Amendment (free speech) grounds. <BR><BR>In preparation for the rally, these parking notices were affixed to utility poles in the rally area. This example was posted on 7th Street where it meets the north end of the National Mall, about halfway between the Washington Monument and the Capitol building. It restricts parking along several blocks of 7th Street "from Independence Avenue SW to E Street NW." The reason for the restriction is given as "First Amendment Activity." <BR><BR>On 6 January 2021, at about noon, President Trump gave a speech on the Ellipse, assuring his supporters that he would never concede the election, and urging them: "We fight. We fight like Hell and if you don''t fight like Hell, you''re not going to have a country anymore." They then marched east along the Mall, passing this sign, to the Capitol building where the certification of the Electoral College results was taking place. Exactly what happened next is still a matter of public and legal debate. <BR><BR>Approximately 4 days after the attack, our consignor salvaged this rain-dampened sign.  '

    Large and wide-ranging collection of tickets, broadsides and ephemera from
    Rhode Island lotteries.
  at-a-glance: 'Various places, 1752-1844'
  TYPESET: '137 items, all neatly sleeved; condition generally strong.'
  FOOTNOTE: ' Rhode Island was the lottery capital of early America despite its small size, authorizing almost half of the lotteries which took place among the 13 colonies, and almost 250 lotteries through 1842, when the launch of new lotteries was banned by the state constitution. Lotteries were granted for various charitable purposes, and greatly aided the development of Rhode Island''s infrastructure, churches, and schools in lieu of taxes. By 1800, the grantees would often contract out the work of running the lottery to a specialized management firm which printed tickets, placed advertisements, and distributed prizes. This collection includes: <BR><BR>77 lottery tickets from across Rhode Island, 1752-1842. Each is signed by a manager, gives a ticket number in manuscript, and states the beneficiary or authorizing act; some have the purchaser''s signature on verso. The earliest is for the 1752 Newport Street Lottery. 10 others are from the colonial period, including Providence street and meeting house lotteries, the "Furnace-Unity Bridge Lottery," "Glocester Road Lottery," "King Street Lottery," and "Pawtuxet Baptist Parsonage Lottery." One ticket for "disposing of the Real Estate of George H. Peckham" was authorized during the Revolution, in 1782. 3 uncut sheets of two or more tickets are included. Later tickets benefitted the Providence Episcopal Church (1785), the Providence Great Bridge (1790), Pier Wharf in South Kingstown (1791), the Cumberland Meeting House (1795), Smithfield and Cumberland Bridge (1795), Beneficent Congregational Meeting House (1796), Rhode Island College a.k.a. Brown University (1797), Barrington Meeting House (1798), Bristol Church (1801), Washington & Coventry Meeting House (1808), Providence and Worcester Road (1825), Washington Canal (1826), Washington Lodge for construction of a Masonic Hall in Wickford (1826), Buck Hill Road (1826), Blackstone River Bridge (1826), the Rhode Island School Fund, and many more. Some are signed by leading merchants such as Samuel Nightingale Jr. <BR><BR>3 tickets from the November 1776 United States Lottery issued by the Continental Congress, each signed by an official Continental lottery manager (either John Purviance or Sharp Delany). One is signed on verso by two co-owners. <BR><BR>7 receipts issued for the purchase of lottery tickets, 1804-1823, including the Scituate & Foster Academy and the Greene Academy.<BR><BR>18 miscellaneous lottery-related documents, including two legal writ issued against men who failed to pay for tickets in 1818 and 1823; 3 slips recording the official numbers drawn for lotteries in 1839; a formal application to act as a lottery broker, 1836; a list of licensed lottery dealers from 1841; 3 out-of-state tickets; and 4 documents from an 1835 trial of a man selling Rhode Island lottery tickets in New York. <BR><BR>32 broadside lottery advertisements, 1825-1844. Most of these state the total distribution of prizes, the managers, the date and place when winning tickets will be drawn, and the designated charity--at this late date, almost always for the benefit or encouragement of public schools. This may remind modern Providence readers of "Mayor''s Own Marinara Sauce," which for decades now has promised that it is "benefiting Providence school children." One unusual broadside is for an 1839 Maryland lottery promoted in Providence, promising "Great Luck at Jones'' Office," with prizes to be distributed at the "Truly Fortunate Office." Sizes range from 7 to 17½ inches in height, with surprising variety in graphic design. Bibliography: Bartlett, "History of Lotteries and the Lottery System in Rhode Island," edited by Russell J.

  CROSSHEAD: Large collection of billheads from Rhode Island and beyond.
  at-a-glance: 'Various places, 1752-1975, bulk 1850-1910'
  TYPESET: >-
    Approximately 1300 items, neatly sleeved in 9 binders (2.3 linear feet);
    condition generally strong.
  FOOTNOTE: ' A substantial and absorbing collection of ephemera. Just about any kind of mid or large-sized business involved in invoicing customers might have its own printed billheads. Represented here are everything from cracker bakers to silversmiths to toy stores to hotels. Many are illustrated, ranging from generic woodcuts to expertly rendered views of storefronts and factory complexes. Interspersed with the billheads are a few examples of illustrated letterheads used for correspondence. The great bulk of the billheads have been used for invoicing a wide variety of customers, allowing us to get a taste of the products offered. Many are marked as paid, either in manuscript or with an inked stamp, and many were docketed on verso. Several billheads from printers and stationers are included; if you want to get "meta," there is even an 1898 billhead from Worcester, MA for printing letterheads. <BR><BR>Billheads from Providence, RI comprise approximately half of the collection, arranged alphabetically by business name. 2 binders with approximately 250 billheads cover the remainder of Rhode Island, arranged by town. 3 binders with approximately 400 items extend beyond Rhode Island. Arranged by state, the bulk are from Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York. A bill from the Danvers Lunatic Asylum in Massachusetts bills an inmate''s guardians for 24 days'' board plus mortuary expenses in 1891. <BR><BR>The glory days of commercial billheads were from about 1850 to 1910, but a handful of examples are included outside those bounds, with the earliest being a manuscript bill for pickle pots and jugs issued by a Newport merchant in 1752, and the earliest printed example being a 1794 invoice from Philadelphia haberdasher William Holdernesse. The latest is an illustrated 1975 letterhead from fine pen maker A.T. Cross Company. The bulk seem to be from the Yankee establishment which made up New England''s middle and upper classes, but a few represent the immigrants who came in the late 19th century, such as 7 different examples from the wholesale grocers of the Ventrone family who catered to Providence''s Italian community, 1897-1916; and funeral director Arsene Therien, "entrepreneur de pompes funèbres" in French-Canadian Woonsocket. <BR><BR>Much of this collection was exhibited at the University of Rhode Island in November 2001. Included with the lot is the exhibition catalog by Russell J. DeSimone, "A Survey of 19th Century Rhode Island Billheads" (#50 of 250). Provenance: collection of Russell J. DeSimone.  '

  FOOTNOTE: ' The First Light Infantry Company was an independent unit in the Rhode Island militia. Based in Providence, it saw occasional duty during times of crisis such as the Dorr Rebellion, but mostly seemed to function as a social club. This register was apparently kept at their well-stocked headquarters over a four-year period, including almost daily entries from February to July 1851. Each night, the members signed in and filled the margins with silly inside jokes, the meanings now lost to time. <BR><BR>"T.S. Browne, Harts are trumps, Sober Capt." <BR><BR>"Henry Staples, gone out to take a drink." <BR><BR>"Francis J.

Punk!" <BR><BR>We do not fully understand most of these notes in 2022. We suspect the members themselves did not understand them as soon as the next morning. The daily roll calls of intoxicated militiamen are interspersed with occasional longer notes regarding actual militia business, and guest lists of more formal "hops" where wives and sweethearts were invited to attend. A rare slice of life from the front lines of the bar. You can almost smell the booze wafting off the pages.  '

  TYPESET: >-
    23 manuscript pages and 2 engravings. 4to, original gilt morocco with cable
    cross-section laid in, moderate wear, rebacked; one leaf detached, otherwise

  FOOTNOTE: ' Cyrus Field''s first functioning transatlantic cable began transmitting messages in August 1858, and failed the following month. Almost immediately, fragments were cut up into souvenirs. The present album was first advertised in the New York Times on 9 October 1858 by its promoter Eugene Ely. <BR><BR>It is a standard commonplace book or friendship album of the period, with the addition of a 5/8-inch cross-section of the cable mounted in the middle of its front board, surrounded by the words "Atlantic Cable Album" and "Charm." The front board is considerably thicker than the rear to accommodate the cross-section. Ely''s copyright notice, gilt-printed on black glossy stock, is mounted to the inner wrapper: "This Specimen of the Atlantic Cable guaranteed to be genuine by the Publisher." <BR><BR>The album was then used as a typical commonplace book of the era. It was presented in 1859 to William B. Hoyt of Ashtabula, OH for his work as superintendent of a Methodist Sunday school. Two religious engravings are bound in, in addition to 23 pages of manuscript inscriptions to Hoyt, 1859 and undated. No other examples of the Atlantic Cable Album have been traced at auction.  '

Most of these letters are from suppliers, contractors, customers, and journalists in the boating world, many relating to his Viper series of boats. Correspondents include E.W. Johnston, editor of Canadian Motor Boat; the Ferro Machine & Foundry Company of Cleveland, OH; and Walter M. Billing, editor of The Rudder in New York, who illustrated one letter with a drawing of an 1877 riverboat (illustrated). Hickman boasts about his boat''s performance at a Canada-wide exhibition in an 18 October 1910 letter to his engine supplier: "It was not a race, any more than any Viper race ever has been. It was a feverish holocaust. . . . Boat for boat, we licked her by 2 min. 7 sec., and the Essex by nearly 5 minutes. There is not a motor boat man in Eastern Canada who doesn''t know what engine is in Viper."  '

  CROSSHEAD: Patent exploitation license for an early American washing machine.
  at-a-glance: 'Rowley, MA, 18 March 1800'
  TYPESET: >-
    Party printed document, signed twice by Elias Weld and witnesses. 2 pages,
    12 x 7 inches, on one folding sheet; minor wear at intersection of folds,
    minor foxing.
  FOOTNOTE: ' The first American patent was issued in 1790, and the number issued in following years was modest. Patent holders would attempt to capitalize by licensing their new discoveries to manufacturers across the country. The first American patent for a washing machine was issued to Nathaniel Briggs in 1797. Less is known about the second washing machine patent, issued to Ezra Weld of Braintree, MA on 26 June 1799. The original patent papers have long since been lost to fire. However, Weld had contract forms printed to set forth the terms of his standard agreement. <BR><BR>Offered here is one of Weld''s license agreements for "the exclusive right and liberty of making, using, and vending to others to be used, his new and useful improvement, called Lavater and Wringer, for the washing and wringing of clothes." The license was granted by Weld''s son Elias Weld (1772-1863) to Captain James Chute of Rowley, MA for a period of 14 years "in the towns of Rowley, Ipswich, Gloucester, Hambleton [Hamilton], Manchester, Wenham, and the parish of Byfield"--a large portion of Essex County north of Salem. For these rights, Chute paid a fee of $214 on 18 March 1800. A duplicate printing of the same form appears on the second integral leaf, featuring nearly identical license to Captain Chute--this time signed in Elias''s hometown of Amesbury, MA, with a date of 4 June 1801 and a fee of $300. <BR><BR>The Rev. Ezra Weld (1736-1816) served for almost 50 years as a Congregational minister in Braintree, MA, but very little is known about his side work as a washing machine inventor--it is not mentioned in his lengthy profile in Yale''s "Biographical Sketches." However, the invention seems to have found at least modest success. Weld''s fellow minister Timothy Alden, in an 1801 sermon titled "The Glory of America. A Century Sermon,'' mentioned in passing that Weld''s washing machine was "a great improvement upon all other machines of the kind, and is coming into general use in many parts of the country." In the early federal period, when such a list was still feasible, his invention sometimes shows up in a list of all American patents, such as in the May 1806 issue of the Medical Repository, page 111-2. Weld was licensing the patent at least through 28 April 1804, when one of his other assignees ran an advertisement in a Rutland, VT newspaper: "To save labor and that of females, cannot here be unimportant. To spare the toils of the wife must be an object with any husband." <BR><BR>No other examples of this licensing agreement have been traced; it sheds new light on an obscure but significant early American invention.

  FOOTNOTE: ' Porter''s Spirit of the Times was a general sporting and theatrical weekly, but is best remembered today for its role in recording a critical period during baseball''s amateur era. The National Association of Base Ball Players was the first baseball organization to extend beyond a single club, and its birth coincides neatly with the first volume of Porter''s. The first hint comes in Volume 1, issue No. 6 (11 October 1856): "It is said that a Convention of all the Base Ball Clubs of this city and suburbs will be held this fall, for the purpose of considering whether any and what amendments to the rules and laws governing this game should be made." A baseball column on 6 December 1856 includes the complete rules of the dominant New York variant of the game, including a diagram of the field, plus a player-by-player review of the pioneering Knickerbocker club. The beleaguered Massachusetts variant is discussed and diagrammed on 27 December 1856. The first baseball convention was reported at length on 31 January 1857, with a patriotic flourish: "Base Ball . . . ought to be looked upon in this country with the same national enthusiasm as Cricket and Foot Ball are regarded in the British Islands. . . . There should be some one game peculiar to the citizens of the United States." This organization can be considered the birth of organized league baseball in America. <BR><BR>Perhaps the high point of the baseball coverage is the 12 September 1857 issue, which features "the earliest illustration of adults playing a baseball match" (Block, page 226). The Eagles and Gothams of New York are shown playing at Hoboken''s Elysian Fields. Early stars Jim Creighton of the Niagara club and Harry Wright of the Knickerbockers can often be seen in the box scores by July 1858. <BR><BR>"An important repository of early baseball, including . . . the publication of the first set of rules"--Lomazow 639 and BB1. "In this, the first early heyday of the game, Porter''s set such a high standard for baseball coverage that even the legendary Clipper could not, at first, keep up"--Block, Baseball Before We Knew It, page 226.

    Diary of a trip through western Virginia by horse, and then to Niagara Falls

  TYPESET: >-
    [64, 76] manuscript pages. 12mo, original stiff calf wrappers, minor wear,
    titled in manuscript "Virginia 1842, Niagara 1843"; minimal wear to
    contents.
  FOOTNOTE: ' This volume is an entertaining recounting of two unusual trips by a young Baltimore man. In the summer of 1842, he undertakes a journey by horseback to see Virginia''s leading tourist attractions, including Mount Vernon. The next year he attempts to walk from Baltimore to Niagara Falls with two friends, although they complete the journey by boat and rail. This young adventurer''s identity has not yet been puzzled out. As the entries are in a tidy and consistent hand with few corrections, we suspect it was a clean copy written out shortly after his arrival home. <BR><BR>The first trip extends from 8 August to 6 September. His itinerary includes the home of Charles Carroll in Carrollton, MD; Harpers Ferry, WV; and then into Virginia: Staunton, Natural Bridge, Warm Springs, his furthest southwest point at Cloverdale near Roanoke, Charlottesville, and back home through Washington. On 20 August he visits Weyer''s Cave (now Grand Caverns), the nation''s oldest show cave, opened to tourists in 1806, and here described at length. His guide shares "a host of tales & stories of witches & fairies & robbers." He also hits the trifecta of Founding Father homesteads, none of them yet properly set up for tourists. Monticello was "now in the possession of Capt. Levy of the Navy who has just been court-martialed. He is said to be very rude to strangers. He was not at home. A servant showed me in." Jefferson''s gravestone had been removed to the house to protect it from vandals. At James Madison''s late home Montpelier, "J Payne Todd resides here at present, Mrs. Madison his mother being in Washington. He is very polished & polite, invited me to dinner which I accepted. He is here all alone in his glory, having no more ribs than the number he was born with." John Payne Todd, President Madison''s stepson, was a wastrel bachelor whose debts forced the sale of Montpelier just two years later, in 1844. <BR><BR>Most notably, our diarist describes his visit to Mount Vernon at length: "The gate was opened by an old woman, one of Washington''s servants, who said she remembered him perfectly well. After arriving at the house, I went to the tomb. It has recently been built & the body of the general is in a sarcophagus & that of his wife in another. The whole affair is very neat but might have been much better. I then went to the old vault which has gone to ruin. The doors are broken down & the stones at the opening have fallen away. . . . The house stands on an eminence. It is two stories high & has a piazza reaching to the top in front. At back are the two gardens, one for vegetables and the other for flowers. The latter I walked through. It was kept by an old negro who, if you manage right, is as clever as the day is long. The negro houses are better here than any I have seen in Virginia." <BR><BR>The second journey has less star power, but is more unusual. Our adventurer sets out on 17 July 1843 on a "pedestrian tour": a backpacking expedition with a friend named Herman Wigman, about 120 years before fashion and modern hiking gear made such excursions more popular. Their goal was to walk from Baltimore to Niagara Falls, which today would be a good long day''s drive, but in 1843 with no horses and no modern roads was quite an undertaking. In the first entry, he notes that "our knapsacks although containing only the necessarys of the journy we found ere we had proceded many yards very heavy & wearying to our backs." They nonetheless crossed into Pennsylvania the second day, and soon joined a third friend on leave from the Navy. They were often able to load their sacks onto canal boats and follow along on the towpaths. They met many inspiring or eccentric local characters on the route, including a canal boat operator who was in competition with former circus performers, and near Danville, PA they went to the top of a cliff where "a man of eccentric habits has built some houses, one leaning over the cliff of 400 feet in height. Here he is said to keep his library." In Wilkes Barre he describes at length an author calling himself the "Lunatic Bard of Wyoming" (Anthony Brower) who gave them an autographed book and invited them for dinner: "His room was adorned with ends & scraps picked up everywhere, papers, pictures, feathers, calico &c, hung all around the wall." They are delayed by bad weather and illness near the New York border, and then go the rest of the way to Niagara by rail and canal boat. He describes many of the sights near the falls (already a well-developed tourist site), including the Tuscarora reservation: "These Indians for the most part live in huts miserably constructed of logs. . . . The squaws dress in a peculiar manner. They have a mantle which nearly covers the head & is masst about the body & then hangs down behind in a peak nearly reaching the ground." <BR><BR>The three young men split up on the way home from Niagara, with our diarist venturing on to Newport, RI to meet his vacationing father. On a steamboat he saw "a soldier company returning home from an encampment at Newport. They were the remnants of the patriots of Dorr''s Rebellion. T''wod have been fun to see them make a charge on a regular set of soldiers." He arrived back in Baltimore on 6 September. Additional notes on this thoroughly entertaining journal are available upon request.  '

  FOOTNOTE: ' The author Frederick Heath Bowman Jr. (1910-1993) was generally known as Heath Bowman. Born in Indiana, his family later moved to Evanston, IL, and he graduated from Princeton University in 1931. There he met woodcut illustrator Stirling Dickinson, and they spent six months together touring Mexico in 1934. Dickinson co-wrote and illustrated three books with Bowman on Latin America: "Mexican Odyssey" (1935), "Westward from Rio" (1936), and "Death is Incidental, a Story of Revolution" (1937). Dickinson remained to lead the American expat artist colony in San Miguel de Allende, where he was visited by Kerouac and other Beat Generation writers. Bowman returned to the United States. With his wife Jefferson he wrote "Crusoe''s Island in the Caribbean" (1939), a history and travelogue on the island of Tobago. He published an historical novel called "All Your Born Days" (1939), and his final book was on his state of birth, "Hoosier: A Composite Portrait" (1941). In later years, Bowman was an international cultural affairs officer for the federal government, and spent his final years in Rome. <BR><BR>From Bowman''s Mexican period, this lot includes: 51 small woodcut prints in various sizes and formats on Latin American themes, some or all by Stirling Dickinson; 16 colorful Mexican broadsides for movie theaters, the lottery and other subjects; Bowman''s 1937 membership certificate in the Sociedad Amigos de San Miguel de Allende; his manuscript list of Mexican books on the verso of another author''s book flier; 3 posters for "Mexican Odyssey" and "Westward from Rio" featuring Dickinson''s artwork; and a 6-page typescript titled "Padre Francisco Hernandez''s Story," possibly from "Death is Incidental." <BR><BR>This lot also contains material from several of Bowman''s other projects--approximately 150 leaves of typescript and manuscript notes and drafts on Tobago and Indiana.

    Letter about an arms inspection for Eli Whitney--with the earliest known
    reference to Uncle Sam.
  at-a-glance: 'Springfield, MA, 7 June 1803'
  TYPESET: >-
    Autograph Letter Signed to his son Hector Orr. One page, 12½ x 7½ inches,
    with docketing and address panel on verso but no postal markings; full
    separation at bottom fold, toned, minor dampstaining at bottom.
  FOOTNOTE: ' Robert Orr (1745-1811) was a master armorer in Springfield, MA who was contracted to inspect the weapons produced at Eli Whitney''s armory in New Haven, CT. At the close of a chatty letter to his son, he remarks "I expect to go to New Haven next week to inspect armes made by Ely Whitney for Unkel Sam 500." <BR><BR>The earliest previously known references to Uncle Sam as a slang personification of the United States was in 1810. The phrase became more generally known in the 1830s, and did not assume its full modern iconic status until the famous World War One recruitment posters by James Montgomery Flagg. The term essentially replaced earlier terms such as Columbia, Lady Liberty, and Brother Jonathan. A popular theory traces the origin to a military meat supplier named Sam Wilson in Troy, NY in the War of 1812. This myth was undermined by the recent discovery of the term in a 24 March 1810 diary entry by a navy midshipman named Isaac Mayo, who referred to himself as being in the service of Uncle Sam. <BR><BR>Robert Orr''s letter pushes the timeline back an additional seven years. His casual use of the term with his son suggests it was in common use among military contractors by 1803, and that he had used it in family conversations before. Or maybe he invented it right there on the spot--the meaning is easily gleaned in context. Uncle Sam=U.S.=United States. The phrase has stuck around so long for a reason. <BR><BR>Even setting Uncle Sam aside, this is an interesting letter because of its connection to Eli Whitney''s armory. Whitney signed a contract in 1798 to produce rifles for the United States Army, and set up a water-powered factory creating interchangeable parts just north of New Haven, CT--the first of its kind in the United States. The factory was slow to produce any results, and was met with some skepticism about whether the parts really were interchangeable. It made its first deliveries of 500 muskets each in September 1801 and June 1802 before bringing in Robert Orr to inspect further shipments. Orr''s career is well documented in history. He was the master armorer at Springfield Armory from 1795 to 1802, inspected batches of 500 rifles for Whitney in September 1802 and March 1803, and continued in that work until replaced by another inspector in 1809. See Moller, "American Military Shoulder Arms," Volume II, pages 156-160. Whitney rifles with his "US--ORR" inspection stamp are still found in collections; Morphy Auctions sold one in 2010. <BR><BR>The main body of the letter is full of family news, all of which matches the known Orr family genealogy and local news events. He writes to his eldest son Hector Orr (1770-1855), a physician in Bridgewater, MA who was then serving as adjutant in the state militia. Orr makes it very clear that Eli Whitney''s federally contracted rifles were being produced for Uncle Sam. There''s no doubt he means the United States government, and not an uncle who was a weapons mogul. Just in case you are wondering, though, as far as we can determine, the Orrs did not have an actual uncle named Sam. Neither Robert Orr, his wife, or any of their four parents had a brother named Samuel.  '

His health is much better than when I saw him last." <BR><BR>John Randolph then adds a two-page postscript in his own hand: "Do me the favour to tell Mr. Charles Ellis that your father has been so kind as to undertake to select some of his articles (imported in the Equator) for me when he gets to Richmond. I have left Mr. Ellis''s advertisement at home but I will enumerate a few that he will be so good as to keep for me." He then adds a long narrative list of mercantile goods, such as "ready made great coats for myself & servants. . . . Gaiters, but 3 of the gaiters to be black for servants. . . Grass, bramble & grain scythes. . . . Two hall door brass locks, large size, one dozen ditto for dining, drawing room & bed chamber doors, as many for closets & dressing rooms.

  CROSSHEAD: Manuscript account of the Battle of the Châteauguay and more.
  at-a-glance: 'No place, circa 1815'
  TYPESET: >-
    4 manuscript pages (numbered 9-12), 12¼ x 7 inches, on 2 leaves; folds, worn
    with occasional fading and text loss but generally legible, lacking the
    first 8 pages and the conclusion.
  FOOTNOTE: ' This fragmentary manuscript account offers a fresh participant''s perspective on the failed effort to capture Montreal in the St. Lawrence Campaign, as well as the subsequent defense of Plattsburgh. It is written with passion and flair. <BR><BR>Two American forces headed north to attack the city from different directions. Our anonymous author was an officer serving under Major General Wade Hampton, heading north from Plattsburgh, NY. Reaching a British fort on the banks of the River Châteauguay, Hampton split his forces into two divisions to flank the defenders, but both divisions were crushed and forced to retreat in the 26 October 1813 Battle of the Châteauguay. <BR><BR>Setting the stage for the battle, our narrator notes that the British Lieutenant General Sir George Prévost recognized the threat to Montreal, so he "himself here commanded, for he well knew that [upon] the successful defence of this village, the safety of his rich & beautiful city depended." Hampton''s Second Division, with the element of surprise, began well: the British "could not resist the impetuosity of the brave reg’ts in the attack & his left gave way & retrieted thro the pass. His right fearing its annihilation retreated also in great disorder, leaving many killed wounded and prisoners." Then Hampton looked for the expected flanking aid from the First Division under Colonel Purdy. The standard battle account has the Purdy''s division becoming lost in an exhausting muddy night march. This narrative paints Purdy in a less flattering light. At the crucial moment in the battle, "If Col. Purdy had obeyed his orders such a victory would that day have been atchieved. . . . On the opposite side of the river! it was now with extreme mortification that we observed Col. Purdy, in direct violation of the orders he had rec’d, had not advanced within twenty-four hours than the 2nd Division had in twelve. He had permitted his men to sit down (just before we attacked the enemy) and eat their dinners! When we began the attack, we perceived them emerging from the woods, some without arms, to be spectators of the scene!" Both divisions were soon routed, and marched south in a humiliating retreat, their dreams of Montreal crushed: "The army sufferd much on this march, having no tents were obliged to lay down on the snow. Many a poor soldier met their death in consequence of such severe marches." Our narrator, in addition to his denunciation of Colonel Purdy, also notes the well-known hostility between the two American Major Generals who were supposed to be working jointly toward Montreal: "Had Hampton laying aside folly & pride joined Wilkinson and proceeded against Montreal, cooperating with each other and furthering all in their power the public service with such a respectable army as they might have had, nothing could have opposed them. Quebec would have fallen. . . . Such an army and obliged to fly from Canada! Great God! To retreat with disgrace! And all owing to the damned feuds of its commanders! "<BR><BR>The narrative continues with the arrival in Plattsburgh, where Wilkinson soon took charge of the army. His abortive final assault on Montreal and its termination in the 30 March 1814 Battle of Lacolle Mills are briefly noted. Finally, the events leading up to the September 1814 Battle of Plattsburgh are described in detail. Here the tone is quite different, with the British assembling a mighty and haughty invasion force which would be stopped by a small and scrappy group of American defenders: "The enemy had just rec’d reinforcements of Invincible troops together with a new supply of his most scientific gen’ls from Wellingtons army in Spain & France who had recently conquered Napoleon! With such an army he thought to make Yankees flee like sheep before him, nor stop untill he had sniffed the waters of the Atlantic! He thought we should make turkey tracks here quick on his advance towards us with 14,000 Invincibles. But the result to us, how glorious, to him how unfortunate!" It concludes with General Prevost''s over-confident plans to install military governors throughout New York and New England: "Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia & N. York cities were to fall, and with them the Nation!”  '

  FOOTNOTE: ' "I find that the Indian massacres have been greatly exaggerated . . . most of the Indians have concentrated in the north" <BR><BR>This letter was written by an officer in General Crook''s command just weeks before the Battles of the Rosebud and Little Bighorn. Walter Scribner Schuyler (1850-1932), a future Army general, was at this time a second lieutenant in the 5th Cavalry, and was en route from Kansas to serve as an aide to General George Crook, trying to catch up with the main army. Three large columns of cavalry were converging for a long-planned offensive against the Sioux in south-central Montana. Crook''s column set out from Fort Fetterman to the south. Twenty days later, a detachment from Terry''s column led by Colonel Custer would find defeat at the Battle of the Little Bighorn--a disaster which of course Schuyler could not see coming when he wrote this breezy letter to his sister: <BR><BR>“I arrived here . . . in good order except as to my face, which was badly chapped by the wind. The stage makes the ninety-odd miles in about 12 hours, there being five changes of horses on the route. I find that I shall have to wait here for some days, until a wagon train goes to Fetterman, as I cannot travel thence without escort. At that point I shall have to wait until about the 20th instant, when Gen’l C. is expected to send in a wagon train for supplies. I dislike the waiting, as I am of no use to anyone, and fear that I may miss all the fighting. Nearly all of my regiment has been ordered here from Kansas to reinforce Crook, a very welcome addition to our force. I meet many friends here, whom I used to know at Russell. I am the guest of Lieut. [William Wallace] Rogers, 9th Inf''ty whose company has but recently come in from the Black Hills. I find that the Indian massacres have been greatly exaggerated to me, and for the present there is but little danger in this section as most of the Indians have concentrated in the north, at the mouth of the Powder River on the Little Missouri. If I do nothing else, I shall have a chance to see the country. I hope that some fortunate chance may take us into the famous Yellowstone Park.” <BR><BR>Schuyler had no way of knowing, but Crook''s column had already departed from Fort Fetterman, MT on 29 May toward the Sioux encampment. He was correct about the relative safety of his present location in Wyoming, but a bit off base about the real danger--the mouth of the Powder River was more than 150 miles from the Battle of the Rosebud where Crook''s column would be engaged on 17 June, and from the Little Bighorn site where Custer would be wiped out on 24 June. One thing we can be sure of: in the coming weeks, Lt. Schuyler had no time for a side trip to Yellowstone Park.  '

  FOOTNOTE: ' This notebook traces the extensive land holdings of Morris and Pheobus Freudenthal in the Refugio Grant, located near Anthony, NM just north of El Paso, TX. The cover and title page state that these are field notes made for the Freudenthals by United States Deputy Surveyors Garrett, Nichols & Woodson in 1888. The notes trace dozens of tracts, describing not only property lines but other distinguishing features: "Enter thick growth of willows," "Some of this land is low and grown up with a coarse cane-like grass." The Freudenthals made extensive additional notes in the volume in various hands, tracing land sales through at least 1901, often in impressionistic notes, such as "Olguin took Juan Garcia land" near the end of the volume.

  FOOTNOTE: ' In 1910, United Brethren missionaries founded a mission school in remote Velarde, NM, between Santa Fé and Taos. An additional campus was launched in 1915, several miles down river in the town of Santa Cruz, NM, which became known as the McCurdy Mission School. These photographs depict the buildings, staff, and students at both schools. They were apparently collected by Mary Esther Brawner (1893-1977), an Illinois native who taught at the Velarde school as a missionary from 1916 to 1925. The large-format photographs bear several generations of captions, but the captions written in blue ink match Brawner''s period of service, and beneath some of them a later owner has written "Miss Bronner." <BR><BR>The school was the subject of Robert H. Terry''s 1984 book "Light in the Valley: The McCurdy Mission Story" (copy included with the lot), which discussed Miss Brawner at length.

  FOOTNOTE: ' This letterbook was kept by George A. Eastman as agent and treasurer for two South Dakota real estate firms: Vermont Investment Company (with holdings in Rapid City and elsewhere) and the Catholicon Hot Springs Company (building a spa resort in Fall River County in the southwestern corner of the state). <BR><BR>Eastman writes to a Boston investor on 14 December 1892: "I have no doubt in my mind that we can gather in a barrel of shekels in this deal without risk, as we have passed the point where the future of the Springs can be questioned." One page 118 is a blank loan application to be made out for potential Catholicon investors. On page 161 is a transcribed testimonial letter from a "happy customer" who had taken his wife to the springs with "a very bad case of rheumatism, and today I take her home cured of her rheumatism and her general health better than for many months as a result of bathing in your Catholicon Waters." <BR><BR>Eastman''s letters to his firm''s president L.F. Englesby of Burlington, VT are considerably harder-edged than his letters to potential investors. A 7 March 1893 letter cautions Englesby that without bonds, the project may be seen as "a Western scheme to raise money, which scheme would have to be thoroughly investigated, whereas if you are supposed to have the bonds in your possession, they would naturally conclude that you had investigated to your own satisfaction." <BR><BR>The real excitement took place just a couple of months after this letterbook ends. Eastman lined up a deal to sell Catholicon, but shortly after leaving town, a previous owner took possession. "Knives and revolvers were drawn, and for a time it looked as though some one would be killed," according to the Sioux City Journal of 18 May 1893.  '

  FOOTNOTE: ' The founding document of the first Spanish settlement in what is now Texas. <BR><BR>José Vázquez Borrego (1682-1770) was a pioneer rancher who in 1750 established the first Spanish settlement north of the Rio Grande: Nuestra Señora de los Dolores Hacienda, in what is now Zapata County. It soon came under the protection of the Texas colonization program of José de Escandón (1700-1770) as the first governor of Nuevo Santander colony. Vázquez set up a ferry leading into his new settlement, making it the primary gateway across the Rio Grande during this very early period. <BR><BR>Offered here is an early manuscript transcript of the original negotiations and agreements between Vázquez and Escandón regarding the settlement at Dolores. Vázquez describes the challenges faced by his initial settlement of 12 families, including lack of water and conflicts with hostile Indians. <BR><BR>Another shorter version of this dossier is recorded in the Archivo General de la Nación in Mexico, Provincias Internas, Volume 180, leaves 63-72.

The present copy follows the Archivo General version closely from pages 1 to 12, does not include the two pages of plat maps included in the end of the Archivo General file, but continues for an additional 18 pages beyond what is contained in that file. The Archivo General copy is in a different hand and bears a scribal signature, while the present copy is unsigned. <BR><BR>Provenance: housed in a circa 1930 envelope addressed to the Rev. Jesús Prieto of Laredo (1888-1935) who came to the United States from Spain in 1921 and settled in Laredo by 1923; he was naturalized there in 1927 and apparently became interested in local history. The envelope is docketed "Jose Vasquez Borrego a Escandon," apparently in Rev. Prieto''s hand. Recently purchased from a collector in Texas.  '

There he became a prominent landholder and was named the county''s Chief Justice in 1843. Though well past the usual fighting age, he volunteered for the Confederacy in the Civil War. <BR><BR>At the heart of this lot is a humble diary kept by Patton from 5 March to 16 May 1839, with 3 additional entries written in 1842. It extends over just 5 pages on a long narrow notebook (12¼ x 4 inches) with worn paper wrappers; the two main diary leaves are detached and worn at the edges with moderate loss of text. Most of the entries make brief note of the grueling labor of frontier agriculture: splitting rails, planting corn and potatoes. Patton was also on the muster rolls as a private in the Texas Rangers during this period, and this diary describes three occasions when he was summoned for "rainging" expeditions. On 16 March, he wrote "Received orders from Capt. [James D.] Mathews [to] range tomorrow week." This expedition was described briefly on 24 March: "Went rainging with Majr. Weppler, camped on small creek after visiting Grand Praire Creek, Parkers Creek." The next day he returned home. The next mission started on 9 April: "Went rainging with Capt. Mathews & 20 men, lay near Camp Creek." The next day, "crossed Duck Creek, came to the Grand Prairae, saw buffalo & antelope, camped on the watters of Little Brasses" [Brazos]. He returned home on the third day: "The company separated, 6 of us, Capt. Reed, Hill, myself and 2 others came down Little B." Finally he noted on 29 April: "Went rainging, slep in Indian camp," and returned home the next day. <BR><BR>When not "rainging," Patton was busy ranching, farming, and participating in civic life. His longest and perhaps most dramatic entry was on 1 April: "Circuit court . . . Heard the trial of Mrs. Mompherd alias Mrs, White for bigamy, found guilty. News came in of Indians having stole horses at Timas and yesterday of driving of cattle from the settlement above Strouds. . . . Hardon found guilty of purgery, sentenced to fifty lashes & $500 fine." He discussed nearby Stroud''s Station a couple of other times: "Went Strouds with Judge Slaughter & Sqr. Owen, returned in the evening, driveing 9 cow for slaughter & beef" (30 March); "Indians at Strouds stole 2 horses" (7 April). Among the handful of later entries, 28 July 1842 stands out: "Indians stole horses Sunday night last." Early Texas diaries are rarely seen. We can trace no other manuscript civilian diaries from the Republic of Texas at auction since 2007. <BR><BR>The diary is accompanied by related papers of Edwin L. Patton and his family: 29 letters dated 1826 to 1862, and 28 accounts and legal documents dated 1835 to 1853. Brother William Patton of Sims Creek, AL, wrote on 13 October with extensive commentary on the presidential election, including rumors that "the abolitionists will yet put up a candidate of their own as Clay refuses to harmonize with them." Another brother, George Ross Patton, wrote from Green County, AL on 20 May 1844 with a detailed list of the family''s recent slave purchases, adding: "We feel considerable anxiety on the subject of the anexation of Texas to the Union and hope the friends of the polacy will act firm and fearless regardless of our political opponants both of England and America on the subject of slavery." An old friend named McElwain from Pike County, Indiana discussed politics on 28 June 1858: "Two years ago about Kansas, Duglas started the fus to win over the South for president but he can''t comit. . . . As to slavery, I''m willing to wait God time, as I think all things will move agreable to his order." As war approached, son W.W. Patton wrote from Cotton Gin, TX on 2 December 1860: "We have had a great deel of political excitement . . . we have organized a company at Cotton Gin and are trying to organize another. Cotton Gin is a fast place." A few items relate to Edwin Patton''s nephew Thomas Monroe Patton (1822-1888), also of Robertson County, including a Texas state land grant issued to and signed by Governor George T. Wood, quite worn, Austin, TX, 3 October 1849; and a letter from cousin Thomas L.C. Means of Sims Creek, SC ("there has been a great deal of sickness about Clinton and some deaths but principally among the Negroes"), 28 February 1846. <BR><BR>Son Thomas McCutcheon Patton wrote 3 times while on duty in the Confederate Army, twice from Camp Wright on Red River County, TX in August 1862, and once from Camp Camden in Arkansas, 13 September 1862. On 13 August he wrote "We heard an Indian preach. He preached in ower tung. He said it was his first time. I do not like the looks of the Indians." On 13 September he wrote that "L.W. Kidwell shot himself through the hand," complained that "Arkansis is verry poor country," and noted that his horse "came very near dying" on the march. Private Patton died two months later on 22 November. <BR><BR>WITH--a small group of family papers of William Gaston Parsons (1837-1873) of Weatherford, TX, who married Edwin Patton''s daughter Mary Louisa and served as a chaplain in the Confederate army. 27 items, including copies of his army commission and discharge, and 2 Confederate tax receipts, 1856-1915.

In this letter he reflects on the economic forces behind the Texas Revolution, and calls Sam Houston a "crusader . . . in order to perpetuate slavery." <BR><BR>"If there is any inequality in the laws of the land, it ought to be in favor of the oppressed. If I lift my arms in defense of rights not my own, it will be for the oppressed. The Mexicans, formerly one of the most powerful nations on this continent, and in 1500 the most enlightened, and now perhaps as much to boast as their would-be more enlightened neighbors, have set them an example worthy of imitation. These children of the sun have proclaimed liberty to the slave by solemn edict. Now, who are the invaders? The Mexicans or Americans? . . . The sole cause of this war was the introduction of slavery in Texas. And Houston, a fugitive from justice from his cradle, like another Peter the Hermit has commenced a crusade against the children of the sun in order to perpetuate slavery in Coahuila and Texas, a Mexican state. . . . What a fine slave-cattle market it will make. The foreign slave trade was abolished and considered a piracy. . . . The foreign trade was abolished to give protection and greater encouragement to the home trade. It cannot be denied. Virginia is a slave-raising state, and the Mississippi is the channel through which her manufactures force their surplus slaves into Louisiana and Texas." '

The brigade was recruited in the Western states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming, and was one of the first American artillery units in France, serving in many of the principal engagements of the war. <BR><BR>These photographs include candid shots of the brigade''s soldiers, local scenery including war-ravaged buildings, and the occasional dead "boche" (German soldier). Many of the scenes are from Marne and other locations on the front, with just 6 near the end showing training camps in the United States. The captioning is better than usual. Examples include "The first of the regiment: Graves of Pvts. Huff & Rude, killed by breech-block, due to premature explosion of shell in gun"; "Capt. Prell at old Roman baths, Martres à Veyres"; and "Baseball at Veyres-Gironde." On a few pages, the compiler has embellished the black scrapbook leaves with small well-executed drawings in white ink. A section of 8 pictures "taken from fallen Boche aviator" includes a well-known image of the body of ex-President Roosevelt''s son Quentin at a crash site. A pair of before-and-after shots of a ruined building is captioned "we had a kitchen here . . . For a few minutes!" A shot of several bodies stacked in a crude cart is captioned "German wounded left behind. Bottom man alive--Argonne. Some ambulance!" The larger Signal Corps photographs laid in at rear are also from the 66th Brigade, including two of General John J. Pershing and Secretary of War Newton Baker touring their camp in Bordeaux. <BR><BR>The compiler, Norman Pennicuik (1891-1980), was born to Scottish parents and came to the United States in 1907.

    otherwise minor wear to contents; signed on front free endpaper. With typed
    transcript.
  FOOTNOTE: ' Walter Leo Rau (1898-1948) was a German-American from the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston who enlisted in Battery C of the 101st Field Artillery, also known as the Boston Light Artillery. This regiment traces its roots back to its 1636 founding by John Winthrop, making it the oldest field artillery unit in the nation; it has served in virtually every major fight from the Pequot War to Iraq and Afghanistan. <BR><BR>This diary begins shortly after Rau''s arrival in France, earlier than the great wave of American troops; on the second night he was "billeted in an old shell-ruined church," and on 3 February he "went into a chamber filled with gas today with our English mask & had to change it while in there & put on our French mask . . . to test our mask." After surviving some air raids and bringing supplies to the front, he had his first combat on 17 March: "Went to front today to act as cannoneer for one day, slept in 4th section dugout. Was woke up at 4 a.m. for a big barrage. We fired from 4 a.m. till 6 a.m. at the Germans. 200 of our inf. gassed." On guard duty in Vignes, to honor Good Friday, he wandered alone into a small church in a cemetery lit by a single candle at midnight (20 March 1918). He notes the German spring offensive on 9 April 1918: "The greatest drive & attempt by the Huns & greatest battle of the war is now on. All the ammunition that can be possibly taken is being brought to the front every night." On 12 May he was arrested for taking a couple of shots at birds during target practice: "They say your not a good soldier until you''ve been in the jug." On 28 May he reported on the travails of the artillery''s brother unit: "The Germans are throwing a lot of gas over. The 101st Inf. is in front of us & they are continually making raids. A number of their men have been gassed. Heard that Jacko Murphy of C Co. went out on a patrol party & he got hit over the head by a barbed wire black jack & was killed outright." <BR><BR>Rau described the Second Battle of the Marne on 15 July: "Our guns were out in the open field. We are in open warfare now & we have no dugouts. If I ever saw anything that . . . looked like a real battle & battlefield it was this afternoon. Lieut. Smart was running around swabbing out the guns & waving his hands in the air. Lt. Kanuth was wounded, Lt. Smart gassed. . . . We are working night & day, no sleep at all. We have lost about 80 men & the men are loosing their nerves as we are continually ducking shells & are being gassed at the same time." On 17 October, "we moved over to the Verdun secteur . . . & believe me, it is some lively up here, shells landing all over the valley we were in. Lots of gas up here, loads of shell holes. . . . There is somebody in our btry being killed & wounded every day." Reinforcements arrived from the Iowa National Guard: "My pal & bunk mate in my gun crew, Swede Lundquist from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was wounded Oct 19 & went to hospital. Our guns are in what is called the Valley of Death." The mood shifts abruptly on 15 November with the armistice, followed by a grand Thanksgiving dinner; some men visited "Murphy''s Cathouse." An inspection by President Wilson and General Pershing was a highlight of the coming months; the influenza was noted on 27 December. <BR><BR>Also included in the memoranda are Rau''s itinerary for his period of service, numerous home addresses of friends and family, and transcriptions of two letters to his unit by Generals Edwards and Leclerc. After the war, Rau married and worked as a postal clerk, living in Boston and Dedham, MA.  '

    35 after the armistice through about June 1919; moderate wear, many marked
    by censors, most still folded in original postmarked envelopes.
  FOOTNOTE: ' Edward Sherman Vosburg Jr. (1889-1959) enlisted from Phillipston, PA in Clarion County northeast of Pittsburgh, joining Company F of the 55th Engineers. The regiment trained at Camp Custer in Michigan, where he wrote on 8 May 1918 "There are negroes on each side of our barricks but they never bother us." <BR><BR>His 19 July 1918 letter announces his safe arrival in France: "You should see the French people and the way they dress, also the wooden shoes they wear. After we landed from the boat we were marching along and were singing Hail, Hail, the Gang''s All Here, and the French kids started to sing it too, which shows some of the boys over here have been teaching the kids." He expressed confidence on 1 September 1918: "We are here to win the war, and the Huns are finding it out." On 2 November 1918 he boasted of his regiment''s reputation: "One of the fellows was talking to a Marine the other day, and he asked what regiment we were. . . . He said, I''ve heard of you fellows, you broke the building record." <BR><BR>Vosburg''s 24 November letter was written after "the censor is lifted," allowing him to summarize his movements in a 3-page letter: "We landed at Brest after a submarine scare. They claim they saw one when we came over, and the boat zig zagged all night. . . . We got on a train and came here to Gievres, which is a large engineers depot, the largest in France. Our company helped to build it. We put up more barricks and steel warehouses than any company here. There were some airoplane hangers to be built at Issondum and they sent for the best company of engineers, and the colonel of this camp recommended Co. F.. . . . While there, the war stopped. I laughed the day it finished. I told an old French woman who does washing for us boys that war was finished, and she went danceing up the road." On 27 November 1918 he wrote "It seems very queer to speak of the flu. We are in tents and in the open and have not been bothered with it." He describes the irony of an engineer regiment''s work on 12 December 1918: "We have built more barricks than any company in France and lived in more tents, but our bunch can fix up a tent so it is real comfortable." <BR><BR>Vosburg returned safely to Phillipston after the war, and worked as a railroad engineer as his father had.

    Approximately 380 photographs in one box, plus other supplementary material

    numbers in negative, almost all mounted on linen with binding stubs as

    reference numbers or Signal Corps stamps, many blank on verso; generally
    just minor to moderate curling and wear, with heavier wear and dampstaining
    to approximately 50 photographs.
  FOOTNOTE: ' These official Army Signal Corps photographs document the final phase of the war in Europe, Asia and the Pacific from about June 1944 through August 1945, with a few slightly later images of demobilized Japan. Approximately 80 are in strong condition and well-captioned with printed Signal Corps labels mounted on verso. Many of the images are not for the squeamish, including executed concentration camp inmates, and numerous shots of dead or wounded soldiers. Many show the ruins of German cities after Allied occupation, including one of Army medics examining a truck flipped over by a Nazi shell in Arnoldsweiler in February 1945 (illustrated). Others show Axis prisoners of war arriving in Boston; French civilians sheltering in a Maginot Line fortress; an American flag being raised at Corregidor Island; infantrymen crouching in a snow-filled trench under German shelling; a shirtless rifle-wielding Filipino guerilla scout; liberated American prisoners marching to a hospital in Luzon; the flattened ruins of Hiroshima in August 1945; and much more. Several shots of the war in Burma include "Kachin tribesmen unaccustomed to automotive transport" out for a ride with a smiling G.I. At least 3 of the images date from the Pearl Harbor attack in December 1941. <BR><BR>Also included are about 250 uncaptioned photographs in strong condition. These are accompanied by several packets of unapplied caption labels which have become adhered together; it may be possible to separate these labels and match them up with the original photographs. Google image searching has also proven successful in identifying some of these images. Also included are approximately 50 well-captioned sleeves which originally accompanied 4 x 5-inch prints. <BR><BR>Finally, we include the photo identification badge of the compiler, J.A. Griswold, a civilian with the Signal Corps Photographic Laboratory, which was apparently located on the inactive campus of the Army War College in Washington. His name appears on several packets of photographs. He can also be seen in a group photograph with other staff members, a mix of uniformed and civilian employees.  '

  FOOTNOTE: ' Simon Bolivar was already the president and founding hero of Gran Colombia in August of 1828. After a failed constitutional convention left the young nation on the brink of chaos, Bolivar declared himself dictator through the Decreto Organico (Organic Decree) of 27 August 1828. This proclamation was issued on the same day as the famous decree. Under the heading "Simon Bolivar, Libertador Presidente de Colombia &&&," It begins "Colombianos! Las voluntades publicas se habian espresado enerjicamente por las reformas politicas de la nacion." Bolivar explains why he has found it necessary to assume these extraordinary powers. He also assures his countrymen that he will not remain a dictator any longer than necessary, but in the meantime pledges to "commit myself to strictly obey your legitimate desires" ("obligo a obedecer estrictamente vuestros lejitimos deseos") and to "protect your sacred religion as the faith of all Colombians and the code of all good men; I will make justice the first law of all transactions and the universal guarantee of our citizens. . . .

A crudely hand-stitched 18-page gathering has a mid-19th century look and recipes such as Escabeche de Veracruz and Ensalada de Jicama. A 12-page unbound manuscript which starts with Otros Estofado includes recipes for Pollos en Orchata and Mole Genoves; one leaf bears a watermark reading "Guise Testa" which seems to date from circa 1840.

    Late colonial Nahuatl broadside announcing the tenure of Viceroy

  at-a-glance: 'Mexico, 15 October 1803'
  TYPESET: >-
    Letterpress broadside, 23¾ x 16¾ inches, signed in type by the author with
    his manuscript rubric, and signed by Ignacio de la Barrera as secretary;
    several small worm holes, light wear along vertical folds; uncut.
  FOOTNOTE: ' This broadside announces the transfer of power from outgoing viceroy Félix Berenguer de Marquina to José de Iturrigaray, who would serve until his arrest for his support of popular sovereignty in 1808. A rubric appears next to Iturrigaray''s printed name which he likely signed himself. <BR><BR>Examples of late colonial written Nahuatl are rare, as a late 18th-century royal decree technically forbade the official use of indigenous languages. The text also stands out because its Nahuatl is lacking in Spanish loanwords, an oddity as colonial Nahuatl documents since the 16th century were typically peppered with Spanish. Instead, Vicente de la Rosa Saldívar, the official Nahuatl interpreter of the Audiencia, translated almost every Spanish term, including ones that had already made their way into everyday Nahuatl. Even the term Nueva España (New Spain, the viceroyalty that included Mexico), which is ubiquitous in the colonial Nahuatl corpus, is here rendered as Yancuic Caxtillan, the word-for-word Nahuatl equivalent. The Nahuatl renderings of Iturrigaray''s titles are creative, with "General" appearing as "Yaoquizcá-yacanqui"--literally, "leader of going to war." Saldívar''s motivations in translating the broadside in this manner are unclear. Nahuas themselves at the time may have been purging Spanish words from their language out of a purist ethnic pride, or it may reflect a kind of creole patriotism that sought glory in the indigenous past, rather than Spanish culture. <BR><BR>The text of this rare Nahuatl broadside begins "Nocnopil Joseph de Yturrigaray Técpilli monêtolti itechpa in Tlatecpantli Santiago." None others traced in OCLC or at auction, but listed in Sabin 106220A. León-Portilla, "Tepuztlahcuilolli, impresos en náhuatl," page 98, describes it as one of only 7 viceroy''s decrees in Nahuatl. '

  FOOTNOTE: ' A portrait of Juan de Palafox y Mendoza (1600-1659), an important and influential Bishop of Puebla from 1640 to 1655 who also served briefly as Viceroy of New Spain in 1642. He established the first public library in the Americas, and defended the rights of Indians. He is best known for his lengthy power struggle with the Jesuits of New Spain. <BR><BR>This allegorical portrait was likely created in support of Palafox''s long process of beatification, which first received papal approval in 1726, and moved forward with an examination of his writings in 1758 (it was not concluded successfully until 2011). It depicts a beardless Palafox surrounded by seven women bearing emblems pertinent to his career. The caption circling his images reads in Latin "Ven Ioannes de Palafox episcopus angelopolitan et postea oxomen," surrounded by an elaborate array of saints bearing tribute. At bottom are the additional captions "Ingentes animas prograndia nomina prasal unicus, at gemino spiritu adauctus habet" and "Totus amor virtus sapienta gratis totus, cui sacra candet ovis cui sacra plaudit avis." <BR><BR>This painting appears to be the source image for at least two period engravings, and possibly three.

    moderate foxing.
  FOOTNOTE: ' This broadside in parallel Nahuatl and Spanish explains the outbreak of the Reform War and argues in favor of the Liberal cause. The anonymous author and translator identified himself only as "A Mexican." Subtitled "In altepetl ahmo tlen quimati" ("to the communities which do not know anything") [about the war], the broadside attempts to satisfy curiosity about the conflict. Addressed to a readership consisting of "those among whom there is no knowledge, but a desire for knowledge," the broadside reads like propaganda, attempting to sway its indigenous readers to the Liberal side, and pinning all recent troubles on the recklessly obstinate Conservatives. It extols the 1857 Mexican federal constitution, heralding it as a modern marvel that could bring prosperity and happiness to all Mexicans. The translator generally refrains from using common Spanish loanwords, preferring instead to use Nahuatl translations. These translations are often either exceedingly literal or ad hoc--perhaps from a belief that the Nahua audience would not understand or be hostile to Spanish terminology. Thus, they rendered Mexico''s congress, the congreso constituyente, matter-of-factly as altepetlaca or "people of the state." Nación is more metaphorically and colorfully represented as altepepachocanantzin, "the motherly state we submit to." A rare attempt by non-Indian authorities to engage with this community in their own language, long after most official uses of such languages had fallen out of favor.

    some folded items, but generally strong, a few documents apparently excised.
  FOOTNOTE: ' In colonial Mexico, the demand for printed royal and viceroyal decrees of local interest would often outstrip the supply, so lawyers, justices and other interested parties would often obtain copies. Not everything was included in the various editions of the Recopilación de Leyes de Indias. Thus lawyers would maintain their own cedularios for reference use. This one covers criminal cases, the army and navy, confiscation of property, the use of stamped paper, the royal treasury, dress codes, bigamy, and other social matters.

  TYPESET: >-
    [276] manuscript leaves, loose or bound in 14 separate documents, most of

    laid into a limp vellum wrapper, 12¼ x 8½ inches; minor wear.
  FOOTNOTE: ' These papers all relate to the estate of a family with mining interests in Aguascaliente and Bolaños. The principals are Augustina Velázquez, who died in 1780; her husband Antonio Vivanco y Gutierrez (1727-1799), a wealthy mine owner who was made Marqués de Vivanco in 1791 for his service in the Bolaños militia; and their son Antonio Guadalupe Vivanco de Velásquez (1778-1800), the second Marques, who died young, leaving a widow, an infant daughter and a complex estate situation. This packet includes: <BR><BR>[121] manuscript leaves, including dozens of receipts of various sizes, bound together. Various places, 1780-1782. Augustina Velázquez''s will ordered that numerous masses were read in her name in her home region, with priests signing receipts for the payments. One intriguing entry is a receipt for donations signed by 20 priests, including "Br. Hidalgo"--an early signature of Miguel Hidalgo (1753-1811). He had been ordained as a priest in 1773, and much later was a leader in the Mexican war of independence. During this period he was at the Colegio de San Nicolás Obispo in what is now Morelia. The initial "H" evolved in his later signatures, but the remainder is a close match. <BR><BR>"Testimonio de los autos de inventarios formados a los bienes que quedaor por muerte del Señor Don Antonio Vivanco, Marques de Vivanco."

This certificate names Pedro Cabazos of Matamoros as a Caballero (Knight) within the order. In addition to Maximilian''s bold signature, the signature of Juan Almonte (1803-1869) is notable for his close association with Santa Anna, and his important role in the Battle of the Alamo.  '

     Cosme Bueno (1711-1798) was a physician and historian who published an annual almanac in Lima, "El Conocimiento de los Tiempos," from 1757 to 1798. This longer historical work began appearing in serialized form in his almanacs in the 1760s, but was published in book form in very small numbers, if at all. It 
    describes parts of La Plata in what are now Chile, Bolivia, Perú, Argentina,
    and Paraguay, covering geography, climate, population, and religious
    activity. It was apparently circulated in manuscript form, and finally
    appeared in proper printed editions in 1902 and 1996. <BR><BR>The book (if
    there was one) was not recorded by Medina. Palau lists "Descripcion de las
    Provincias del Perú" as a 1763 Lima imprint in octavo, but with no other
    details (36683). OCLC lists one copy of "Descripción geografica de las
    Provincias pertenecientes al Reyno del Perú, Chile y Rio de la Plata" at the
    National Library of Chile, in [525] pages, with a title page in red and
    black, but it is not entirely clear whether this might be a manuscript. At
    least one similarly titled manuscript by Bueno has appeared on the market.
    The dealer Kraus sold a 42-leaf "Descripcion del Obispado de Buenos Ayres"
    in 1957, said to come from the papers of Juan Vincente, Conde de
    Revilla-Gigedo, Viceroy of Mexico (1789-1794); it later appeared at
    Sotheby's in 1966.

  FOOTNOTE: ' Second edition in French. Gage was an English Catholic who went to Spain and became ordained as a Dominican priest. Although foreigners were forbidden from traveling to the Spanish colonies, a group of Dominicans helped smuggle him in a barrel to Mexico in 1625. He ended up as a missionary in Guatemala, and desiring to return to Europe, fled in 1637 without permission from the order. In England, he abandoned Catholicism, became an Anglican, and published this book. It was the first original account of the Spanish colonies by an Englishman, and would remain the only one for many years. It also offered detailed advice for an English invasion of the colonies. This advice was heeded when the English captured Jamaica in 1655; Gage accompanied the army and died there the following year. <BR><BR>The map of the Americas depicts California as an island. "He appears to have been a believer in witchcraft and sorcery, and admits into his work many curious relations on those subjects"--Sabin 26298. European Americana 695/80; Palau 96485; Sabin 26304.  '
